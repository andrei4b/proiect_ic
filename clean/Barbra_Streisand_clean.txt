== Early life ==

=== Family ===
Barbara Joan Streisand was born on April 24, 1942, in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of Diana (born Ida Rosen) and Emanuel Streisand. Her mother had been a soprano singer in her youth and considered a career in music, but later became a school secretary. Her father was a high school teacher at the same school, where they first met. Streisand's family was Jewish; her paternal grandparents emigrated from Galicia (PolandUkraine) and her maternal grandparents from the Russian Empire, where her grandfather had been a cantor.

Her father earned a master's degree from City College of New York in 1928 and was considered athletic and handsome. As a student, he spent his summers outdoors, once working as a lifeguard and another hitchhiking through Canada. "He'd try anything," his sister Molly said. "He wasn't afraid of anything." He married Ida in 1930, two years after graduating, and became a highly respected educator with a focus on helping underprivileged and delinquent youth.Christopher Nickens, and Swensen, Karen. ''The Films of Barbra Streisand'', Citadel Press (2000){{rp|3}}

In August 1943, a few months after Streisand's first birthday, her father died suddenly at age 34 from complications from an epileptic seizure, possibly the result of a head injury years earlier.{{rp|3}} The family fell into near-poverty, with her mother working as a low-paid bookkeeper. As an adult, Streisand remembered those early years as always feeling like an "outcast," explaining, "Everybody else's father came home from work at the end of the day. Mine didn't."{{rp|3}} Her mother tried to pay their bills but could not give her daughter the attention she craved: "When I wanted love from my mother, she gave me food," Streisand says.{{rp|3}}

Streisand recalls that her mother had a "great voice" and sang semi-professionally on occasion, in her operatic soprano voice. During a visit to the Catskills when Streisand was thirteen, she told Rosie O'Donnell, she and her mother recorded some songs on tape. That session was the first time Streisand ever asserted herself as an artist, which also became her "first moment of inspiration" as an artist.[http://abc.go.com/shows/the-view/video/pl5554876/VDKA0_accgnenv Barbra Streisand Interview with Rosie Rosie O'Donnell], April 29, 2016

She has an older brother, Sheldon, and a half-sister, the singer Roslyn Kind,Hernandez, Greg.[http://www.insidesocal.com/outinhollywood/2008/01/my-chat-wroslyn-kind-streisand.html "My Chat w/Roslyn Kind: Streisand's sister is on the comeback trail..."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713040805/http://www.insidesocal.com/outinhollywood/2008/01/my-chat-wroslyn-kind-streisand.html |date=July 13, 2011 }} insidesocal.com, January 29, 2008 from her mother's remarriage to Louis Kind in 1949. Roslyn is nine years younger than Streisand.

=== Education ===
Streisand began her education at the Jewish Orthodox Yeshiva of Brooklyn when she was five. There, she was considered to be bright and extremely inquisitive about everything; however, she lacked discipline, often shouting answers to questions out of turn.{{rp|3}} She next entered Public School 89 in Brooklyn, and during those early school years began watching television and going to movies. Watching the glamorous stars on the screen, she was soon entranced by acting and now hoped someday to become an actress, partly as a means of escape: "I always wanted to be somebody, to be famous . . .You know, get out of Brooklyn.{{rp|3}}

Streisand became known by others in the neighborhood for her voice. With the other kids she remembers sitting on the stoop in front of their flat and singing: "I was considered the girl on the block with the good voice."{{rp|3}} That talent became a way for her to gain attention. She would often practice her singing in the hallway of her apartment building which gave her voice an echoing quality.

She made her singing debut at a PTA assembly, where she became a hit to everyone but her mother, who was mostly critical of her daughter. Young Streisand was invited to sing at weddings and summer camp, along with having an unsuccessful audition at MGM records when she was nine. By the time she was thirteen, her mother began supporting her talent, helping her make a four-song demo tape, including "Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart," and "You'll Never Know."{{rp|4}}

Although she knew her voice was good and she liked the attention, becoming an actress was her main objective. That desire was made stronger when she saw her first Broadway play, ''The Diary of Anne Frank,'' when she was fourteen. The star in the play was Susan Strasberg, whose acting she wanted to emulate if ever given the chance.{{rp|4}} To help achieve that goal, Streisand began spending her spare time in the library, studying the biographies of various stage actresses such as Eleanora Duse and Sarah Bernhardt. In addition, she began reading novels and plays, including some by Shakespeare and Ibsen, and also on her own, studied the acting theories of Konstantin Stanislavski and Michael Chekhov.{{rp|4}}

She attended Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn in 1955 where she became an honor student in modern history, English, and Spanish. She also joined the Freshman Chorus and Choral Club, where she sang with another choir member and classmate, Neil Diamond.Jackson, Laura. ''Neil Diamond: His Life, His Music, His Passion,'' ECW Press (2005) p. 155 Diamond recalls, "We were two poor kids in Brooklyn. We hung out in the front of Erasmus High and smoked cigarettes." The school was near an art-movie house, and he recalls that she was always aware of the films they were showing, while he wasn't as interested.''Rolling Stone'' magazine, March 21, 1996 p. 36

During the summer of 1957 she got her first stage experience as a walk-on at the Playhouse in Malden Bridge, New York. That small part was followed by a role as the kid sister in ''Picnic'' and one as a vamp in ''Desk Set.''{{rp|4}} She returned to school in Brooklyn but never took dramatic arts classes, preferring instead to gain some real-world stage experience. To that end, in her sophomore year, she took a night job at the Cherry Lane Theatre in Greenwich Village helping backstage. When she was a senior, she rehearsed for a small part in ''Driftwood'', a play staged in a midtown attic space.{{rp|5}} Her co-star in ''Driftwood'' was Joan Rivers.

At age sixteen, she graduated from Erasmus Hall in January 1959, and despite her mother's pleas that she stay out of show business, she immediately set out trying to get roles on the New York City stage.{{rp|5}} After renting a small apartment on 48th street, in the heart of the theater district, she accepted any job she could involving the stage, and at every opportunity, she "made the rounds" of the casting offices.{{rp|5}}

== Career beginnings ==
thumb|Barbra Streisand, c. 1962.
At sixteen, then living on her own, Streisand's youth and ambition worked in her favor, but she lacked a mature woman's physical features which were needed for serious female roles. She therefore took various menial jobs to have some income. At one period, she lacked a permanent address, and found herself sleeping at the home of friends or anywhere else she could set up the army cot she carried around to save on rent expense. When desperate, she would return to her mother's flat in Brooklyn for a home-cooked meal. However, her mother would be horrified by her daughter's "gypsy-like lifestyle," wrote biographer Karen Swenson, and again begged her to give up trying to get into show business;{{rp|6}} but Streisand took her mother's pleadings as even more reason to keep trying: "My desires were strengthened by wanting to prove to my mother that I ''could'' be a star."{{rp|6}}

She took a job as an usher at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater for ''The Sound of Music'', early in 1960. During the run of the play, she heard that the casting director was auditioning for more singers, and it marked the first time she sang in pursuit of a job.{{rp|6}} Although the director felt she was not right for the part, he encouraged her to begin including her talent as a singer on her rsum when looking for other work.{{rp|6}}

That suggestion prodded Streisand to think seriously about a singing career, in addition to acting. She asked her boyfriend, Barry Dennen, to tape her singing, copies of which she could then give out to possible employers. Dennen had acted with her briefly in an off-Broadway play, but had no reason to think she had any talent as a singer, and she never mentioned it. Nevertheless, he agreed and found a guitarist to accompany her:

{{quote|We spent the afternoon taping, and the moment I heard the first playback I went insane. . . . This nutty little kook had one of the most breathtaking voices I'd ever heard . . . when she was finished and I turned off the machine, I needed a long moment before I dared look up at her.{{rp|6}}}}

Dennen grew enthusiastic and he convinced her to enter a talent contest at the Lion, a gay nightclub in Manhattan's Greenwich Village. She performed two songs, after which there was a "stunned silence" from the audience, followed by "thunderous applause" when she was pronounced the winner.{{rp|7}} She was invited back and sang at the club for several weeks. It was during this time that she dropped the second "a" from her first name, switching from "Barbara" to "Barbra", due to her dislike of her original name.

=== Nightclub shows and Broadway stage ===
Streisand was next asked to audition at the Bon Soir nightclub, after which she was signed up at $125 a week. It became her first professional engagement, in September 1960, where she was the opening act for comedian Phyllis Diller. She recalls it was the first time she had been in that kind of upscale environment: "I'd never been in a nightclub until I sang in one."{{rp|7}}

Dennen now wanted to expose Streisand to his vast record collection of female singers, including Billie Holiday, Mabel Mercer, Ethel Waters, and dith Piaf. His effort made a difference in her developing style as she gained new respect for the art of popular singing. She also realized she could still become an actress by first gaining recognition as a singer.{{rp|7}}  According to biographer Christopher Nickens, hearing other great female singers benefited her style, as she began creating different emotional characters when performing, which gave her singing a greater range.

Feeling more self-confident, she improved her stage presence when speaking to the audience between songs. She discovered that her Brooklyn-bred style of humor was received quite favorably.{{rp|8}} During the next six months appearing at the club, some began comparing her singing voice to famous names such as Judy Garland, Lena Horne and Fanny Brice. Her conversational ability to charm an audience with spontaneous humor during performances became more sophisticated and professional.{{rp|8}} Theater critic Leonard Harris, in one of his reviews, could already envision her future success: "She's twenty; by the time she's thirty she will have rewritten the record books."{{rp|9}}

Streisand never lost her desire to be a stage actress and accepted her first role on the New York stage in ''Another Evening with Harry Stoones'', a satirical comedy play in which she acted and sang two solos. The show received terrible reviews and closed the next day. With the help of her new personal manager, Martin Erlichman, she had successful shows in Detroit and St. Louis. Erlichman then booked her at an even more upscale nightclub in Manhattan, Blue Angel, where she became a bigger hit during the period of 1961 to 1962. Streisand once told Jimmy Fallon, whom she sang a duet with,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEa_deCZaNA "Jimmy Fallon and Barbra Streisand"], fair use clip {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312122355/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEa_deCZaNA |date=March 12, 2016 }} on the ''Tonight Show'', that Erlichman was a "fantastic manager" and still managed her career after 50 years.video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY_LpxYuGg4&t=4m Barbra Streisand on the ''Tonight Show'', 2014]. fair use clip

While appearing at Blue Angel, theater director and playwright Arthur Laurents asked her to audition for a new musical comedy he was directing, ''I Can Get It for You Wholesale''. She got the part of secretary to the lead actor businessman, played by then unknown Elliott Gould.{{rp|9}} They fell in love during rehearsals and eventually moved into a small apartment together. The show opened on March 22, 1962, at the Shubert Theater, and received rave reviews. Her performance "stopped the show cold," wrote Nickens,{{rp|9}} and she became Broadway's most exciting and youngest new star.{{rp|10}} Groucho Marx, while hosting the ''Tonight Show'', told her that twenty was an "extremely young age to be a success on Broadway."video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoAX-pgMHZI Barbra Streisand on ''The Tonight Show''], hosted by Groucho Marx, August 21, 1962  fair use clip Streisand received a Tony nomination and New York Drama Critic's prize for Best Supporting Actress.video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bQ62sL8JtU Barbra Streisand on the ''Tonight Show'', hosted by Johnny Carson], October 4, 1962  fair use clip The show was recorded and it was the first time the public could purchase an album of her singing.{{rp|10}}

=== Television appearances, marriage, and first albums ===
Streisand's first television appearance was on ''The Tonight Show'', then credited to its usual host Jack Paar. She was seen during an April 1961 episode on which Orson Bean substituted for Paar.  She sang Harold Arlen's "A Sleepin' Bee". During her appearance, Phyllis Diller, also a guest on the show, called her "one of the great singing talents in the world."video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DXvLD-pxms Barbra Streisand on the Jack Paar Show, 1961]  fair use clip

Later in 1961, before she was cast in ''Another Evening With Harry Stoones'', she became a semi-regular on ''PM East/PM West'', a talk/variety series hosted by Mike Wallace and Joyce Davidson.

In May 1962, Streisand appeared on ''The Garry Moore Show'' where she sang "Happy Days Are Here Again" for the first time. Her sad, slow version of the 1930s upbeat Democratic Party theme song became her signature song during this early phase of her career.{{rp|10}}

Johnny Carson had her on the ''Tonight Show'' half a dozen times in 1962 and 1963, and she became a favorite of his television audience and himself personally. He described her as an "exciting new singer."[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAS8BDDV8uM Barbra Streisand on Johnny Carson's ''Tonight Show'', 1962]  fair use clip During one show, she joked with Groucho Marx who liked her style of humor.{{rp|10}}

In December 1962, she made the first of a number of appearances on the Ed Sullivan Show. She was later a cohost on the Mike Douglas Show, and also made an impact on a number of Bob Hope specials. Performing with her on the Ed Sullivan Show was Liberace who became an instant fan of the young singer. Liberace invited her to Las Vegas, Nevada, to perform as his opening act at the Riviera Hotel. Liberace is credited with introducing Barbra to Western American audiences.Thomas, Bob, (1987) "Liberace, The True Story." (London, Weidenfeld and Nicolson). The following September during her ongoing shows at Harrah's Hotel in Lake Tahoe, she and Elliott Gould took time off to get married in Carson City, Nevada. With her career and popularity rising so quickly, she saw her marriage to Gould as a "stabilizing influence."{{rp|11}}

Her first album, ''The Barbra Streisand Album'' in early 1963, made the top 10 on the ''Billboard'' chart and won three Grammy Awards.{{rp|11}} The album made her the best-selling female vocalist in the country.{{rp|11}} That summer she also released ''The Second Barbra Streisand Album'', which established her as the "most exciting new personality since Elvis Presley."{{rp|11}} She ended that breakthrough year of 1963 by performing one-night concerts in Indianapolis, San Jose, Chicago, Sacramento, and Los Angeles.{{rp|11}}

Streisand returned to Broadway in 1964 with an acclaimed performance as entertainer Fanny Brice in ''Funny Girl'' at the Winter Garden Theatre. The show introduced two of her signature songs, "People" and "Don't Rain on My Parade." Because of the play's overnight success, she appeared on the cover of ''Time''. In 1964 Streisand was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical but lost to Carol Channing in ''Hello, Dolly!'' Streisand received an honorary "Star of the Decade" Tony Award in 1970.

In 1966, she repeated her success with ''Funny Girl'' in London's West End at the Prince of Wales Theatre.  From 1965 to 1968 she appeared in her first four solo television specials.

=== Singing ===
Streisand has recorded 50 studio albums, almost all with Columbia Records. Her early works in the 1960s (her debut ''The Barbra Streisand Album'', ''The Second Barbra Streisand Album'', ''The Third Album'', ''My Name Is Barbra'', etc.) are considered classic renditions of theatre and cabaret standards, including her pensive version of the normally uptempo "Happy Days Are Here Again". She performed this in a duet with Judy Garland on ''The Judy Garland Show''.  Garland referred to her on the air as one of the last great belters.  They also sang "There's No Business Like Show Business" with Ethel Merman joining them.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7AViKc52P0 Barbra Streisand, Judy Garland, and Ethel Merman on "The Judy Garland Show"], 1963

thumb|left|On ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' in 1969
Beginning with ''My Name Is Barbra'', her early albums were often medley-filled keepsakes of her television specials. Starting in 1969, she began attempting more contemporary material, but like many talented singers of the day, she found herself out of her element with rock. Her vocal talents prevailed, and she gained newfound success with the pop and ballad-oriented Richard Perry-produced album ''Stoney End'' in 1971. The title track, written by Laura Nyro, was a major hit for Streisand.

During the 1970s, she was also highly prominent on the pop charts, with Top 10 recordings such as "The Way We Were" (US No. 1), "Evergreen (Love Theme from A Star Is Born)" (US No. 1), "No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)" (1979, with Donna Summer), which as of 2010 is reportedly still the most commercially successful duet, (US No. 1), "You Don't Bring Me Flowers" (with Neil Diamond) (US No. 1) and "The Main Event" (US No. 3), some of which came from soundtrack recordings of her films. As the 1970s ended, Streisand was named the most successful female singer in the U.S.  only Elvis Presley and The Beatles had sold more albums. In 1980, she released her best-selling effort to date, the Barry Gibb-produced ''Guilty''. The album contained the hits "Woman in Love" (which spent several weeks on top of the pop charts in the fall of 1980), "Guilty", and "What Kind of Fool".

After years of largely ignoring Broadway and traditional pop music in favor of more contemporary material, Streisand returned to her musical-theater roots with 1985's ''The Broadway Album'', which was unexpectedly successful, holding the coveted No. 1 Billboard position for three straight weeks, and being certified quadruple platinum. The album featured tunes by Rodgers and Hammerstein, George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, and Stephen Sondheim, who was persuaded to rework some of his songs especially for this recording. ''The Broadway Album'' was met with acclaim, including a Grammy nomination for album of the year and handed Streisand her eighth Grammy as Best Female Vocalist. After releasing the live album ''One Voice'' in 1986, Streisand was set to release another album of Broadway songs in 1988. She recorded several cuts for the album under the direction of Rupert Holmes, including "On My Own" (from ''Les Misrables''), a medley of "How Are Things in Glocca Morra?" and "Heather on the Hill" (from ''Finian's Rainbow'' and ''Brigadoon'', respectively), "All I Ask of You" (from ''The Phantom of the Opera''), "Warm All Over" (from ''The Most Happy Fella'') and an unusual solo version of "Make Our Garden Grow" (from ''Candide''). Streisand was not happy with the direction of the project and it was scrapped. Only "Warm All Over" and a reworked, lite FM-friendly version of "All I Ask of You" were ever released, the latter appearing on Streisand's 1988 effort, ''Till I Loved You''. At the beginning of the 1990s, Streisand started focusing on her film directorial efforts and became almost inactive in the recording studio. In 1991, a four-disc box set, ''Just for the Record'', was released. A compilation spanning Streisand's entire career to date, it featured over 70 tracks of live performances, greatest hits, rarities and previously unreleased material.

The following year, Streisand's concert fundraising events helped propel President Bill Clinton into the spotlight and into office. Streisand later introduced Clinton at his inauguration in 1993. Streisand's music career, however, was largely on hold. A 1992 appearance at an APLA benefit as well as the aforementioned inaugural performance hinted that Streisand was becoming more receptive to the idea of live performances. A tour was suggested, though Streisand would not immediately commit to it, citing her well-known stage fright as well as security concerns. During this time, Streisand finally returned to the recording studio and released ''Back to Broadway'' in June 1993. The album was not as universally lauded as its predecessor, but it did debut at No. 1 on the pop charts (a rare feat for an artist of Streisand's age, especially given that it relegated Janet Jackson's ''Janet'' to the No. 2 spot). One of the album's highlights was a medley of "I Have A Love" / "One Hand, One Heart", a duet with Johnny Mathis, who Streisand said is one of her favorite singers.

In 1993, ''The New York Times'' music critic Stephen Holden wrote that Streisand "enjoys a cultural status that only one other American entertainer, Frank Sinatra, has achieved in the last half century".  In September 1993, Streisand announced her first public concert appearances in 27 years (if one does not count her Las Vegas nightclub performances between 1969 and 1972). What began as a two-night New Year's event at the MGM Grand Las Vegas led to a multi-city tour in the summer of 1994. Tickets for the tour were sold out in under an hour. Streisand also appeared on the covers of major magazines in anticipation of what ''Time magazine'' named "The Music Event of the Century". The tour was one of the biggest all-media merchandise parlays in history. Ticket prices ranged from US$50 to US$1,500, making Streisand the highest-paid concert performer in history. ''Barbra Streisand: The Concert'' went on to be the top-grossing concert of the year and earned five Emmy Awards and the Peabody Award, while the taped broadcast on HBO was the highest-rated concert special in HBO's 30-year history.  Following the tour's conclusion, Streisand once again kept a low profile musically, instead focusing her efforts on acting and directing duties as well as a burgeoning romance with actor James Brolin.

In 1996, Streisand released "I Finally Found Someone" as a duet with Canadian singer and songwriter Bryan Adams. The song was nominated for an Oscar as it was part of the soundtrack of Streisand's self-directed movie ''The Mirror Has Two Faces''. It reached #8 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was her first significant hit in almost a decade and her first top 10 hit on the Hot 100 (and first gold single) since 1981.

In 1997, she finally returned to the recording studio, releasing ''Higher Ground'', a collection of songs of a loosely inspirational nature which also featured a duet with Cline Dion. The album received generally favorable reviews and once again debuted at No. 1 on the pop charts. Following her marriage to Brolin in 1998, Streisand recorded an album of love songs entitled ''A Love Like Ours'' the following year. Reviews were mixed, with many critics complaining about the somewhat syrupy sentiments and overly-lush arrangements; however, it did produce a modest hit for Streisand in the country-tinged "If You Ever Leave Me", a duet with Vince Gill.

On New Year's Eve 1999, Streisand returned to the concert stage, selling out in the first few hours, eight months before her return. At the end of the millennium, she was the number one female singer in the U.S., with at least two No. 1 albums in each decade since she began performing. A two-disc live album of the concert entitled ''Timeless: Live in Concert'' was released in 2000. Streisand performed versions of the ''Timeless'' concert in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, in early 2000. In advance of four concerts (two each in Los Angeles and New York) in September 2000, Streisand announced that she was retiring from playing public concerts. Her performance of the song "People" was broadcast on the Internet via America Online.

Streisand's most recent albums have been ''Christmas Memories'' (2001), a somewhat somber collection of holiday songs, and ''The Movie Album'' (2003), featuring famous film themes and backed by a large symphony orchestra. ''Guilty Pleasures'' (called ''Guilty Too'' in the UK), a collaboration with Barry Gibb and a sequel to their ''Guilty'', was released worldwide in 2005.

In February 2006, Streisand recorded the song "Smile" alongside Tony Bennett at Streisand's Malibu home. The song is included on Bennett's 80th birthday album, ''Duets''. In September 2006, the pair filmed a live performance of the song for a special directed by Rob Marshall entitled ''Tony Bennett: An American Classic''. The special aired on NBC November 21, 2006, and was released on DVD the same day. Streisand's duet with Bennett opened the special. In 2006, Streisand announced her intent to tour again, in an effort to raise money and awareness for multiple issues. After four days of rehearsal at the Sovereign Bank Arena in Trenton, New Jersey, the tour began on October 4 at the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia, continued with a featured stop in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, (this was the concert Streisand chose to film for a TV special), and concluded at Staples Center in Los Angeles on November 20, 2006. Special guests Il Divo were interwoven throughout the show. The show was known as ''Streisand: The Tour''.

Streisand's 20-concert tour set box-office records. At the age of 64, she grossed $92,457,062 and set house gross records in 14 of the 16 arenas played on the tour. She set the third-place record for her show of October 9, 2006 at Madison Square Garden, the first- and second-place records, of which are held by her two shows in September 2000. She set the second-place record at MGM Grand Garden Arena with her December 31, 1999, show being the house record and highest-grossing concert of all time. This led many people to openly criticize Streisand for price gouging as many tickets sold for upwards of $1,000.

A collection of performances culled from different stops on this tour, ''Live in Concert 2006'', debuted at No. 7 on the ''Billboard'' 200, making it Streisand's 29th Top 10 album. In the summer of 2007, Streisand gave concerts for the first time in continental Europe. The first concert took place in Zrich (June 18), then Vienna (June 22), Paris (June 26), Berlin (June 30), Stockholm (July 4, canceled), Manchester (July 10) and Celbridge, near Dublin (July 14), followed by three concerts in London (July 18, 22 and  25), the only European city where Streisand had performed before 2007. Tickets for the London dates cost between 100.00 and 1,500.00, and for Ireland, between 118 and 500. The Ireland date was marred by issues with serious parking and seating problems leading to the event's being dubbed a fiasco by ''Hot Press''. The tour included a 58-piece orchestra.

In February 2008, ''Forbes'' listed Streisand as the No.-2-earning female musician between June 2006 and June 2007 with earnings of about $60million.

On February 1, 2010, Streisand joined over eighty other artists in recording a new version of the 1985 charity single "We Are the World". Quincy Jones and Lionel Richie planned to release the new version to mark the 25th anniversary of its original recording. These plans changed, however, in view of the devastating earthquake that hit Haiti on January 12, 2010, and on February 12, the song, now called "We Are the World 25 for Haiti", made its debut as a charity single to support relief aid for the island nation.

In 2011, Streisand sang ''Somewhere'' from the Broadway musical ''West Side Story'', with child prodigy Jackie Evancho, on Evancho's album ''Dream with Me''.

Her first film was a reprise of her Broadway hit, ''Funny Girl'' (1968), an artistic and commercial success directed by Hollywood veteran William Wyler.  Streisand won the 1968 Academy Award for Best Actress for the role, sharing it with Katharine Hepburn (''The Lion in Winter''), the only time there has been a tie in this Oscar category. Her next two movies were also based on musicals, Jerry Herman's ''Hello, Dolly!'', directed by Gene Kelly (1969); and Alan Jay Lerner's and Burton Lane's ''On a Clear Day You Can See Forever'', directed by Vincente Minnelli (1970); while her fourth film was based on the Broadway play ''The Owl and the Pussycat'' (1970).

During the 1970s, Streisand starred in several screwball comedies, including ''What's Up, Doc?'' (1972) and ''The Main Event'' (1979), both co-starring Ryan O'Neal, and ''For Pete's Sake'' (1974) with Michael Sarrazin.  One of her most famous roles during this period was in the drama ''The Way We Were'' (1973) with Robert Redford, for which she received an Academy Award nomination as Best Actress. She earned her second Academy Award for Best Original Song (with lyricist Paul Williams) for the song "Evergreen", from ''A Star Is Born'' in 1976, in which she also starred.

Along with Paul Newman, Sidney Poitier and later Steve McQueen, Streisand formed First Artists Production Company in 1969 so actors could secure properties and develop movie projects for themselves. Streisand's initial outing with First Artists was ''Up the Sandbox'' (1972).

Streisand produced a number of her own films, setting up Barwood Films in 1972. The first film she made, ''Yentl'' (1983), was turned down by every Hollywood studio at least once when she asked to not only direct the picture, but also to star in the film, until Orion Pictures took on the project and gave the film a budget of $14 million. For ''Yentl'' (1983), she was producer, director, and star, an experience she repeated for ''The Prince of Tides'' (1991) and ''The Mirror Has Two Faces'' (1996). There was controversy when ''Yentl'' received five Academy Award nominations, but none for the major categories of Best Picture, Actress, or Director.[http://www.filmsite.org/aa83.html ''1983 Academy Awards Winners and History'']. Filmsite.com. ''The Prince of Tides'' received even more Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Screenplay, although not for director. Upon completion of the film, its screenwriter, Pat Conroy, who also authored the novel, called Streisand "a goddess who walks upon the earth."{{rp|xii}}

Streisand also scripted ''Yentl'', something for which she is not always given credit. According to ''The New York Times'' editorial page editor Andrew Rosenthal in an interview with Allan Wolper, "The one thing that makes Barbra Streisand crazy is when nobody gives her the credit for having written ''Yentl''."

In 2004, Streisand made a return to film acting after an eight-year hiatus, in the comedy ''Meet the Fockers'' (a sequel to ''Meet the Parents''), playing opposite Dustin Hoffman, Ben Stiller, Blythe Danner and Robert De Niro.

In 2005, Streisand's Barwood Films, Gary Smith, and Sonny Murray purchased the rights to Simon Mawer's book ''Mendel's Dwarf''. In December 2008, she stated that she was considering directing an adaptation of Larry Kramer's play ''The Normal Heart'', a project she has worked on since the mid-1990s.

In December 2010, Streisand appeared in ''Little Fockers'', the third film from the ''Meet the Parents'' trilogy.  She reprised the role of Roz Focker alongside Dustin Hoffman.

On January 28, 2011, ''The Hollywood Reporter'' announced that Paramount Pictures had given the green light to begin shooting the road-trip comedy ''My Mother's Curse'', with Seth Rogen playing Streisand's character's son. Anne Fletcher directed the project with a script by Dan Fogelman, produced by Lorne Michaels, John Goldwyn, and Evan Goldberg. Executive producers included Streisand, Rogen, Fogelman, and David Ellison, whose Skydance Productions co-financed the road movie.  Shooting began in spring 2011 and wrapped in July; the film's title was eventually altered to ''The Guilt Trip'', and the movie was released in December 2012.

== Artistry ==
Whitney Balliett wrote, "Streisand wows her listeners with her shrewd dynamics (in-your-ear soft here, elbowing-loud there), her bravura climbs, her rolling vibrato, and the singular Streisand-from-Brooklyn nasal quality of her voice  a voice as immediately recognizable in its way as Louis Armstrong's." Music writer Allegra Rossi adds that Streisand creates complete compositions in her head:

{{quote|Even though she can't read or write music, Barbra hears melodies as completed compositions in her head. She hears a melody and takes it in, learning it quickly. Barbra developed her ability to sustain long notes because she wanted to. She can mold a tune that others cannot; she's able to sing between song and speech, keeping in tune, carrying rhythm and meaning.Rossi, Allegra. ''Barbra: A Retrospective'', Sterling Publishing, N.Y. (2012) pp. 176-179{{Efn|Rossi gives an example of how Streisand's songs are infused with meaning, such as in the film ''A Star is Born''. A clip of her singing "Evergreen" with co-star Kris Kristofferson shows him horsing around with her as she sang, and the look of "pure seduction" she gave him in return is seen in her eyes and heard in her voice. "When Barbra's singing, she's singing just for you."video clip:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0f1cMYF91A  Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson in ''A Star is Born'']}}}}

While she is predominantly a pop singer, Streisand's voice has been described as "semi-operatic" due to its strength and quality of tone. According to Adam Feldman of ''Time Out'', Streisand's "signature vocal style" is "a suspension bridge between old-school belting and microphone pop." She is known for her ability to hold relatively high notes, both loud and soft, with great intensity, as well as for her ability to make slight but unobtrusive embellishments on a melodic line. The former quality led classical pianist Glenn Gould to call himself "a Streisand freak".

In recent years, critics and audiences have noted that her voice has "lowered and acquired an occasionally husky edge". However, ''New York Times'' music critic Stephen Holden noted that her distinctive tone and musical instincts remain, and that she still "has the gift of conveying a primal human longing in a beautiful sound". Paul Taylor of ''The Independent ''wrote that Streisand "has sounded a little scratchy and frayed, though the stout resolve and superb technique with which Streisand manages to hoist it over these difficulties has come to seem morally as well aesthetically impressive." Reviewing Streisand's most recent studio effort ''Partners'', Gil Naveh of ''Haaretz ''described Streisand's voice as "velvety, clear and powerful  and the passing years have given it a fascinating depth and roughness."

Writing about the relationship in his 2009 autobiography, Agassi said: "We agree that we're good for each other, and so what if she's twenty-eight years older?

=== Name ===
Streisand changed her name from "Barbara" to "Barbra" because, she said, "I hated the name, but I refused to change it." Streisand further explained, "Well, I was 18 and I wanted to be unique, but I didn't want to change my name because that was too false. You know, people were saying you could be Joanie Sands, or something like that. (My middle name is Joan.) And I said, 'No, let's see, if I take out the 'a,' it's still 'Barbara,' but it's unique." A 1967 biography with a concert program said, "the spelling of her first name is an instance of partial rebellion: she was advised to change her last name and retaliated by dropping an "a" from the first instead."

== "Streisand effect" ==
thumb|The image of Streisand's [[Malibu, California|Malibu house that led to the naming of the effect]]
{{Main article|Streisand effect}}
In 2003, Streisand sued aerial photographer Kenneth Adelman for displaying a photograph of her Malibu, California home, along with 12,000 other photos of the California coastline taken to illustrate coastal erosion. The picture had at that point been downloaded a total of six times, two of which were by Streisand's lawyers. The suit had the unintended consequence of drawing attention to the photograph, which suddenly became wildly popular and was rapidly copied to multiple mirror sites outside the immediate reach of US law. Her lawsuit was eventually dismissed under the anti-Strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP) provisions of California law and she was ordered to pay Adelman's legal fees.''Streisand v. Adelman, et al., in California Superior Court; Case SC077257'' Mike Masnick of Techdirt coined the term "Streisand effect" in January 2005 to describe the publicity generated by Streisand's efforts to suppress the publication of the photograph.

== Awards and nominations ==

=== Music awards ===
Streisand has been nominated 43 times for a Grammy Award, winning eight. In addition, she has received two special non-competitive awards; the 1992 Grammy Legend Award and the 1994 Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. She has also been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame four times. In 2011, she was honored as MusiCares Person of the Year by the Grammy Foundation for her artistic achievement in the music industry.
