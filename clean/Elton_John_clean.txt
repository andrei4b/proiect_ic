'''Sir Elton Hercules John''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|CBE}} (born '''Reginald Kenneth Dwight'''; 25 March 1947){{Who's Who | surname = JOHN | othernames =  Sir Elton | id =  U22070 | volume = 2015 | edition = online Oxford University Press|subscription=y}} is an English singer, pianist, and composer. He has worked with lyricist Bernie Taupin as his songwriting partner since 1967; they have collaborated on more than 30 albums to date. In his five-decade career Elton John has sold more than 300{{nbsp}}million records, making him one of the best-selling music artists in the world. He has more than fifty Top 40 hits, including seven consecutive No. 1 US albums, 58 ''Billboard'' Top 40 singles, 27 Top 10, four No. 2 and nine No. 1. For 31 consecutive years (19702000) he had at least one song in the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. His tribute single "Candle in the Wind 1997", rewritten in dedication to Princess Diana, sold over 33{{nbsp}}million copies worldwide and is the best-selling single in the history of the UK and US singles charts.

John owned Watford Football Club from 1976 to 1987, and 1997 to 2002. He is an honorary Life President of the club, and in 2014 had a stand named after him at the club's home stadium.

Raised in the Pinner area of London, John learned to play piano at an early age, and by 1962 had formed Bluesology. John met his songwriting partner, Bernie Taupin, in 1967, after they had both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years they wrote songs for other artists, including Lulu, and John also worked as a session musician for artists such as the Hollies and the Scaffold. In 1969 his debut album, ''Empty Sky'', was released. In 1970 a single, "Your Song", from his second album, ''Elton John'', reached the top ten in the UK and the US, his first hit single. After decades of commercial chart success, John has also achieved success in musical theatre, both in the West End and on Broadway, composing the music for ''The Lion King'' (film and musical), ''Aida'' and ''Billy Elliot the Musical''.

He has received five Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards winning two awards for Outstanding Contribution to Music and the first Brits Icon in 2013 for his "lasting impact on British culture", an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Tony Award, a Disney Legends award, and the Kennedy Center Honors in 2004. In 2004, ''Rolling Stone'' ranked him Number 49 on its list of 100 influential musicians of the rock and roll era. In 2013, ''Billboard'' ranked him the most successful male solo artist on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists (third overall behind the Beatles and Madonna). He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, is an inductee into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. Having been named a Commander of the British Empire in 1996, John was made a Knight Bachelor by Elizabeth II for "services to music and charitable services" in 1998. John has performed at a number of royal events, such as the funeral of Princess Diana at Westminster Abbey in 1997, the Party at the Palace in 2002 and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert outside Buckingham Palace in 2012.

He has been heavily involved in the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s. In 1992, he established the Elton John AIDS Foundation and a year later began hosting the annual Academy Award Party, which has since become one of the highest-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry. Since its inception, the foundation has raised over {{US$|200million|link=yes}}. John, who announced he was bisexual in 1976 and has been openly gay since 1988, entered into a civil partnership with David Furnish on 21 December 2005, and after same-sex marriage became legal in England and Wales in 2014, wed Furnish on 21 December 2014. On 24 January 2018, it was announced that John would be retiring from touring and would soon embark on a three-year farewell tour, which is set to begin in September 2018.

== Life and career ==

=== Early life ===
Elton John was born Reginald Kenneth Dwight on 25 March 1947, in Pinner, Middlesex, the eldest child of Stanley Dwight (19251991) and only child of Sheila Eileen (ne Harris; 19252017), and was raised in a council house by his maternal grandparents, in Pinner. His parents married in 1945,GRO Register of Marriages: MAR 1945 3a 1257 Dwight Stanley = Harris Sheila E when the family moved to a nearby semi-detached house. He was educated at Pinner Wood Junior School, Reddiford School and Pinner County Grammar School, until the age of 17, when he left just prior to his A-Level examinations to pursue a career in the music industry.Elizabeth Rosenthal, ''His Song: The Musical Journey of Elton John'', Billboard Books, 2001.

When he began to seriously consider a career in music, Elton John's father, who served as a flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force, tried to steer him toward a more conventional career, such as banking. John has stated that his wild stage costumes and performances were his way of letting go after such a restrictive childhood. Both of John's parents were musically inclined, his father having been a trumpet player with the Bob Millar Band, a semi-professional big band that played at military dances. The Dwights were keen record buyers, exposing John to the popular singers and musicians of the day, and John remembers being immediately hooked on rock and roll when his mother brought home records by Elvis Presley and Bill Haley & His Comets in 1956.

Elton John started playing the piano at the age of three, and within a year, his mother heard him picking out Winifred Atwell's "The Skater's Waltz" by ear. After performing at parties and family gatherings, at the age of 7 he took up formal piano lessons. He showed musical aptitude at school, including the ability to compose melodies, and gained some notoriety by playing like Jerry Lee Lewis at school functions.  At the age of 11, he won a junior scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music. According to one of his instructors, John promptly played back, like a "gramophone record", a four-page piece by Handel that he heard for the first time.
thumb|right|Elton studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London for five years.
For the next five years, he attended Saturday classes at the Academy in central London, and has stated that he enjoyed playing Chopin and Bach and singing in the choir during Saturday classes, but that he was not otherwise a diligent classical student.  "I kind of resented going to the Academy", he says.  "I was one of those children who could just about get away without practising and still pass, scrape through the grades." He has claimed that he would sometimes skip classes and ride around on the Tube. Several instructors have testified that he was a "model student", and during the last few years, he was taking lessons from a private tutor in addition to his classes at the Academy.

Elton John's mother, though also strict with her son, was more vivacious than her husband, and something of a free spirit.  With Stanley Dwight uninterested in his son and often physically absent, John was raised primarily by his mother and maternal grandmother.  When his father was home, the Dwights would have terrible arguments that greatly distressed their son. When John was 14, they divorced. His mother then married a local painter, Fred Farebrother, a caring and supportive stepfather whom John affectionately referred to as "Derf", his first name in reverse. They moved into flat No.1A in an eight-unit apartment building called Frome Court, not far from both previous homes.  It was there that John wrote the songs that launched his career as a rock star; he lived there until he had four albums simultaneously in the American Top 40.

{{See also|Bluesology}}
At the age of 15, with the help of his mother and stepfather, Reginald Dwight became a weekend pianist at a nearby pub, the Northwood Hills Hotel, playing Thursday to Sunday nights. Known simply as "Reggie", he played a range of popular standards, including songs by Jim Reeves and Ray Charles, as well as songs he had written himself.{{sfn|Bernadin|Stanton|1996|p=70}} A stint with a short-lived group called the Corvettes rounded out his time.

In 1962, Dwight and his friends formed a band called Bluesology. By day, he ran errands for a music publishing company; he divided his nights between solo gigs at a London hotel bar and working with Bluesology. By the mid-1960s, Bluesology was backing touring American soul and R&B musicians like the Isley Brothers, Major Lance and Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles. In 1966, the band became musician Long John Baldry's supporting band, and played 16 times at the Marquee Club.

In 1967, Dwight answered an advertisement in the British magazine ''New Musical Express'', placed by Ray Williams, then the A&R manager for Liberty Records. At their first meeting, Williams gave Dwight an unopened envelope of lyrics written by Bernie Taupin, who had answered the same ad. Dwight wrote music for the lyrics, and then posted it to Taupin, beginning a partnership that {{as of |2012 |alt=still continues}}. When the two first met in 1967, they recorded what would become the first Elton John/Bernie Taupin song: "Scarecrow". Six months later Dwight was going by the name "Elton John" in homage to two members of Bluesology: saxophonist Elton Dean and vocalist Long John Baldry. His name was legally changed to Elton Hercules John on 7 January 1972.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/45571/page/403/data.pdf

The team of Elton John and Bernie Taupin joined Dick James's DJM Records as staff songwriters in 1968, and over the next two years wrote material for various artists, among them Roger Cook and Lulu. Taupin would write a batch of lyrics in under an hour and give it to John, who would write music for them in half an hour, disposing of the lyrics if he couldn't come up with anything quickly. For two years, they wrote easy-listening tunes for James to peddle to singers. Their early output included a contender for the UK entry for the Eurovision Song Contest in 1969, for Lulu, called "I Can't Go On (Living Without You)". It came sixth of six songs. In 1969, John provided piano for Roger Hodgson on his first released single, "Mr. Boyd" by Argosy, a quartet that was completed by Caleb Quaye and Nigel Olsson.Joynson, Vernon (1995).

London: Borderline Books. See entry on "Argosy". Elton John was also a session musician for other artists including playing piano on the Hollies' "He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother" and singing backing vocals for the Scaffold.In his 1981 book "Thank U Very Much  Mike McCartney's Family Album" Scaffold singer Mike McGear (McCartney) describes a meeting with John during which John advises him he used to sing background vocals for the group.

On the advice of music publisher Steve Brown, John and Taupin started writing more complex songs for John to record for DJM. The first was the single "I've Been Loving You" (1968), produced by Caleb Quaye, former Bluesology guitarist. In 1969, with Quaye, drummer Roger Pope, and bassist Tony Murray, John recorded another single, "Lady Samantha", and an album, ''Empty Sky''. For their follow-up album, ''Elton John'', Elton John and Bernie Taupin enlisted Gus Dudgeon as producer and Paul Buckmaster as musical arranger. ''Elton John'' was released in April 1970 on DJM Records/Pye Records in the UK and Uni Records in the US, and established the formula for subsequent albums  gospel-chorded rockers and poignant ballads. The first single from the album, "Border Song", made into the US Top 100, peaking at Number 92. The second single, "Your Song", reached number seven in the UK Singles Chart and number eight in the US, becoming John's first hit single as a singer.[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/Elton%20John "Elton John: UK Chart History"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214060116/http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/Elton%20John |date=14 February 2015 }}.

Backed by former Spencer Davis Group drummer Nigel Olsson and bassist Dee Murray, Elton John's first American concert took place at the Troubadour in Los Angeles in August 1970, and was a success.{{sfn|Bernadin|Stanton|1996|p=152}} The concept album ''Tumbleweed Connection'' was released in October 1970, and reached number two in the UK and number five in the US. The live album ''17-11-70'' (''111770'' in the US) was recorded at a live show aired from A&R Studios on WABC-FM in New York City. Sales of the live album were heavily hit in the US when an east-coast bootlegger released the performance several weeks before the official album, including all 60 minutes of the aircast, not just the 40 minutes selected by Dick James Music.

John and Taupin then wrote the soundtrack to the obscure film ''Friends'' and then the album ''Madman Across the Water'', the latter reaching number eight in the US and producing the hit songs, "Levon", and the album's opening track "Tiny Dancer". In 1972, Davey Johnstone joined the Elton John Band on guitar and backing vocals. Released in 1972, ''Honky Chteau'' became John's first US number one album, spending five weeks at the top of the ''Billboard'' 200, and began a streak of seven consecutive US number one albums.[https://rockhall.com/inductees/elton-john/bio/ "Elton John Biography: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161219054137/https://rockhall.com/inductees/elton-john/bio/ |date=19 December 2016 }}.

The pop album ''Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player'' came out at the start of 1973 and reached number one in the UK, the US, Australia among others. The album produced the hits "Crocodile Rock", his first US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 numberone, and "Daniel"; number two US, number four UK. Both the album and "Crocodile Rock" were the first album and single, respectively on the consolidated MCA Records label in the US, replacing MCA's other labels including Uni.

''Goodbye Yellow Brick Road'', released in October 1973, gained instant critical acclaim and topped the chart on both sides of the Atlantic, remaining at number one for two months. It also temporarily established John as a glam rock star. It contained the US number1 "Bennie and the Jets", along with other hits, "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road", "Candle in the Wind", "Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting" and "Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding".

John formed his own label named The Rocket Record Company (distributed in the US by MCA and initially by Island in the UK) and signed acts to it  notably Neil Sedaka ("Bad Blood", on which he sang background vocals) and Kiki Dee  with whom he took a personal interest. Instead of releasing his own records on Rocket, he opted for a {{US$|8 million}} dollar contract offered by MCA. When the contract was signed in 1974, MCA reportedly took out a {{US$|25 million}} insurance policy on John's life.[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/elton-john/news/artists/8828/56076/56108 Elton John | Rolling Stone Music] {{dead link|date=March 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} 2001 encyclopedia.

In 1974, a collaboration with John Lennon took place, resulting in Lennon's appearance on Elton John's single cover of the Beatles' "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", the B-side of which was Lennon's "One Day at a Time." In return, John was featured on "Whatever Gets You thru the Night" on Lennon's ''Walls and Bridges'' album. Later that year in what would be Lennon's last major live performance, the pair performed these two number1 hits along with the Beatles classic "I Saw Her Standing There" at Madison Square Garden in New York. Lennon made the rare stage appearance with John and his band to keep the promise he made that he would appear on stage with him if "Whatever Gets You Thru The Night" became a US number one single.Jeff Woolf, Scott Jennings and James L.

''Caribou'' was released in 1974, becoming John's third number one in the UK, and topping the charts in the US, Canada and Australia. Reportedly recorded in two weeks between live appearances, it featured "The Bitch Is Back" and the orchestrated "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me". "Step into Christmas" was released as a stand-alone single in November 1973, and appears in the album's 1995 remastered re-issue.Stephen Thomas Erlewine [http://www.allmusic.com/album/release/caribou-bonus-tracks-mr0000283518 "Caribou"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115210716/http://www.allmusic.com/album/release/caribou-bonus-tracks-mr0000283518 |date=15 January 2016 }}.

Pete Townshend of the Who asked John to play a character called the "Local Lad" in the film of the rock opera ''Tommy'', and to perform the song "Pinball Wizard". Drawing on power chords, John's version was recorded and used for the movie release in 1975 and the single came out in 1976 (1975 in the US). The song charted at number7 in the UK.

''Billboard''. Retrieved 3 December 2014 Elton John revealed his previously ambiguous personality on the album, with Taupin's lyrics describing their early days as struggling songwriters and musicians in London. The lyrics and accompanying photo booklet are infused with a specific sense of place and time that is otherwise rare in his music. "Someone Saved My Life Tonight" was the hit single from this album and captured an early turning point in Elton John's life. The album's release signalled the end of the Elton John Band, as an unhappy and overworked John dismissed Olsson and Murray, two people who had contributed much of the band's signature sound and who had helped build his live following since the beginning.

According to ''Circus Magazine'', a spokesman for John Reid said the decision was reached mutually via phone while John was in Australia promoting ''Tommy''.Circus Magazine, No 115, August 1975. Vol 2, No 8. K48002 pp1415 She said there was no way Reid could have fired them "because the band are not employed by John Reid , they're employed by Elton John." She went on to say Nigel would be going back to his solo work and Dee would do session work "and possibly cut a solo album".

Davey Johnstone and Ray Cooper were retained, Quaye and Roger Pope returned, and the new bassist was Kenny Passarelli; this rhythm section provided a heavier-sounding backbeat. James Newton Howard joined to arrange in the studio and to play keyboards.

To celebrate five years since he had first appeared at the venue, in 1975 Elton John played a two-night, four-show stand at the Troubadour. With seating limited to under 500 per show, the chance to purchase tickets was determined by a postcard lottery, with each winner allowed two tickets. Everyone who attended the performances received a hardbound "yearbook" of the band's history. That year he also played piano on Kevin Ayers' ''Sweet Deceiver'', and was among the first and few white artists to appear on the black music series ''Soul Train'' on American television. On 9 August 1975, John was named the outstanding rock personality of the year at the first annual Rock Music Awards at ceremonies held in Santa Monica, California.United Press International, "Elton John Named Rock Personality", ''Playground Daily News'', Fort Walton Beach, Florida, Monday 11 August 1975, Volume 30, Number 159, page 14.

In 1976, the live album ''Here and There'' was released in May, followed by the ''Blue Moves'' album in October, which contained the single "Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word". His biggest success in 1976 was "Don't Go Breaking My Heart", a duet with Kiki Dee that topped both the UK and US charts. Finally, in an interview with ''Rolling Stone'' that year, one entitled "Elton's Frank Talk", John stated that he was bisexual.

Besides being the most commercially successful period, 19701976 is also held in the most regard critically. Within only a three-year span, between 1972 and 1975 John saw seven consecutive albums reach number one in the US, something which had not been accomplished before. Of the six Elton John albums to make ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s list of "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time" in 2003, all are from this period, with ''Goodbye Yellow Brick Road'' ranked highest at number91; similarly, the three Elton John albums given five stars by Allmusic (''Tumbleweed Connection'', ''Honky Chteau'', and ''Captain Fantastic'') are all from this period.

During the same period, he made a guest appearance on the popular ''Morecambe and Wise Show'' on the BBC. The two comics spent the episode pointing him in the direction of everywhere except the stage to prevent him singing.

In November 1977, Elton John announced he was retiring from performing; Taupin began collaborating with others. Now producing only one album a year, John issued ''A Single Man'' in 1978, employing a new lyricist, Gary Osborne; the album produced no singles that made the top 20 in the US but the two singles from the album released in the UK, "Part-Time Love" and "Song for Guy", both made the top 20 in the UK with the latter reaching the top 5. In 1979, accompanied by Ray Cooper, Elton John became one of the first Western artists to tour the Soviet Union, as well as one of the first in Israel."The International Who's Who in Popular Music 2002". p. 260. Psychology Press, John returned to the US top ten with "Mama Can't Buy You Love" (number9), a song originally rejected in 1977 by MCA before being released, recorded in 1977 with Philadelphia soul producer Thom Bell. John reported that Thom Bell was the first person to give him voice lessons; Bell encouraged John to sing in a lower register. A disco-influenced album, ''Victim of Love'', was poorly received. In 1979, John and Taupin reunited, though they did not collaborate on a full album until 1983's ''Too Low For Zero''. ''21 at 33'', released the following year, was a significant career boost, aided by his biggest hit in four years, "Little Jeannie" (number3 US), with the lyrics written by Gary Osborne.Ed Hogan [http://www.allmusic.com/song/little-jeannie-mt0033431178 "Little Jeannie"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115210716/http://www.allmusic.com/song/little-jeannie-mt0033431178 |date=15 January 2016 }}.

In 1992, John was inducted into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame. He is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA). His voice was once classed as tenor; it is now baritone. His piano playing is influenced by classical and gospel music.{{sfn|Bernadin|Stanton|1996}} He used Paul Buckmaster to arrange the music on his studio albums during the 1970s. |title=allmusic (((Paul Buckmaster, Biography))) |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=26 May 2010 }}

==Personal life==

===Sexuality and family===

In the late 1960s, Elton John was engaged to be married to his first lover, secretary Linda Woodrow, who is mentioned in the song "Someone Saved My Life Tonight". |accessdate=2 February 2010 |isbn=978-1-55365-200-7 |date=6 September 2007 }} He married German recording engineer Renate Blauel on 14 February 1984, in Darling Point, Sydney, with speculation that the marriage was a cover for his homosexuality. John came out as bisexual in a 1976 interview with ''Rolling Stone'', but after his divorce from Blauel in 1988, he told the magazine he was "comfortable" being gay.Mary Rhiel, David Bruce Suchoff, 

In 1993, he began a relationship with David Furnish, a former advertising executive and now filmmaker originally from Toronto, Ontario, Canada. On 21 December 2005 (the day the Civil Partnership Act came into force), John and Furnish were amongst the first couples in the UK to form a civil partnership, which was held at the Windsor Guildhall. After gay marriage became legal in England in March 2014, John and Furnish married in Windsor, Berkshire, on 21 December 2014, the ninth anniversary of their civil partnership. They have two sons. Their oldest, Zachary Jackson Levon Furnish-John, was born to a surrogate mother on 25 December 2010 in California.Levy, Glen [http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/12/28/welcome-tiny-dancer-elton-john-becomes-a-dad/ Welcome, Tiny Dancer: Elton John Becomes a Dad] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073304/http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/12/28/welcome-tiny-dancer-elton-john-becomes-a-dad/ |date=4 March 2016 }} ''Time''.

Fireside, 2001

In 2010, John was criticised by some Christian groups in the US after describing Jesus as a "compassionate, super-intelligent gay man who understood human problems". William Anthony Donohue, president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights and opponent of gay marriage, responded: "To call Jesus a homosexual is to label him a sexual deviant. But what else would we expect from a man who previously said, 'From my point of view, I would ban religion completely.'"

In 2008, John stated he preferred civil partnerships over marriage for gay people. However, by 2012, John had changed his position and become a staunch supporter of same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom. He was quoted as saying: "There is a world of difference between calling someone your 'partner' and calling them your 'husband'. 'Partner' is a word that should be preserved for people you play tennis with, or work alongside in business. It doesn't come close to describing the love that I have for David, and he for me. In contrast, 'husband' does." In 2014, he claimed Jesus would have been in favour of same-sex marriage.

In 2013, Elton John resisted calls to boycott Russia in protest at the Russian LGBT propaganda law, but told fans at a Moscow concert that the Russian laws were "inhumane and isolating" and he was "deeply saddened and shocked over the current legislation". In a January 2014 interview, Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke of John in an attempt to show that there was no gay discrimination in Russia, stating; "Elton John  he's an extraordinary person, a distinguished musician, and millions of our people sincerely love him, regardless of his sexual orientation." John responded by offering to introduce the President to Russians abused under Russian legislation banning "homosexual propaganda".[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/23/elton-john-vladimir-putin-russian-gay-legislation "Elton John to Putin: I will show you gay people victimised under Russian law"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807045908/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/23/elton-john-vladimir-putin-russian-gay-legislation |date=7 August 2016 }}. ''The Guardian'' (London). Retrieved 13 December 2014 On 24 September 2015, the Associated Press reported that President Putin called John and invited him to meet in the future about LGBT issues in Russia. Putin's call came just a few days after two phone pranksters called Elton John, pretending to be Putin and his spokesman, and causing John to erroneously thank Putin for the call on the singer's Instagram account.

===Wealth===

In April 2009, the ''Sunday Times Rich List'' estimated John's wealth to be 175{{nbsp}}million ({{US$|265 million}}), and ranked him as the 322nd wealthiest person in Britain. John was estimated to have a fortune of 195{{nbsp}}million in the ''Sunday Times Rich List'' of 2011, making him one of the 10 wealthiest people in the British music industry. Aside from his main home Woodside in Old Windsor, Berkshire, John owns residences in Atlanta, Los Angeles, Nice, Holland Park in London, and Venice. John's property in Nice is based on Mon Boron mountain. Elton John is an art collector, and is believed to have one of the largest private photography collections in the world.

In 2000, he admitted to spending 30{{nbsp}}million in just under two yearsan average of 1.5{{nbsp}}million a month. Between January 1996 and September 1997, he spent more than 9.6m on property and 293,000 on flowers. In June 2001 John sold 20 of his cars at Christie's, saying he didn't get the chance to drive them because he was out of the country so often. The sale, which included a 1993 Jaguar XJ220, the most expensive at 234,750, and several Ferraris, Rolls-Royces, and Bentleys, raised nearly 2{{nbsp}}million. In 2003, John sold the contents of his Holland Park homeexpected to fetch 800,000 at Sotheby'sto modernise the decoration and to display some of his contemporary art collection. Every year since 2004, John has opened a shop called "Elton's Closet" in which he sells his second-hand clothes.

By 1975, the pressures of stardom had begun to take a serious toll on him. During "Elton Week" in Los Angeles that year, he had a cocaine overdose."Elton John", Biography Channel, 2005 He also developed the eating disorder bulimia. In a CNN interview with Larry King in 2002, King asked if John knew of Diana, Princess of Wales' eating disorder. John replied, "Yes, I did. We were both bulimic."

Having supported Watford since growing up locally, Elton John became the club's chairman and director in 1976, appointing Graham Taylor as manager and investing large sums of money as the club rose three divisions into the English First Division. The pinnacle of the club's success was finishing runners up in the First Division to Liverpool in 1983 and reaching the FA Cup Final at Wembley Stadium in 1984. He sold the club to Jack Petchey in 1987, but remained president.

In 1997, he re-purchased the club from Petchey and once again became chairman. He stepped down in 2002 when the club needed a full-time chairman although he continued as president of the club. Although no longer the majority shareholder, he still holds a significant financial interest. In June 2005 he held a concert at Watford's home stadium, Vicarage Road, donating the funds to the club, and another concert in May 2010. He has remained friends with a number of high-profile players in football, including Pel and David Beckham.[http://ego.globo.com/famosos/noticia/2012/09/pele-posta-foto-antiga-com-elton-john.html "Pel posta foto antiga com Elton John" ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826172442/http://ego.globo.com/famosos/noticia/2012/09/pele-posta-foto-antiga-com-elton-john.html |date=26 August 2015 }}.

==AIDS Foundation==
{{Main article|Elton John AIDS Foundation}}

John has said that he took risks with unprotected sex during the 1980s and considers himself lucky to have avoided the AIDS epidemic. In 1986, he joined with Dionne Warwick, Gladys Knight and Stevie Wonder to record the single "That's What Friends Are For", with all profits being donated to the American Foundation for AIDS Research. The song won John and the others the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. In April 1990, John performed his 1968 ballad "Skyline Pigeon" at the funeral of Ryan White, a teenage haemophiliac he had befriended.Claude Bernardin (1995).

Elton John became more closely associated with AIDS charities following the deaths of his friends Ryan White in 1990 and Freddie Mercury in 1991, raising large amounts of money and using his public profile to raise awareness of the disease. He founded the Elton John AIDS Foundation in 1992 as a charity to fund programmes for HIV/AIDS prevention, for the elimination of prejudice and discrimination against HIV/AIDS-affected individuals, and for providing services to people living with or at risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. This cause continues to be one of his personal passions. In 1993, he began hosting his annual Academy Award Party, which has become one of the highest-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry, and has raised over {{US$|200million|link=yes}}. In early 2006, John donated the smaller of two bright-red Yamaha pianos from his Las Vegas, Nevada show to auction on eBay to raise public awareness and funds for the foundation.

To raise money for his AIDS charity, he annually hosts a White Tie & Tiara Ball in the grounds of his home in Old Windsor in Berkshire to which many famous celebrities are invited.[http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG8596113/Fashion-royalty-at-Elton-Johns-White-Tie-and-Tiara-Ball-2011.html "Fashion royalty at Elton John's White Tie and Tiara Ball 2011"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115210716/http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG8596113/Fashion-royalty-at-Elton-Johns-White-Tie-and-Tiara-Ball-2011.html |date=15 January 2016 }}. ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London). Retrieved 15 December 2014 On 28 June 2007, the 9th annual White Tie & Tiara Ball took place. The menu consisted of a truffle souffl followed by Surf and Turf (filet mignon with Maine lobster tail) and a giant Knickerbocker glory ice cream. An auction followed the dinner held by Stephen Fry. A Rolls Royce 'Phantom' drophead coupe and a piece of Tracey Emin's artwork both raised 800,000 for the charity fund, with the total amount raised reaching 3.5{{nbsp}}million. Later, John sang "Delilah" with Tom Jones and "Big Spender" with Shirley Bassey. The 2011 guests included Sarah, Duchess of York, Elizabeth Hurley and George Michael (who performed "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me" in a duet with John), and the auction raised 5{{nbsp}}million, adding to the 45{{nbsp}}million the Balls have raised for the Elton John Aids Foundation.

== Elton John Band ==
Since 1970, John's band, of which he is the pianist and lead singer, has been known as the Elton John Band.The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll. p.501. Fireside, 2001Mike Clifford, Pete Frame (1992). The Harmony Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock. p. 88. Harmony Books, 1992 The band has had multiple line-up changes, but Nigel Olsson, Davey Johnstone, and Ray Cooper have been members (albeit non-consecutively) since 1970 (Olsson), 1972 (Johnstone) and 1974 (Cooper). Olsson left the band in 1984 but rejoined in 2000.
Ray Cooper has worked on and off with the Elton John Band because he maintains obligations to other musicians as a session player and sideman as a road-tour percussionist.
