'''Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela''' ({{IPAc-en|m||n||d||l|}}, {{IPA-xh|xoliaa mandla|lang}}; 18 July 1918 5 December 2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist, who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as President of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.


A Xhosa, Mandela was born to the Thembu royal family in Mvezo, British South Africa. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of the Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg. There he became involved in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its Youth League in 1944. After the National Party's white-only government established apartheid, a system of racial segregation that privileged whites, he and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow. Mandela was appointed President of the ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People. He was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial. Influenced by Marxism, he secretly joined the banned South African Communist Party (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant Umkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the government. In 1962, he was arrested for conspiring to overthrow the state and sentenced to life imprisonment in the Rivonia Trial.


Mandela served 27 years in prison, initially on Robben Island, and later in Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. Amid growing domestic and international pressure, and with fears of a racial civil war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk negotiated an end to apartheid and organised the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became President. Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. Economically, Mandela's administration retained its predecessor's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty, and expand healthcare services. Internationally, he acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. He declined a second presidential term and in 1999 was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation.


Mandela was a controversial figure for much of his life. Although critics on the right denounced him as a communist terrorist and those on the radical left deemed him too eager to negotiate and reconcile with apartheid's supporters, he gained international acclaim for his activism. Widely regarded as an icon of democracy and social justice, he received more than 250 honoursincluding the Nobel Peace Prizeand became the subject of a cult of personality. He is held in deep respect within South Africa, where he is often referred to by his Xhosa clan name, '''Madiba''', and described as the "Father of the Nation".

==Early life==
===Childhood: 191834===
Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in Umtata, then part of South Africa's Cape Province.{{sfnm|1a1=Mandela|1y=1994|1p=3|2a1=Boehmer|2y=2008|2p=21|3a1=Smith|3y=2010|3p=17|4a1=Sampson|4y=2011|4p=3}} Given the forename Rolihlahla, a Xhosa term colloquially meaning "troublemaker",{{sfnm|1a1=Benson|1y=1986|1p=16|2a1=Mandela|2y=1994|2p=3|3a1=Smith|3y=2010|3p=17|4a1=Meredith|4y=2010|4p=2|5a1=Sampson|5y=2011|5p=3}} in later years he became known by his clan name, Madiba.{{sfnm|1a1=Mandela|1y=1994|1p=4|2a1=Lodge|2y=2006|2p=2|3a1=Smith|3y=2010|3p=16}} His patrilineal great-grandfather, Ngubengcuka, was king of the Thembu people in the Transkeian Territories of South Africa's modern Eastern Cape province.{{sfnm|1a1=Meer|1y=1988|1p=3|2a1=Guiloineau|2a2=Rowe|2y=2002|2p=23|3a1=Meredith|3y=2010|3p=1}} One of Ngubengcuka's sons, named Mandela, was Nelson's grandfather and the source of his surname.{{sfnm|1a1=Guiloineau|1a2=Rowe|1y=2002|1p=26}} Because Mandela was the king's child by a wife of the Ixhiba clan, a so-called "Left-Hand House", the descendants of his cadet branch of the royal family were morganatic, ineligible to inherit the throne but recognised as hereditary royal councillors.{{sfnm|1a1=Guiloineau|1a2=Rowe|1y=2002|1p=26|2a1=Lodge|2y=2006|2p=1|3a1=Mafela|3y=2008|3pp=102103}}

Nelson Mandela's father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa Mandela, was a local chief and councillor to the monarch; he was appointed to the position in 1915, after his predecessor was accused of corruption by a governing white magistrate.{{sfn|Smith|2010|p=19}} In 1926, Gadla was also sacked for corruption, but Nelson was told that his father had lost his job for standing up to the magistrate's unreasonable demands.{{sfnm|1a1=Mandela|1y=1994|1pp=89|2a1=Smith|2y=2010|2pp=2122|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=4}} A devotee of the god Qamata,{{sfnm|1a1=Mandela|1y=1994|1p=17|2a1=Meredith|2y=2010|2p=1}} Gadla was a polygamist with four wives, four sons and nine daughters, who lived in different villages. Nelson's mother was Gadla's third wife, Nosekeni Fanny, daughter of Nkedama of the Right Hand House and a member of the amaMpemvu clan of the Xhosa.{{sfnm|1a1=Benson|1y=1986|1p=15|2a1=Mandela|2y=1994|2pp=78|3a1=Smith|3y=2010|3pp=16, 2324|4a1=Meredith|4y=2010|4pp=1, 3|5a1=Sampson|5y=2011|5p=4}}

Why this particular name I have no idea.|salign=right |source= Mandela, 1994{{sfn|Mandela|1994|p=19}} }}

Mandela later stated that his early life was dominated by traditional Thembu custom and taboo.{{sfnm|1a1=Mandela|1y=1994|1p=15|2a1=Meredith|2y=2010|2p=3}} He grew up with two sisters in his mother's ''kraal'' in the village of Qunu, where he tended herds as a cattle-boy and spent much time outside with other boys.{{sfnm|1a1=Benson|1y=1986|1p=16|2a1=Mandela|2y=1994|2p=12|3a1=Smith|3y=2010|3pp=2324|4a1=Meredith|4y=2010|4pp=2, 4}} Both his parents were illiterate, but being a devout Christian, his mother sent him to a local Methodist school when he was about seven. Baptised a Methodist, Mandela was given the English forename of "Nelson" by his teacher.{{sfnm|1a1=Mandela|1y=1994|1pp=1819|2a1=Lodge|2y=2006|2p=3|3a1=Smith|3y=2010|3p=24|4a1=Meredith|4y=2010|4pp=2, 45|5a1=Sampson|5y=2011|5pp=5,7|6a1=Forster|6y=2014|6pp=9192}} When Mandela was about nine, his father came to stay at Qunu, where he died of an undiagnosed ailment which Mandela believed to be lung disease.{{sfnm|1a1=Mandela|1y=1994|1p=20|2a1=Lodge|2y=2006|2p=3|3a1=Smith|3y=2010|3p=25|4a1=Meredith|4y=2010|4p=5|5a1=Sampson|5y=2011|5p=7}} Feeling "cut adrift", he later said that he inherited his father's "proud rebelliousness" and "stubborn sense of fairness".{{sfn|Mandela|1994|pp=8, 20}}

Mandela's mother took him to the "Great Place" palace at Mqhekezweni, where he was entrusted to the guardianship of the Thembu regent, Chief Jongintaba Dalindyebo. Although he did not see his mother again for many years, Mandela felt that Jongintaba and his wife Noengland treated him as their own child, raising him alongside their son, Justice, and daughter, Nomafu.{{sfnm|1a1=Benson|1y=1986|1p=17|2a1=Meer|2y=1988|2p=4|3a1=Mandela|3y=1994|3pp=2225|4a1=Lodge|4y=2006|4p=3|5a1=Smith|5y=2010|5pp=2627|6a1=Meredith|6y=2010|6p=5|7a1=Sampson|7y=2011|7pp=79}} As Mandela attended church services every Sunday with his guardians, Christianity became a significant part of his life.{{sfnm|1a1=Meer|1y=1988|1p=7|2a1=Mandela|2y=1994|2pp=2729|3a1=Meredith|3y=2010|3pp=89}} He attended a Methodist mission school located next to the palace, where he studied English, Xhosa, history and geography.{{sfnm|1a1=Meer|1y=1988|1p=7|2a1=Mandela|2y=1994|2p=25|3a1=Smith|3y=2010|3p=27|4a1=Meredith|4y=2010|4p=9}} He developed a love of African history, listening to the tales told by elderly visitors to the palace, and was influenced by the anti-imperialist rhetoric of a visiting chief, Joyi.{{sfnm|1a1=Meer|1y=1988|1pp=1112|2a1=Mandela|2y=1994|2pp=3134|3a1=Lodge|3y=2006|3p=3|4a1=Smith|4y=2010|4p=18|5a1=Meredith|5y=2010|5p=8}} At the time he nevertheless considered the European colonialists not as oppressors but as benefactors who had brought education and other benefits to southern Africa.{{sfnm|1a1=Mandela|1y=1994|1p=43|2a1=Meredith|2y=2010|2p=11}} Aged 16, he, Justice and several other boys travelled to Tyhalarha to undergo the ulwaluko circumcision ritual that symbolically marked their transition from boys to men; afterwards he was given the name ''Dalibunga''.{{sfnm|1a1=Benson|1y=1986|1p=17|2a1=Mandela|2y=1994|2pp=3642|3a1=Lodge|3y=2006|3p=8|4a1=Smith|4y=2010|4pp=2931|5a1=Meredith|5y=2010|5pp=911|6a1=Sampson|6y=2011|6p=14}}

Intending to gain skills needed to become a privy councillor for the Thembu royal house, in 1933 Mandela began his secondary education at Clarkebury Methodist High School in Engcobo, a Western-style institution that was the largest school for black Africans in Thembuland.{{sfnm|1a1=Mandela|1y=1994|1pp=4547|2a1=Smith|2y=2010|2pp=27, 31|3a1=Meredith|3y=2010|3pp=1213|4a1=Sampson|4y=2011|4p=15}} Made to socialise with other students on an equal basis, he claimed that he lost his "stuck up" attitude, becoming best friends with a girl for the first time; he began playing sports and developed his lifelong love of gardening.{{sfn|Mandela|1994|pp=4850}} He completed his Junior Certificate in two years,{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=17}} and in 1937 moved to Healdtown, the Methodist college in Fort Beaufort attended by most Thembu royalty, including Justice.{{sfnm|1a1=Mandela|1y=1994|1p=52|2a1=Smith|2y=2010|2pp=3132|3a1=Meredith|3y=2010|3p=14|4a1=Sampson|4y=2011|4pp=1718}} The headmaster emphasised the superiority of English culture and government, but Mandela became increasingly interested in native African culture, making his first non-Xhosa friend, a speaker of Sotho, and coming under the influence of one of his favourite teachers, a Xhosa who broke taboo by marrying a Sotho.{{sfnm|1a1=Mandela|1y=1994|1pp=5354|2a1=Smith|2y=2010|2p=32|3a1=Meredith|3y=2010|3pp=1415|4a1=Sampson|4y=2011|4pp=1821}} Mandela spent much of his spare time at Healdtown as a long-distance runner and boxer, and in his second year he became a prefect.{{sfnm|1a1=Mandela|1y=1994|1p=56|2a1=Smith|2y=2010|2p=32|3a1=Meredith|3y=2010|3p=15}}

With Jongintaba's backing, in 1939 Mandela began work on a BA degree at the University of Fort Hare, an elite black institution in Alice, Eastern Cape, with around 150 students. There he studied English, anthropology, politics, native administration, and Roman Dutch law in his first year, desiring to become an interpreter or clerk in the Native Affairs Department.{{sfnm|1a1=Mandela|1y=1994|1pp=6265|2a1=Lodge|2y=2006|2p=9|3a1=Smith|3y=2010|3pp=3334|4a1=Meredith|4y=2010|4pp=1518|5a1=Sampson|5y=2011|5pp=21, 25}} Mandela stayed in the Wesley House dormitory, befriending his own kinsman, K.

===Arriving in Johannesburg: 194143===
Returning to Mqhekezweni in December 1940, Mandela found that Jongintaba had arranged marriages for him and Justice; dismayed, they fled to Johannesburg via Queenstown, arriving in April 1941.{{sfnm|1a1=Benson|1y=1986|1p=21|2a1=Mandela|2y=1994|2pp=7376|3a1=Lodge|3y=2006|3p=12|4a1=Smith|4y=2010|4pp=3639|5a1=Meredith|5y=2010|5pp=2022|6a1=Sampson|6y=2011|6pp=2728}} Mandela found work as a night watchman at Crown Mines, his "first sight of South African capitalism in action", but was fired when the ''induna'' (headman) discovered that he was a runaway.{{sfnm|1a1=Benson|1y=1986|1p=23|2a1=Meer|2y=1988|2pp=2526|3a1=Mandela|3y=1994|3pp=8994|4a1=Lodge|4y=2006|4pp=1213|5a1=Smith|5y=2010|5p=40|6a1=Meredith|6y=2010|6pp=2728|7a1=Sampson|7y=2011|7pp=2930}} He stayed with a cousin in George Goch Township, who introduced Mandela to realtor and ANC activist Walter Sisulu.

In the South African general election in 1948, in which only whites were permitted to vote, the Afrikaner-dominated Herenigde Nasionale Party under Daniel Franois Malan took power, soon uniting with the Afrikaner Party to form the National Party.

Mandela opposed the strike because it was multi-racial and not ANC-led, but a majority of black workers took part, resulting in increased police repression and the introduction of the Suppression of Communism Act, 1950, affecting the actions of all protest groups.{{sfnm|1a1=Benson|1y=1986|1pp=3840|2a1=Meer|2y=1988|2pp=4849|3a1=Mandela|3y=1994|3pp=165167|4a1=Smith|4y=2010|4pp=7475|5a1=Meredith|5y=2010|5pp=8183|6a1=Sampson|6y=2011|6pp=6162}} At the ANC national conference of December 1951, he continued arguing against a racially united front, but was outvoted.{{sfnm|1a1=Mandela|1y=1994|1p=176|2a1=Smith|2y=2010|2p=78|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3pp=6364}}

In 1952, the ANC began preparation for a joint Defiance Campaign against apartheid with Indian and communist groups, founding a National Voluntary Board to recruit volunteers.

The charter was adopted at a June 1955 conference in Kliptown; 3,000 delegates attended the event, which was forcibly closed down by police.{{sfnm|1a1=Benson|1y=1986|1pp=6467|2a1=Meer|2y=1988|2pp=7175|3a1=Mandela|3y=1994|3pp=243249|4a1=Lodge|4y=2006|4pp=6566|5a1=Meredith|5y=2010|5pp=129133|6a1=Smith|6y=2010|6pp=118120, 125128|7a1=Sampson|7y=2011|7pp=8795}} The tenets of the Freedom Charter remained important for Mandela, and in 1956 he described it as "an inspiration to the people of South Africa".{{sfn|Meredith|2010|p=134}}

In April 1982, Mandela was transferred to Pollsmoor Prison in Tokai, Cape Town, along with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada, and Raymond Mhlaba; they believed that they were being isolated to remove their influence on younger activists at Robben Island.{{sfnm|1a1=Benson|1y=1986|1p=218|2a1=Lodge|2y=2006|2pp=147149|3a1=Meredith|3y=2010|3p=340|4a1=Sampson|4y=2011|4pp=324325}} Conditions at Pollsmoor were better than at Robben Island, although Mandela missed the camaraderie and scenery of the island.{{sfnm|1a1=Lodge|1y=2006|1p=148|2a1=Meredith|2y=2010|2pp=346347|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3pp=324325}} Getting on well with Pollsmoor's commanding officer, Brigadier Munro, Mandela was permitted to create a roof garden;{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2010|1p=347|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2p=326}} he also read voraciously and corresponded widely, now permitted 52 letters a year.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|pp=329}} He was appointed patron of the multi-racial United Democratic Front (UDF), founded to combat reforms implemented by South African President P.

Following the Bisho massacre, in which 28 ANC supporters and one soldier were shot dead by the Ciskei Defence Force during a protest march, Mandela realised that mass action was leading to further violence and resumed negotiations in September.

Under the Interim Constitution, Inkatha and the National Party were entitled to seats in the government by virtue of winning at least 20 seats. In keeping with earlier agreements, both de Klerk and Thabo Mbeki were given the position of Deputy President.{{sfnm|1a1=Barber|1y=2004|1p=3|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2pp=491492}} Although Mbeki had not been his first choice for the job, Mandela grew to rely heavily on him throughout his presidency, allowing him to shape policy details.{{sfnm|1a1=Barber|1y=2004|1p=87|2a1=Lodge|2y=2006|2p=210|3a1=Meredith|3y=2010|3p=566|4a1=Sampson|4y=2011|4pp=508511}} Moving into the presidential office at Tuynhuys in Cape Town, Mandela allowed de Klerk to retain the presidential residence in the Groote Schuur estate, instead settling into the nearby Westbrooke manor, which he renamed "Genadendal", meaning "Valley of Mercy" in Afrikaans.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2010|1pp=523, 543|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2pp=496497}} Retaining his Houghton home, he also had a house built in his home village of Qunu, which he visited regularly, walking around the area, meeting with locals, and judging tribal disputes.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=502}}

Mandela oversaw the formation of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate crimes committed under apartheid by both the government and the ANC, appointing Tutu as its chair. To prevent the creation of martyrs, the Commission granted individual amnesties in exchange for testimony of crimes committed during the apartheid era. Dedicated in February 1996, it held two years of hearings detailing rapes, torture, bombings, and assassinations, before issuing its final report in October 1998. Both de Klerk and Mbeki appealed to have parts of the report suppressed, though only de Klerk's appeal was successful.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2010|1pp=527, 551564|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2pp=528532}} Mandela praised the Commission's work, stating that it "had helped us move away from the past to concentrate on the present and the future".{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2010|1p=563|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2p=532}}

Of a population of 40 million, around 23 million lacked electricity or adequate sanitation, and 12 million lacked clean water supplies, with 2 million children not in school and a third of the population illiterate. There was 33% unemployment, and just under half of the population lived below the poverty line.{{sfn|Meredith|2010|pp=518520}} Government financial reserves were nearly depleted, with a fifth of the national budget being spent on debt repayment, meaning that the extent of the promised Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) was scaled back, with none of the proposed nationalisation or job creation.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2010|1p=519|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2pp=514515}} In 1996, the RDP was replaced with a new policy, Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR), which maintained South Africa's mixed economy but placed an emphasis on economic growth through a framework of market economics and the encouragement of foreign investment; many in the ANC derided it as a neo-liberal policy that did not address social inequality, no matter how Mandela defended it.{{sfn|Barber|2004|pp=122124, 162}} In adopting this approach, Mandela's government adhered to the "Washington consensus" advocated by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.{{sfnm|1a1=Muthien|1a2=Khosa|1a3=Magubane|1y=2000|1pp=369370|2a1=Meredith|2y=2010|2pp=520521}}

Under Mandela's presidency, welfare spending increased by 13% in 1996/97, 13% in 1997/98, and 7% in 1998/99.{{sfn|Houston|Muthien|2000|p=62}} The government introduced parity in grants for communities, including disability grants, child maintenance grants, and old-age pensions, which had previously been set at different levels for South Africa's different racial groups.{{sfn|Houston|Muthien|2000|p=62}} In 1994, free healthcare was introduced for children under six and pregnant women, a provision extended to all those using primary level public sector health care services in 1996.{{sfnm|1a1=Lodge|1y=2006|1p=205|2a1=Meredith|2y=2010|2p=521}} By the 1999 election, the ANC could boast that due to their policies, 3 million people were connected to telephone lines, 1.5 million children were brought into the education system, 500 clinics were upgraded or constructed, 2 million people were connected to the electricity grid, water access was extended to 3 million people, and 750,000 houses were constructed, housing nearly 3 million people.{{sfn|Herbst|2003|p=312}}

The Land Reform Act 3 of 1996 safeguarded the rights of labour tenants living on farms where they grew crops or grazed livestock. This legislation ensured that such tenants could not be evicted without a court order or if they were over the age of 65.;  Recognising that arms manufacturing was a key industry for the South African economy, Mandela endorsed the trade in weapons but brought in tighter regulations surrounding Armscor to ensure that South African weaponry was not sold to authoritarian regimes.{{sfn|Barber|2004|pp=102194}} Under Mandela's administration, tourism was increasingly promoted, becoming a major sector of the South African economy.{{sfn|Barber|2004|p=130}}

Critics like Edwin Cameron accused Mandela's government of doing little to stem the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the country; by 1999, 10% of South Africa's population were HIV positive. Mandela later admitted that he had personally neglected the issue, in part due to public reticence in discussing issues surrounding sex in South Africa, and that he had instead left the issue for Mbeki to deal with.{{sfnm|1a1=Barber|1y=2004|1pp=135137|2a1=Lodge|2y=2006|2p=219|3a1=Meredith|3y=2010|3pp=571573}}; ;  Mandela also received criticism for failing to sufficiently combat crime; South Africa had one of the world's highest crime rates,{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2010|1p=573|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2pp=510, 56568}} and the activities of international crime syndicates in the country grew significantly throughout the decade.{{sfn|Barber|2004|pp=137138}} Mandela's administration was also perceived as having failed to deal with the problem of corruption.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2010|1pp=544547|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2p=510}}

Further problems were caused by the exodus of thousands of skilled white South Africans from the country, who were escaping the increasing crime rates, higher taxes, and the impact of positive discrimination toward blacks in employment. This exodus resulted in a brain drain, and Mandela criticised those who left.{{sfnm|1a1=Barber|1y=2004|1p=131|2a1=Meredith|2y=2010|2p=573|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3pp=510, 56568}} At the same time, South Africa experienced an influx of millions of illegal migrants from poorer parts of Africa; although public opinion toward these illegal immigrants was generally unfavourable, characterising them as disease-spreading criminals who were a drain on resources, Mandela called on South Africans to embrace them as "brothers and sisters".{{sfn|Barber|2004|p=133}}

Mandela expressed the view that "South Africa's future foreign relations [should] be based on our belief that human rights should be the core of international relations".{{sfnm|1a1=Barber|1y=2004|1p=89|2a1=Lodge|2y=2006|2p=214}} Following the South African example, Mandela encouraged other nations to resolve conflicts through diplomacy and reconciliation.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=555}} In September 1998, Mandela was appointed Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement, who held their annual conference in Durban. He used the event to criticise the "narrow, chauvinistic interests" of the Israeli government in stalling negotiations to end the IsraeliPalestinian conflict and urged India and Pakistan to negotiate to end the Kashmir conflict, for which he was criticised by both Israel and India.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=559}} Inspired by the region's economic boom, Mandela sought greater economic relations with East Asia, in particular with Malaysia, although this was prevented by the 1997 Asian financial crisis.{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=560561}}. He extended diplomatic recognition to the People's Republic of China (PRC), who were growing as an economic force, and initially also to Taiwan, who were already longstanding investors in the South African economy. However, under pressure from the PRC, in November 1996 he cut recognition of Taiwan, and in May 1999 paid an official visit to Beijing.{{sfn|Barber|2004|pp=107108}}

Mandela attracted controversy for his close relationship with Indonesian president Suharto, whose regime was responsible for mass human rights abuses, although on a July 1997 visit to Indonesia he privately urged Suharto to withdraw from the occupation of East Timor.{{sfnm|1a1=Barber|1y=2004|1pp=104105|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2p=560}} He also faced similar criticism from the West for his government's trade links to Syria, Cuba, and Libya,{{sfn|Lodge|2006|p=214}} and for his personal friendships with Castro and Gaddafi.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|pp=562563}} Castro visited in 1998 to widespread popular acclaim, and Mandela met Gaddafi in Libya to award him the Order of Good Hope.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|pp=562563}} When Western governments and media criticised these visits, Mandela lambasted such criticism as having racist undertones,{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=564}} and stated that "the enemies of countries in the West are not our enemies."{{sfn|Lodge|2006|p=214}} Mandela hoped to resolve the long-running dispute between Libya and the US and Britain over bringing to trial the two Libyans, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, who were indicted in November 1991 and accused of sabotaging Pan Am Flight 103. Mandela proposed that they be tried in a third country, which was agreed to by all parties; governed by Scots law, the trial was held at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands in April 1999, and found one of the two men guilty.{{sfnm|1a1=Barber|1y=2004|1p=144|2a1=Lodge|2y=2006|2pp=215216|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3pp=563564}}

Mandela stepped down as ANC President at the party's December 1997 conference.

Zuma's candidacy was challenged by Winnie, whose populist rhetoric had gained her a strong following within the party, although Zuma defeated her in a landslide victory vote at the election.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2010|1p=568|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2pp=537543}}

Mandela's relationship with Machel had intensified; in February 1998, he publicly stated that he was "in love with a remarkable lady", and under pressure from Tutu, who urged him to set an example for young people, he organised a wedding for his 80th birthday, in July that year.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2010|1p=576|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2pp=549551}} The following day, he held a grand party with many foreign dignitaries.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|pp=551552}} Although the 1996 constitution allowed the president to serve two consecutive five-year terms, Mandela had never planned to stand for a second term in office.

Retiring in June 1999, Mandela aimed to lead a quiet family life, divided between Johannesburg and Qunu. Although he set about authoring a sequel to his first autobiography, to be titled ''The Presidential Years'', it was abandoned before publication.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2010|1p=576|2a1=Battersby|2y=2011|2pp=587588}} Mandela found such seclusion difficult and reverted to a busy public life involving daily programme of tasks, meetings with world leaders and celebrities, andwhen in Johannesburgworking with the Nelson Mandela Foundation, founded in 1999 to focus on rural development, school construction, and combating HIV/AIDS.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2010|1p=576|2a1=Battersby|2y=2011|2pp=588589}} Although he had been heavily criticised for failing to do enough to fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic during his presidency, he devoted much of his time to the issue following his retirement, describing it as "a war" that had killed more than "all previous wars"; affiliating himself with the Treatment Action Campaign, he urged Mbeki's government to ensure that HIV-positive South Africans had access to anti-retrovirals.{{sfnm|1a1=Lodge|1y=2006|1pp=219220|2a1=Meredith|2y=2010|2pp=584586|3a1=Battersby|3y=2011|3pp=590591}} Meanwhile, Mandela was successfully treated for prostate cancer in July 2001.{{sfn|Battersby|2011|p=598}}

In 2002, Mandela inaugurated the Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture, and in 2003 the Mandela Rhodes Foundation was created at Rhodes House, University of Oxford, to provide postgraduate scholarships to African students. These projects were followed by the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory and the 46664 campaign against HIV/AIDS.{{sfn|Battersby|2011|pp=589590}} He gave the closing address at the XIII International AIDS Conference in Durban in 2000, and in 2004, spoke at the XV International AIDS Conference in Bangkok, Thailand, calling for greater measures to tackle tuberculosis as well as HIV/AIDS. Mandela publicised AIDS as the cause of his son Makgatho's death in January 2005, to defy the stigma about discussing the disease.

Publicly, Mandela became more vocal in criticising Western powers. He strongly opposed the 1999 NATO intervention in Kosovo and called it an attempt by the world's powerful nations to police the entire world. In 2003, he spoke out against the plans for the US and UK to launch a war in Iraq, describing it as "a tragedy" and lambasting US President George W. Bush and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair for undermining the UN, saying, "All that (Mr. Bush) wants is Iraqi oil". He attacked the US more generally, asserting that it had committed more "unspeakable atrocities" across the world than any other nation, citing the atomic bombing of Japan; this attracted international controversy, although he later improved his relationship with Blair.{{sfn|Battersby|2011|pp=591592}};  Retaining an interest in Libyan-UK relations, he visited Megrahi in Barlinnie prison and spoke out against the conditions of his treatment, referring to them as "psychological persecution".{{sfn|Battersby|2011|p=593}}

He spoke with US Senator Hillary Clinton and President George W. Bush and first met the then-Senator Barack Obama. Mandela also encouraged Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe to resign over growing human rights abuses in the country. When this proved ineffective, he spoke out publicly against Mugabe in 2007, asking him to step down "with residual respect and a modicum of dignity."{{sfn|Battersby|2011|p=594}} That year, Mandela, Machel, and Desmond Tutu convened a group of world leaders in Johannesburg to contribute their wisdom and independent leadership to some of the world's toughest problems.

In a speech marking the event, Mandela called for the rich to help the poor across the world. Throughout Mbeki's presidency, Mandela continued to support the ANC, usually overshadowing Mbeki at any public events that the two attended. Mandela was more at ease with Mbeki's successor, Zuma,{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2010|1p=598|2a1=Battersby|2y=2011|2pp=594597}} although the Nelson Mandela Foundation was upset when his grandson, Mandla Mandela, flew him out to the Eastern Cape to attend a pro-Zuma rally in the midst of a storm in 2009.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2010|1p=598|2a1=Battersby|2y=2011|2pp=594597}}

In 2004, Mandela successfully campaigned for South Africa to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup, declaring that there would be "few better gifts for us" in the year marking a decade since the fall of apartheid.

In February 2011, Mandela was briefly hospitalised with a respiratory infection, attracting international attention,{{sfn|Battersby|2011|p=607}} before being re-admitted for a lung infection and gallstone removal in December 2012.  After a successful medical procedure in early March 2013, his lung infection recurred and he was briefly hospitalised in Pretoria. In June 2013, his lung infection worsened and he was readmitted to a Pretoria hospital in serious condition. The Archbishop of Cape Town Thabo Makgoba visited Mandela at the hospital and prayed with Machel, while Zuma cancelled a trip to Mozambique to visit him the following day. In September 2013, Mandela was discharged from hospital, although his condition remained unstable.

After suffering from a prolonged respiratory infection, Mandela died on 5 December 2013 at the age of 95, at around 20:50 local time (UTC+2) at his home in Houghton, surrounded by his family.

I was first and foremost an African nationalist fighting for our emancipation from minority rule and the right to control our own destiny. But at the same time, South Africa and the African continent were part of the larger world. Our problems, while distinctive and special, were not unique, and a philosophy that placed those problems in an international and historical context of the greater world and the course of history was valuable.

Mandela was a practical politician, rather than an intellectual scholar or political theorist.{{sfnm|1a1=Boehmer|1y=2008|1p=13|2a1=Barnard|2y=2014|2p=14}} According to biographer Tom Lodge, "for Mandela, politics has always been primarily about enacting stories, about making narratives, primarily about morally exemplary conduct, and only secondarily about ideological vision, more about means rather than ends."{{sfn|Lodge|2006|p=ix}} Mandela identified as both an African nationalist, an ideological position he held since joining the ANC,{{sfnm|1a1=Benson|1y=1986|1pp=25, 232|2a1=Lodge|2y=2006|2p=220|3a1=Meredith|3y=2010|3p=241|4a1=Sampson|4y=2011|4pp=37, 584}} and as a socialist.{{sfnm|1a1=Benson|1y=1986|1pp=231232|2a1=Smith|2y=2010|2p=231}}

The historian Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gatsheni described Mandela as a "liberal African nationalistdecolonial humanist",{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|p=907}} while political analyst Raymond Suttner cautioned against labelling Mandela a liberal and stated that Mandela displayed a "hybrid socio-political make-up".{{sfn|Suttner|2007|p=122}} Mandela took political ideas from other thinkersamong them Indian independence leaders like Gandhi and Nehru, African-American civil rights activists, and African nationalists like Nkrumahand applied them to the South African situation. At the same time he rejected other aspects of their thought, such as the anti-white sentiment of many African nationalists.{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|p=109}} In doing so he synthesized both counter-cultural and hegemonic views, for instance by drawing upon ideas from the then-dominant Afrikaner nationalism in promoting his anti-apartheid vision.{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|p=102}}

His political development was strongly influenced by his legal training and practice, in particular his hope to achieve change not through violence but through "legal revolution".{{sfn|Lodge|2006|p=viii}} Over the course of his life, he began by advocating a path of non-violence, later embracing violence, and then adopting a non-violent approach to negotiation and reconciliation.{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|p=107}} When endorsing violence, he did so because he saw no alternative, and was always pragmatic about it, perceiving it as a means to get his opponent to the negotiating table.{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|pp=105, 108}} He sought to target symbols of white supremacy and racist oppression rather than white people as individuals, and was anxious not to inaugurate a race war in South Africa.{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|p=914}} This willingness to use violence distinguishes Mandela from the ideology of Gandhism, with which some commentators have sought to associate him.{{sfn|Suttner|2007|pp=119120}}

===Democracy===

Although he presented himself in an autocratic manner in several speeches, Mandela was a devout believer in democracy and abided by majority decisions even when deeply disagreeing with them.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=433}} He had exhibited a commitment to the values of democracy and human rights since at least the 1960s.{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|pp=906907}} He held a conviction that "inclusivity, accountability and freedom of speech" were the fundamentals of democracy,{{sfn|Battersby|2011|p=605}} and was driven by a belief in natural and human rights.{{sfn|Kalumba|1995|p=162}} Suttner argued that there were "two modes of leadership" that Mandela adopted. On one side he adhered to ideas about collective leadership, although on the other believed that there were scenarios in which a leader had to be decisive and act without consultation to achieve a particular objective.{{sfn|Suttner|2007|pp=113114}}

According to Lodge, Mandela's political thought reflected tensions between his support for liberal democracy and pre-colonial African forms of consensus decision making.{{sfn|Lodge|2006|p=xi}} He was an admirer of British-style parliamentary democracy,{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|p=907}} stating that "I regard the British Parliament as the most democratic institution in the world, and the independence and impartiality of its judiciary never fail to arouse my admiration."{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|p=907}} In this he has been described as being committed to "the Euro-North American modernist project of emancipation", something which distinguishes him from other African nationalist and socialist leaders like Nyerere who were concerned about embracing styles of democratic governance that were Western, rather than African, in origin.{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|p=907}} Mandela nevertheless also expressed admiration for what he deemed to be indigenous forms of democracy, describing Xhosa traditional society's mode of governance as "democracy in its purest form".{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|p=907}} He also spoke of an influential African ethical tenet, Ubuntu, which was a Ngnuni term meaning "A person is a person through other persons" or "I am because we are."{{sfn|Oppenheim|2012|pp=369370}}

Mandela advocated the ultimate establishment of a classless society,{{sfnm|1a1=Benson|1y=1986|1pp=231, 232|2a1=Ellis|2y=2016|2p=7}} with Sampson describing him as being "openly opposed to capitalism, private land-ownership and the power of big money".{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=298}} Mandela was influenced by Marxism, and during the revolution he advocated scientific socialism.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=282}} He denied being a communist at the Treason Trial,{{sfnm|1a1=Mandela|1y=1994|1p=365|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2pp=135138}} and maintained this stance both when later talking to journalists,{{sfn|Benson|1986|p=232}} and in his autobiography.{{sfn|Ellis|2016|p=18}} According to the sociologist Craig Soudien, "sympathetic as Mandela was to socialism, a communist he was not."{{sfn|Soudien|2015|p=361}} Conversely, the biographer David Jones Smith stated that Mandela "embraced communism and communists" in the late 1950s and early 1960s,{{sfn|Smith|2010|pp=217218}} while the historian Stephen Ellis commented that Mandela had assimilated much of the Marxist-Leninist ideology by 1960.{{sfn|Ellis|2016|p=7}}

Ellis also found evidence that Mandela had been an active member of the South African Communist Party during the late 1950s and early 1960s,{{sfn|Ellis|2011|pp=667668}} something that was confirmed after his death by both the ANC and the SACP, the latter of which claimed that he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee. His membership had been hidden by the ANC, aware that knowledge of Mandela's former SACP involvement might have been detrimental to his attempts to attract support from Western countries.{{sfn|Ellis|2016|p=17}} Mandela's view of these Western governments differed from those of Marxist-Leninists, for he did not believe that they were anti-democratic or reactionary and remained committed to democratic systems of governance.{{sfn|Smith|2010|p=231}}

The 1955 Freedom Charter, which Mandela had helped create, called for the nationalisation of banks, gold mines and land, to ensure equal distribution of wealth.{{sfn|Kalumba|1995|pp=164165}} Despite these beliefs, Mandela initiated a programme of privatisation during his presidency in line with trends in other countries of the time.{{sfn|Freund|2014|p=294}} It has been repeatedly suggested that Mandela would have preferred to develop a social democratic economy in South Africa but that this was not feasible as a result of the international political and economic situation during the early 1990s.{{sfn|Freund|2014|p=294}} This decision was in part influenced by the fall of the socialist states in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc during the early 1990s.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|pp=433435}}

==Personality and personal life==

Mandela was widely considered a charismatic leader,{{sfnm|1a1=Glad|1a2=Blanton|1y=1997|1p=570|2a1=Read|2y=2010|2p=326}} described by biographer Mary Benson as "a born mass leader who could not help magnetizing people".{{sfn|Benson|1986|p=51}} He was highly image conscious and throughout his life always sought out fine quality clothes, with many commentators believing that he carried himself in a regal manner.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|pp=432, 554}} His aristocratic heritage was repeatedly emphasised by supporters, thus contributing to his "charismatic power".{{sfn|Lodge|2006|p=2}} While living in Johannesburg in the 1950s, he cultivated the image of the "African gentleman", having "the pressed clothes, correct manners, and modulated public speech" associated with such a position.{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|p=111}} In doing so, Lodge argued that Mandela became "one of the first media politicians [...] embodying a glamour and a style that projected ''visually'' a brave new African world of modernity and freedom".{{sfn|Lodge|2006|p=ix}} Mandela was known to change his clothes several times a day and after assuming the presidency he became so associated with highly coloured Batik shirts that they came to be known as "Madiba shirts".{{sfnm|1a1=Boehmer|1y=2008|1p=133|2a1=Meredith|2y=2010|2p=495|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=503}}

For political scientists Betty Glad and Robert Blanton, Mandela was an "exceptionally intelligent, shrewd, and loyal leader".{{sfn|Glad|Blanton|1997|p=577}} His official biographer, Anthony Sampson, commented that he was a "master of imagery and performance", excelling at presenting himself well in press photographs and producing sound bites.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|pp=582583}} His public speeches were presented in a formal, stiff manner, and often consisted of clichd set phrases.{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|pp=128, 134}} He typically spoke slowly, and carefully chose his words.{{sfn|Glad|Blanton|1997|p=576}} Although he was not considered a great orator, his speeches conveyed "his personal commitment, charm and humour".{{sfn|Barber|2004|p=87}}

Mandela was a private person who often concealed his emotions and confided in very few people.{{sfnm|1a1=Suttner|1y=2007|1p=119|2a1=Meredith|2y=2010|2pp=xvxvi}} Privately, he lived an austere life, refusing to drink alcohol or smoke, and even as President made his own bed.{{sfn|Meredith|2010|p=xvi}} Renowned for his mischievous sense of humour,{{sfn|Battersby|2011|p=599}} he was known for being both stubborn and loyal,{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2010|1p=xvi|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2p=583}} and at times exhibited a quick temper.{{sfnm|1a1=Glad|1a2=Blanton|1y=1997|1p=582|2a1=Meredith|2y=2010|2p=xvi}} He was typically friendly and welcoming, and appeared relaxed in conversation with everyone, including his opponents.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|pp=411, 498}} A self-described Anglophile, he claimed to have lived by the "trappings of British style and manners".{{sfnm|1a1=Glad|1a2=Blanton|1y=1997|1p=581|2a1=Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2y=2014|2p=907}} Constantly polite and courteous, he was attentive to all, irrespective of their age or status, and often talked to children or servants.{{sfn|Meredith|2010|pp=xvi, 482483}} He was known for his ability to find common ground with very different communities.{{sfn|Barnard|2014|pp=56}} In later life, he always looked for the best in people, even defending political opponents to his allies, who sometimes thought him too trusting of others.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|pp=431, 582}} He was fond of Indian cuisine,{{sfn|Meredith|2010|p=164}} and had a lifelong interest in archaeology{{sfn|Meer|1988|p=189}} and boxing.{{sfn|Lodge|2006|p=29}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=The significance of Mandela can be considered in two related ways. First, he has provided through his personal presence as a benign and honest conviction politician, skilled at exerting power but not obsessed with it to the point of view of excluding principles, a man who struggled to display respect to all... Second, in so doing he was able to be a hero and a symbol to an array of otherwise unlikely mates through his ability, like all brilliant nationalist politicians, to speak to very different audiences effectively at once.|salign=right |source= Bill Freund, academic{{sfn|Freund|2014|p=295}} }}

He was raised in the Methodist denomination of Christianity; the Methodist Church of Southern Africa claimed that he retained his allegiance to them throughout his life.{{sfn|Forster|2014|p=89}} On analysing Mandela's writings, the theologian Dion Forster described him as a Christian humanist, although added that his thought relied to a greater extent on the Southern African concept of Ubuntu than on Christian theology.{{sfn|Forster|2014|pp=106107}} According to Sampson, Mandela never had "a strong religious faith" however,{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=65}} while Boehmer stated that Mandela's religious belief was "never robust".{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|p=86}}

Mandela was very self-conscious about being a man and regularly made references to manhood.{{sfn|Suttner|2014|p=342}} He was heterosexual,{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|p=142}} and biographer Fatima Meer said that he was "easily tempted" by women.{{sfn|Meer|1988|p=78}} Another biographer, Martin Meredith, characterised him as being "by nature a romantic", highlighting that he had relationships with various women.{{sfn|Meredith|2010|p=21}} Mandela was married three times, fathered six children, and had seventeen grandchildren and at least seventeen great-grandchildren. He could be stern and demanding of his children, although he was more affectionate with his grandchildren.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2010|1p=481|2a1=Smith|2y=2010|2p=147|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=246}} His first marriage was to Evelyn Ntoko Mase in October 1944;{{sfnm|1a1=Mandela|1y=1994|1pp=144, 148149|2a1=Smith|2y=2010|2pp=5962|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=36}} they divorced in March 1958 under the multiple strains of his adultery and constant absences, devotion to revolutionary agitation, and the fact that she was a Jehovah's Witness, a religion requiring political neutrality.{{sfnm|1a1=Mandela|1y=1994|1p=296|2a1=Smith|2y=2010|2pp=102104|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=110}} Mandela's second wife was the social worker Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, whom he married in June 1958,{{sfnm|1a1=Benson|1y=1986|1pp=7476|2a1=Meer|2y=1988|2p=93|3a1=Mandela|3y=1994|3pp=306311|4a1=Meredith|4y=2010|4pp=144149|5a1=Smith|5y=2010|5pp=104, 132145|6a1=Sampson|6y=2011|6pp=110113}} although they divorced in March 1996.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2010|1pp=539542|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2p=500}} Mandela married his third wife, Graa Machel, on his 80th birthday in July 1998.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2010|1pp=xvii, 576|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2pp=549551}}

==Reception and legacy==
thumb|Flowers left at the [[Statue of Nelson Mandela, Parliament Square|Mandela statue in London's Parliament Square following his death]]
By the time of his death, within South Africa Mandela was widely considered both "the father of the nation" and "the founding father of democracy".{{sfn|Meredith|2010|p=565}} Outside of South Africa, he was a "global icon",{{sfnm|1a1=Barnard|1y=2014|1pp=1, 2|2a1=Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2y=2014|2p=906}} with the scholar of South African studies Rita Barnard describing him as "one of the most revered figures of our time".{{sfn|Barnard|2014|pp=1, 2}} One biographer considered him "a modern democratic hero",{{sfn|Lodge|2006|p=225}} while his popularity resulted in a cult of personality building up around him.{{sfn|Barnard|2014|p=2}} Some have portrayed Mandela in messianic terms,{{sfn|Suttner|2007|pp=125126}} in contrast to his own statement that "I was not a messiah, but an ordinary man who had become a leader because of extraordinary circumstances."{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2010|1p=599|2a1=Barnard|2y=2014|2p=4}} He is often cited alongside Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. as one of the 20th century's exemplary anti-racist and anti-colonial leaders.{{sfnm|1a1=Boehmer|1y=2008|1p=82|2a1=Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2y=2014|2p=918}} Boehmer described him as "a totem of the totemic values of our age: toleration and liberal democracy"{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|p=16}} and "a universal symbol of social justice".{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|p=1}}

Mandela's international fame had emerged during his incarceration in the 1980s, when he became the world's most famous prisoner, a symbol of the anti-apartheid cause, and an icon for millions who embraced the ideal of human equality.{{sfn|Barnard|2014|p=1}} In 1986, Mandela's biographer characterised him as "the embodiment of the struggle for liberation" in South Africa.{{sfn|Benson|1986|p=13}} Meredith stated that in becoming "a potent symbol of resistance" to apartheid during the 1980s, he had gained "mythical status" internationally.{{sfn|Meredith|2010|p=xv}} Sampson commented that even during his life, this myth had become "so powerful that it blurs the realities", converting Mandela into "a secular saint".{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=xxvi}}  Within a decade of the end of his Presidency, Mandela's era was being widely thought of as "a golden age of hope and harmony",{{sfn|Meredith|2010|p=599}} with much nostalgia being expressed for it.{{sfn|Freund|2014|p=296}} His name was often invoked by those criticising his successors like Mbeki and Zuma.{{sfn|Mangcu|2013|p=101}} Across the world, Mandela earned international acclaim for his activism in overcoming apartheid and fostering racial reconciliation,{{sfn|Meredith|2010|p=xvi}} coming to be viewed as "a moral authority" with a great "concern for truth".{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=582}} Mandela's iconic status has been blamed for concealing the complexities of his life.{{sfn|Suttner|2016|p=17}}

Mandela generated controversy throughout his career as an activist and politician,{{sfn|Barnard|2014|p=2}} having detractors on both the right and the radical left.{{sfn|Boehmer|2008|p=173}} During the 1980s, Mandela was widely labelled a terrorist by prominent political figures in the Western world for his embrace of political violence.{{sfn|Boehmer|2005|p=46}} According to Thatcher, for instance, the ANC was "a typical terrorist organisation".{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=360}} The US government's State and Defense departments officially designated the ANC as a terrorist organisation, resulting in Mandela remaining on their terrorism watch-list until 2008. On the left, some voices in the ANCamong them Frank B. Wilderson IIIaccused him of selling out for agreeing to enter negotiations with the apartheid government and for not implementing the reforms of the Freedom Charter during his Presidency.{{sfnm|1a1=Barnard|1y=2014|1p=2|2a1=Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2y=2014|2p=918}} According to Barnard, "there is also a sense in which his chiefly bearing and mode of conduct, the very respect and authority he accrued in representing his nation in his own person, went against the spirit of democracy",{{sfn|Barnard|2014|p=2}} and concerns were similarly expressed that he placed his own status and celebrity above the transformation of his country.{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2014|p=918}} His government would be criticised for its failure to deal with both the HIV/AIDS pandemic and the high levels of poverty in South Africa.{{sfn|Barnard|2014|p=2}} Mandela was also criticised for his friendship with political leaders such as Castro, Gaddafi, and Suhartodeemed dictators by criticsas well as his refusal to condemn their governments' human rights violations.

===Biographies and popular media===

The first biography of Mandela was authored by Mary Benson, based on brief interviews with him that she had conducted in the 1960s.{{sfn|Lodge|2006|p=8}} Two authorised biographies were later produced by friends of Mandela.{{sfn|Lodge|2006|p=vii}} The first was Fatima Meer's ''Higher Than Hope'', which was heavily influenced by Winnie and thus placed great emphasis on Mandela's family.{{sfn|Lodge|2006|pp=vii, 1314}} The second was Anthony Sampson's ''Mandela'', published in 1999.{{sfn|Lodge|2006|p=vii}} Other biographies included Martin Meredith's ''Mandela'', first published in 1997, and Tom Lodge's ''Mandela'', brought out in 2006.{{sfn|Lodge|2006|p=vii}}

Since the late 1980s, Mandela's image began to appear on a proliferation of items, among them "photographs, paintings, drawings, statues, public murals, buttons, t-shirts, refrigerator magnets, and more",{{sfn|Nelson|2014|p=130}} items that have been characterised as "Mandela kitsch".{{sfn|Nelson|2014|p=138}} In the 1980s he was the subject of several songs, such as  The Special AKA's "Free Nelson Mandela" and Hugh Masekela's "Bring Him Back Home (Nelson Mandela)", which helped to bring awareness of his imprisonment to an international audience. Following his death, there appeared many internet memes featuring images of Mandela with his inspirational quotes superimposed onto them.{{sfn|Nelson|2014|p=130}} Mandela has also been depicted in films on multiple occasions.{{sfn|Bromley|2014|p=41}} Some of these, such as the 2013 feature film ''Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom'' and the 1996 documentary ''Mandela'', have focused on covering his long life, whereas others, such as the 2009 feature film ''Invictus'' and the 2010 documentary ''The 16th Man'', have focused on specific events in his life.{{sfn|Bromley|2014|p=41}} It has been argued that in ''Invictus'' and other films, "the American film industry" has played a significant part in "the crafting of Mandela's global image".{{sfn|Lukhele|2012|p=289}}
