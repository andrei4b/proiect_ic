'''Willard Carroll  Smith Jr.'''  (born September 25, 1968) is an American actor, producer, rapper, comedian, and songwriter. In April 2007, ''Newsweek'' called him "the most powerful actor in Hollywood". Smith has been nominated for five Golden Globe Awards and two Academy Awards, and has won four Grammy Awards.

In the late 1980s, Smith achieved modest fame as a rapper under the name The Fresh Prince. In 1990, his popularity increased dramatically when he starred in the NBC television series ''The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air'', which ran for six seasons until 1996. After the series ended, Smith transitioned from television to film, and has gone on to star in numerous blockbuster films. He is the only actor to have eight consecutive films gross over $100 million in the domestic box office, eleven consecutive films gross over $150 million internationally, and eight consecutive films in which he starred, open at the number one spot in the domestic box office tally.

Smith has been ranked as the most bankable star worldwide by ''Forbes''. As of 2014, 17 of the 21 films in which he has had leading roles have accumulated worldwide gross earnings of over $100 million each, five taking in over $500 million each in global box office receipts. As of 2016, his films have grossed $7.5 billion at the global box office. 
For his performances as boxer Muhammad Ali in ''Ali'' (2001) and stockbroker Chris Gardner in ''The Pursuit of Happyness'' (2006), Smith received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor.

==Early life==
Smith was born on September 25, 1968 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Caroline (Bright), a Philadelphia school board administrator, and Willard Carroll Smith Sr., U.S. Air Force veteran and refrigeration engineer. He grew up in West Philadelphia's Wynnefield neighborhood, and was raised Baptist. He has three siblings, sister Pamela, who is four years older, and twins Harry and Ellen, who are three years younger. Smith attended Our Lady of Lourdes, a private Catholic elementary school in Philadelphia. His parents separated when he was 13, but did not actually divorce until around 2000.

Smith attended Overbrook High School. While it has been widely reported that Smith turned down a scholarship to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), he never applied to college because he "wanted to rap."  Smith says he was admitted to a "pre-engineering [summer] program" at MIT for high school students, but he did not attend. According to Smith, "My mother, who worked for the School Board of Philadelphia, had a friend who was the admissions officer at MIT. I had pretty high SAT scores and they needed black kids, so I probably could have gotten in. But I had no intention of going to college."

==Career==

===19851992: The Fresh Prince===
thumb|right|Smith at the Emmy Awards in 1993

Smith started as the MC of the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince, with his childhood friend Jeffrey "DJ Jazzy Jeff" Townes as turntablist and producer.Stated on ''Inside the Actors Studio'', 2002 Townes and Smith were introduced to each other by chance in 1985, as Townes was performing at a house party only a few doors down from Smith's residence, and he was missing his hype man. Smith decided to fill in. They both felt strong chemistry, and Townes was upset when his hype man finally made it to the party.

Soon after, the two decided to join forces. Smith enlisted a friend to join as the beatboxer of the group, Clarence Holmes (Ready Rock C), making them a trio. Philadelphia-based Word Up Records released their first single in late 1985 to 1986 when A&R man Paul Oakenfold[http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Paul-Oakenfold-Biography/887820CD0D81734B48256C3200095A8C Paul Oakenfold] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429072412/http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Paul-Oakenfold-Biography/887820CD0D81734B48256C3200095A8C |date=2008-04-29 }} introduced them to Word Up with their single "Girls Ain't Nothing but Trouble," a tale of funny misadventures that landed Smith and his former DJ and rap partner Mark Forrest (Lord Supreme) in trouble.[https://web.archive.org/web/20071201090331/http://members.aol.com/ProfQuater/Jazzy.html Champion Records] The song sampled the theme song of "I Dream of Jeannie." Smith became known for light-hearted story-telling raps and capable, though profanity-free, "battle" rhymes. The single became a hit a month before Smith graduated from high school.  

Based on this success, the duo were brought to the attention of Jive Records and Russell Simmons. The duo's first album, ''Rock the House'', which was first released on Word Up in 1986 debuted on Jive in  March of 1987. The group received the first Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance in 1989 for "Parents Just Don't Understand" (1988), though their most successful single was "Summertime" (1991), which earned the group their second Grammy and peaked at number 4 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Smith and Townes are still friends and claim that they never split up, having made songs under Smith's solo performer credit.

Smith spent money freely around 1988 and 1989 and underpaid his income taxes. The Internal Revenue Service eventually assessed a $2.8 million tax debt against Smith, took many of his possessions, and garnished his income. 
Smith was nearly bankrupt in 1990, when the NBC television network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom, ''The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air'', around him. The show was successful and began his acting career. Smith set for himself the goal of becoming "the biggest movie star in the world", studying box office successes' common characteristics.

===19932006: Solo music and film beginnings===
Smith's first major roles were in the drama ''Six Degrees of Separation'' (1993) and the action film ''Bad Boys'' (1995) in which he starred opposite Martin Lawrence. The latter film was commercially successful, grossing $141,407,024 worldwide  $65,807,024 in North America and $75,600,000 overseas. However, critical reception was generally mixed. In 1996, Smith starred as part of an ensemble cast in Roland Emmerich's ''Independence Day''. The film was a massive blockbuster, becoming the second highest-grossing film in history at the time and establishing Smith as a prime box office draw. 

In the summer of 1997 he starred alongside Tommy Lee Jones in the summer hit ''Men in Black'' playing Agent J. The film was released on July 2, 1997, by Columbia Pictures, and grossed over $589.3 million worldwide against a $90million budget, becoming the year's third highest-grossing film, with an estimated 54,616,700 tickets sold in the US. It received worldwide acclaim, with critics highly praising its witty, sophisticated humor, as well as Jones and Smith's performances.

During the summer of 1997, Smith also began his solo career with the release of "Men in Black", the theme song for the film of the same name, which topped singles charts in several regions across the world, including the UK. "Men in Black" (and second single "Just Cruisin'") was later included on Smith's debut solo album ''Big Willie Style'', which reached the top ten of the US ''Billboard'' 200 and was certified nine times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The third single from the album, "Gettin' Jiggy wit It", became Smith's first ''Billboard'' Hot 100 number one when it was released in 1998.

In 1998, Smith starred with Gene Hackman in ''Enemy of the State''. The following year he turned down the role of Neo in ''The Matrix'' in favor of ''Wild Wild West'' (1999). Despite the disappointment of ''Wild Wild West'', Smith has said that he harbors no regrets about his decision, asserting that Keanu Reeves's performance as Neo was superior to what Smith himself would have achieved, although in interviews subsequent to the release of ''Wild Wild West'' he stated that he "made a mistake on ''Wild Wild West''. That could have been better."O'Toole, Lesley. "Will Smith: The Total Film Interview", ''Total Film'', February 2009, Issue 151, pp. 120-125, Future Publishing Ltd., London, England.

Smith's second album was again supported by the release of a film theme song as the lead single: "Wild Wild West", featuring Dru Hill and Kool Moe Dee, topped the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and was certified gold by the RIAA. The album in question, ''Willennium'', reached number five on the ''Billboard'' 200 and was certified double platinum by the RIAA. "Will 2K", the second single from the album, reached number 25 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Before the end of 1999, a video album was released featuring Smith's seven music videos released to date, which reached number 25 on the UK Music Video Chart. The same year, the rapper was also featured on ''The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air'' co-star Tatyana Ali's single "Boy You Knock Me Out", which reached number three on the UK Singles Chart and topped the UK R&B Singles Chart.

Smith portrayed heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali in the 2001 biopic ''Ali''. For his performance he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor Motion Picture Drama.
In 2002, following a four-year musical hiatus, Smith returned with his third album ''Born to Reign'', which reached number 13 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and was certified gold by the RIAA. The album's lead single was ''Men in Black II'' theme song "Black Suits Comin' (Nod Ya Head)", which reached number three on the UK Singles Chart. Later in the year, Smith's first compilation album ''Greatest Hits'' was released, featuring songs from his three solo albums as well as those produced with DJ Jazzy Jeff. 

2003 saw Smith return for Bad Boys II, the sequel to the 1995 film ''Bad Boys'' and the second installment in the ''Bad Boys'' series, the film follows detectives Burnett and Lowrey investigating the flow of ecstasy into Miami. Despite receiving generally negative reviews, the film was a box office success, grossing $270 million worldwide.

Smith's latest album ''Lost and Found'' was released in 2005, peaking at number six on the ''Billboard'' 200. Lead single "Switch" reached the top ten of both the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. In 2005, Smith was entered into the ''Guinness Book of World Records'' for attending three premieres in a 24-hour time span.

===20062013: Leading man status===

On December 10, 2007, Smith was honored at Grauman's Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. Smith left an imprint of his hands and feet outside the world-renowned theater in front of many fans. Later that month, Smith starred in the film ''I Am Legend'', released December 14, 2007. Alongside marginally positive reviews, its opening was the largest ever for a film released in the United States during December. Smith himself has said that he considers the film to be "aggressively unique".[http://www.stv.tv/content/out/film/videointerviews/display.html?id=opencms:/out/films/video_interviews/will_smith_i_am_legend_interview Will Smith: He is a legend] video interview with stv.tv, December 2007  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010221635/http://www.stv.tv/content/out/film/videointerviews/display.html?id=opencms%3A%2Fout%2Ffilms%2Fvideo_interviews%2Fwill_smith_i_am_legend_interview |date=October 10, 2008 }} A reviewer said that the film's commercial success "cemented [Smith's] standing as the number one box office draw in Hollywood." On December 1, 2008, ''TV Guide'' reported that Smith was selected as one of America's top ten most fascinating people of 2008 for a Barbara Walters ABC special that aired on December 4, 2008.[http://www.tvguide.com/News/Barbara-Walters-Special-1000398.aspx Barbara Walters Gets Up Close with 2008's Most Fascinating People]", ''TV Guide''. December 1, 2008. Retrieved on December 3, 2008.

On August 19, 2011, it was announced that Smith had returned to the studio with producer La Mar Edwards to work on his fifth studio album. 

''Men in Black III'' opened on May 25, 2012 with Smith again reprising his role as Agent J. This was his first major starring role in four years. Smith worked with Barry Sonnenfeld during the film's helming who commented that Smith was an exception in being an actor who was successful not for the size of his head, but that his "ego" compensated for it. After the release of ''Men in Black III'', Smith was content with ending his work with the franchise: "I think three is enough for me. Three of anything is enough for me. We'll look at it and we'll consider it, but it feels like that it might be time to let someone else do that." ''Men in Black 3'' was released ten years after release of ''Men in Black II'' (2002), and grossed over $624million worldwide.[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/men_in_black_iii/ "Men in Black III"] Rotten Tomatoes Unadjusted for inflation, it is the highest-grossing film in the series.

In 2013 Smith starred in ''After Earth'' with his son Jaden. The film was a disappointment at the domestic box office and was panned critically.  Calling the film "the most painful failure in my career." Smith ended up taking a year and a half break as a result. 

===2015  present===
Smith starred opposite Margot Robbie in the romance drama ''Focus''. He played Nicky Spurgeon, a veteran con artist who takes a young, attractive woman under his wing. ''Focus'' was released on February 27, 2015. Smith was set to star in the sci-fi thriller ''Brilliance'', an adaptation of Marcus Sakey's novel of the same name scripted by ''Jurassic Park'' writer David Koepp, but he left the project to work on the Ridley Scott-produced sports drama ''Concussion''.

In ''Concussion'', Smith played Dr. Bennet Omalu of the Brain Injury Research Institute, the first to discover chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Smith reported he had doubts about the film early in the production, saying, "some of my happiest memories are of watching my son catch and throw a football. I didnt want to be the guy who did a movie saying football could be dangerous." These views subsided when he met Omalu, whose words about American ideals resonated with Smith. Smith's performance was praised for being "sensitive [and] understated".

In 2016, Smith played Deadshot in the supervillain team-up action film ''Suicide Squad''. Smith's participation in the film meant choosing it over a role in  ''Independence Day: Resurgence'', which he said would be like "clinging and clawing backwards." Later that year, Smith starred in director David Frankel's drama ''Collateral Beauty'', playing a New York advertising executive who succumbs to a deep depression after a personal tragedy. Weeks after signing Smith onto the film, his father was diagnosed with cancer, from which he died in 2016. As part of his role required him to read about religion and the afterlife, he was brought closer to the elder Smith, calling the experience "a beautiful way to prepare for a movie and an even more majestic way to say goodbye to my father."

His film, ''Bright'' was distributed via Netflix on December 22, 2017. An urban fantasy, it was the most expensive film for Netflix to date. Smith collaborated with his director from ''Suicide Squad'', David Ayer.http://www.vulture.com/2017/07/will-smith-explains-why-he-made-bright-for-netflix.html That month, Smith launched his own YouTube channel, Which as of May 2018 has 1.8 million subscribers and 30.8 million total views.The video titled "Facing my Biggest fear" (Uploaded March 2018) is his biggest YouTube video so far, with 2.1 Million views.{{fact|date=May 2018}}  Also in 2017 Smith released the song "''Get Lit''" a collaboration between him and his former group mate Jazzy Jeff.
