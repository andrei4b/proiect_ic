'''Dwayne Douglas Johnson''' (born May 2, 1972), also known by his ring name '''The Rock''', is an American actor, producer, and semi-retired professional wrestler.

Johnson was a college football player for the University of Miami, where he won a national championship on the 1991 Miami Hurricanes team. After being cut from the Calgary Stampeders of CFL two months into the 1995 season, he began training for a career in professional wrestling, following in the footsteps of various family members, including his grandfather Peter Maivia and his father, Rocky Johnson, from whom he inherited Canadian citizenship in 2009.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, Johnson gained mainstream fame in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) from 1996 to 2004 and was the first third-generation wrestler in the company's history. He returned to WWE part-time from 201113 and continues to make sporadic appearances. He is an eight time WWF/WWE Champion, two time WCW/World Champion, two time WWF Intercontinental Champion and a five time WWF Tag Team Champion. He is the sixth Triple Crown Champion in WWE and won the 2000 Royal Rumble. His autobiography ''The Rock Says...'' debuted at No. 1 on ''The New York Times'' Best Seller list in 2000.

Johnson's first leading film role was in ''The Scorpion King'' in 2002. For this, he was paid US$5.5 million, a world record for an actor in his first starring role. One of his more prominent roles is Luke Hobbs in ''The Fast and the Furious'' franchise. He hosted and produced ''The Hero'', a reality competition series and has since continued to produce TV shows and films through his production company Seven Bucks Productions. In 2013, ''Forbes'' listed Johnson No. 25 in the Top 100 Most Powerful Celebrities and he has been in the top twenty every year since. He was the world's highest-paid actor of 2016. ''Time'' named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2016.
In 2015, ''Muscle & Fitness'' named him "Man of the Century".

== Life and career ==

=== 19721995: Childhood ===
Dwayne Douglas Johnson was born on May 2, 1972 in Hayward, California, the son of Ata Johnson (''ne'' Maivia) and professional wrestler Rocky Johnson (born Wayde Douglas Bowles). His maternal grandfather, "High Chief" Peter Maivia, was also a wrestler, and his maternal grandmother, Lia Maivia, was one of wrestling's few female promoters, taking over Polynesian Pacific Pro Wrestling after her husband's death in 1982, until 1988. Johnson's father is a black Canadian (Nova Scotian), and also has a small amount of Irish ancestry. His mother is from a Samoan family. His father was part of the first black tag team to win the World Tag Team Championship in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Through his mother, he is considered a non-blood relative of the Anoa'i wrestling family.{{Citation |title=The Anoa'i family wrestling dynasty: photos |newspaper=WWE |quote=High Chief Peter Maivia, The Rock's grandfather, was "blood brothers" with The Wild Samoans' father, Amituanai Anoa'i. |url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/anoai-family-photos |accessdate=November 29, 2015}}{{Citation |last=Sonny |first=Julian |title=Samoan Strength: The Rocks Family Tree Is A Wrestling Dynasty |newspaper=Elite Daily |date=November 16, 2015 |url=http://elitedaily.com/sports/the-rock-family-tree-infographic/1282191/ |accessdate=November 29, 2015}}{{Citation |last=Pockross |first=Adam |title=The Rocks Grandfather Was a Bond Villain: Could It Be Another Family Business? |newspaper=Yahoo!

Johnson briefly lived in New Zealand with his mother's family, settling in Grey Lynn. He attended Richmond Road Primary School, before returning to the U.S. with his parents. In the United States, he attended Shepherd Glen Elementary School and Hamden Middle School in Hamden, Connecticut,[http://www.nhregister.com/news/article/NEW-HAVEN-200-Introducing-a-summer-series-11511479.php "NEW HAVEN 200: Introducing a summer series looking back on two centuries of sports"], Chip Malafronte, New Haven Register, June 23, 2012 then spent 10th grade at President William McKinley High School in Honolulu, Hawaii. As he entered 11th grade, his father's job required his relocation to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where Johnson began playing football at Freedom High School in the East Penn Conference. He was also a member of the school's track and field and wrestling teams.

Johnson was a promising football prospect and received offers from many Division I collegiate programs. He decided on a full scholarship from the University of Miami, playing defensive tackle. In 1991, he was on the Miami Hurricanes's national championship team. When an injury sidelined him, he was replaced by future National Football League (NFL) Hall of Fame player Warren Sapp. While attending Miami, Johnson met his future wife, Dany Garcia, who graduated from the university in 1992 and later became a member of its Board of Trustees. She also founded a Miami-based wealth management firm. In 2006, the couple donated $2 million to build a living room at the University's Newman Alumni Center.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Johnson graduated from Miami in 1995 with a Bachelor of General Studies in criminology and physiology. He joined the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League in 1995. He was on the practice roster as a backup linebacker, but was cut two months into the season.{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} On November 10, 2007, Johnson returned to the Miami Orange Bowl to participate in the festivities surrounding the University of Miami's last home football game at the stadium.

=== Professional wrestling ===
==== 19951996: Training ====
Like his father and grandfather, several of Johnson's other (non-blood) relatives are or were professional wrestlers, including his uncles, Afa and Sika Anoai (The Wild Samoans) and his cousins, Rodney (Yokozuna), Solofa (Rikishi), Matt (Rosey)  and Eddie (Umaga). When Johnson declared his intent to become a wrestler, his father initially resisted, but then agreed to train him himself, warning that he would not go easy on him. Veteran wrestler Pat Patterson got Johnson several tryout matches with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1996. Under his real name, he defeated The Brooklyn Brawler at a house show and lost the other matches to Chris Candido and Owen Hart. After wrestling at Jerry Lawler's United States Wrestling Association as Flex Kavana and winning the USWA World Tag Team Championship twice with Bart Sawyer in the summer of 1996, Johnson signed a WWF contract. He received additional training from Tom Prichard, alongside Achim Albrecht and Mark Henry.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment ===
==== 19961997: Intercontinental Champion ====
Johnson made his WWF debut as Rocky Maivia, a combination of his father and grandfather's ring names, although his real name was acknowledged by the announcers. He was initially reluctant to take this ring name but was persuaded by Vince McMahon and Jim Ross. He was given the nickname "The Blue Chipper" and his lineage was played to on TV, where he was hyped as the WWF's first third-generation wrestler. Maivia, a clean-cut face character, was pushed heavily from the start despite his wrestling inexperience. He debuted on ''Monday Night Raw'' as a member of Marc Mero's entourage on November 4, 1996 and had his first match at Survivor Series on November 17, in an eight-man elimination tag match; he was the sole survivor by single-handedly eliminating Crush and Goldust. WWF fans generally rejected him because of his cheesy character. On February 13, 1997, he won the Intercontinental Championship from Hunter Hearst Helmsley on ''Monday Night Raw''. Maivia successfully defended the title at In Your House 13: Final Four against Hunter Hearst Helmsley and at WrestleMania 13 against The Sultan. He defeated Bret Hart by disqualification in a title defense on March 31 episode of ''Raw is War''. On April 20 at In Your House 14: Revenge of the 'Taker, he lost to Savio Vega by countout, retaining the title for the final time. Audiences became increasingly hostile toward Maivia, with chants of "Die, Rocky, die!" and "Rocky sucks!" being heard during his matches.

==== 19971998: The Nation of Domination ====
left|upright|thumb|As part of the Nation of Domination, The Rock won the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship for a second time and held it for 265 days]]
After losing the Intercontinental Championship to Owen Hart on the April 28, 1997 episode of ''Raw Is War'' and suffering a legitimate knee injury in a match against Mankind, Maivia returned in August 1997 and turned heel by joining Faarooq, D'Lo Brown and Kama in the stable called the Nation of Domination. During this time, he refused to acknowledge the Rocky Maivia name, instead referring to himself in the third person as The Rock, though he would still be billed as Rocky "The Rock" Maivia until 1998. As The Rock, he insulted the audience in his promos as well as WWF television interviewers, once calling Kevin Kelly an "ugly hermaphrodite".

At D-Generation X: In Your House, Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated The Rock in under six minutes to retain the Intercontinental Championship. The next night on ''Raw Is War'', Austin was ordered by Mr. McMahon to defend the title in a rematch, but forfeited it to The Rock instead, handing him the title belt before hitting him with the ''Stone Cold Stunner''. The Rock feuded with Austin and Ken Shamrock through the end of 1997 and beginning of 1998. On the March 30 episode of ''Raw is War'', The Rock debuted a new Intercontinental Championship belt which was used to represent the title until October 2, 2011, when the previous design was reused. Later that night, The Rock would also overthrow Faarooq as leader of the Nation of Domination to spark a feud between the two and successfully defended the Intercontinental title against Faarooq at Over the Edge: In Your House on May 31, 1998.

The Rock and The Nation then feuded with Triple H and D-Generation X (DX), with the two stable leaders first meeting in the quarter-final of the 1998 King of the Ring tournament, which The Rock won. At King of the Ring, The Rock defeated Dan Severn in the semi-final match and lost to rival Ken Shamrock in the final. The Rock then resumed his feud with Triple H, as the two had a two out of three falls match at Fully Loaded: In Your House for the Intercontinental title, which The Rock retained in controversial fashion. This led to a ladder match at SummerSlam, in which Triple H won the title. At Breakdown: In Your House, The Rock defeated Ken Shamrock and Mankind in a triple threat steel cage match to become the number one contender for the WWF Championship. The Rock then feuded with fellow Nation member Mark Henry, effectively breaking up the stable.

==== 19981999: The Corporation ====
{{Main|The Corporation (professional wrestling)|l1=The Corporation}}
thumb|upright|As part of [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation, The Rock feuded with Stone Cold Steve Austin and stole Austin's personalized WWF Championship, the Smoking Skull belt]]
The Rock's entertaining promos and ensuing popularity led to a face turn, in which he called himself "The People's Champion". This led to a feud with Mr. McMahon, who said he had "a problem with the people" and would thus target "The People's Champion". A double turn occurred at Survivor Series, when The Rock defeated McMahon's associate, Mankind, in the finals of the "Deadly Game" tournament for the vacant WWF Championship in a fashion reminiscent of the Montreal Screwjob. The Rock allied with Vince and Shane McMahon as the crown jewel of their stable, The Corporation. On December 13, 1998 at the pay-per-view named for him, Rock Bottom: In Your House, The Rock had a rematch with Mankind for the WWF Championship. Mankind appeared to win the match when The Rock passed out in the Mandible Claw submission move, but Mr. McMahon ruled that since The Rock did not tap out, he retained his title.

The Rock continued to feud with Mankind over the WWF Championship, which was traded back and forth between them. First, in the main event of the January 4, 1999 episode of ''Raw Is War'', Mankind defeated The Rock after interference from Stone Cold Steve Austin. Then, in an "I Quit" match at Royal Rumble on January 24, The Rock regained the title, when a recording of Mankind saying "I quit" from an earlier interview was played over the PA system. On ''Halftime Heat'' (an episode of ''Sunday Night Heat'' aired in the same timeslot as the Super Bowl XXXIII halftime show) on January 31, Mankind pinned The Rock using a forklift truck in an empty arena match. The two faced off again at St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House in a last man standing match which ended in a draw, meaning Mankind retained the title. Their feud ended on February 15 ''Raw Is War'', when The Rock won his third WWF Championship in a ladder match after Big Show performed a chokeslam on Mankind off the ladder. The Rock lost the WWF Championship to Stone Cold Steve Austin at WrestleMania XV.

Though he was a villain, his amusing verbal skills led many fans to cheer The Rock, who then lost the title rematch at Backlash: In Your House and was thus betrayed by Shane McMahon, turning him back into a fan favorite and beginning a feud with Triple H, The Undertaker and The Corporate Ministry that saw The Rock defeating Triple H at Over the Edge, but then losing to WWF Champion The Undertaker at King of the Ring. The Rock lost a number one contender's match to Triple H at Fully Loaded after interference from Mr. Ass. This sparked a feud with Mr. Ass, culminating in a Kiss My Ass match at SummerSlam, which The Rock won.

==== 19992002: Record-breaking WWF/WWE Champion ====
{{See also|The Rock 'n' Sock Connection|The Invasion (professional wrestling)}}
Toward the latter part of 1999, The Rock had several singles and tag team championship opportunities, teaming with former enemy Mankind as The Rock 'n' Sock Connection after he challenged WWF Tag Team Champions The Undertaker and Big Show and Mankind offered his help. They won the title for the first of three times. The two performed numerous comedic skits together, including one on ''Raw Is War'' called "This Is Your Life" (based on the TV show), in which Mankind produced people from The Rock's past, such as his high school girlfriend and his high school football coach. The segment earned an 8.4 Nielsen rating, one of the highest ratings ever for a ''Raw'' segment.

thumb|left|upright|The Rock's popularity was fueled by his charisma and speaking abilities, which led to many catchphrases and merchandising opportunities
At Royal Rumble on January 23, 2000, The Rock entered the Royal Rumble match and was one of the final two remaining, along with Big Show; Show seemingly intended to throw The Rock over the top rope in a running powerslam-like position, but Rock countered the move on the ring apron, sending Big Show to the floor before re-entering the ring as the winner. However, The Rock's feet hit the floor first, although those watching the event on TV did not see that, until Big Show proved this with additional video footage, and claimed to be the rightful winner. Despite this proof, the original decision could not be reversed, so a number one contender's match for the WWF Championship was held at No Way Out, which Big Show won after Shane McMahon interfered and hit The Rock in the head with a steel chair as he attempted to execute a ''People's Elbow''. The Rock defeated Big Show on March 13 episode of ''Raw Is War'' to regain the right to face the WWF Champion, Triple H, at WrestleMania 2000 in a fatal four-way elimination match, also including Big Show and Mick Foley. Each wrestler had a McMahon in his corner: Triple H had his wife, Stephanie, Foley had Linda, The Rock had Vince and Big Show had Shane. Triple H retained the title after Vince betrayed The Rock by hitting him with a chair.

thumb|upright|The Rock as the WWF Champion in 2000
In the following weeks, The Rock continued his feud with Triple H and eventually won his fourth WWF Championship, which he won on April 30 at Backlash after Stone Cold Steve Austin intervened on his behalf. On May 21 at Judgment Day, The Rock and Triple H faced in an Iron Man match with Shawn Michaels as the special guest referee. With the score tied at five falls each and with seconds left on the time limit The Rock was disqualified when The Undertaker attacked Triple H, thus giving Triple H the 65 win and the title. The next night on ''Raw Is War'', The Rock got his revenge by taking out the entire McMahon-Helmsley Faction with The Undertaker's help. The Rock won the WWF Championship for a fifth time at King of the Ring on June 25 by scoring the winning pin in a six-man tag team match, teaming with Kane and The Undertaker against Shane McMahon, Triple H and Vince McMahon, whom he pinned. The Rock successfully defended the championship against Chris Benoit at Fully Loaded on July 23, Kurt Angle and Triple H at SummerSlam on August 27 and Benoit, Kane and The Undertaker at Unforgiven on September 24.

The Rock lost the WWF Championship to Angle at No Mercy in October. Around this time, The Rock feuded with Rikishi and defeated him at Survivor Series. The Rock wrestled a six-man Hell in a Cell match for the WWF Championship at Armageddon, which Kurt Angle won to retain the title. On December 18 on ''Raw'', The Rock won the WWF Tag Team Championship with The Undertaker, defeating Edge and Christian, then losing it back to them the next night at a ''SmackDown!'' taping. In 2001, The Rock continued to feud with Angle over the WWF Championship, culminating at No Way Out in February, where he pinned Angle to win the WWF Championship for a sixth time. The Rock then feuded with the Royal Rumble winner, Stone Cold Steve Austin, whom he lost the title at WrestleMania X-Seven after Austin allied with Mr. McMahon, who interfered on his behalf. On the next night's ''Raw Is War'', during a steel cage title rematch, Triple H came to the ring with a sledgehammer and it seemed he would help The Rock, because of the rivalry between Austin and Triple H (and an argument with McMahon earlier in the night), but he attacked him instead, allying with McMahon and Austin. Austin and Triple H formed a tag team called The Power Trip, while The Rock was indefinitely suspended. Johnson used this time off to act in the movie ''The Mummy Returns''.

The Rock returned to the WWF in late July 2001 and had to decide whether to join the WWF or The Alliance (a group of former WCW and ECW wrestlers) during The Invasion, eventually siding with the WWF. At SummerSlam, The Rock defeated Booker T to win the WCW Championship. He lost the title to Chris Jericho at No Mercy. The next night on ''Raw'', he teamed with Jericho to win the WWF Tag Team Championship from The Dudley Boyz.

thumb|The Rock during WrestleMania X8 before facing [[Hulk Hogan|"Hollywood" Hulk Hogan]]
The Rock defeated Jericho on November 5 episode of ''Raw'' for his second WCW Championship. As part of the WWF's battle against The Alliance, The Rock wrestled in a "winner takes all" ten-man elimination match at Survivor Series. In the end, it came down to a one-on-one with Steve Austin (who had recently joined The Alliance). The Rock seemed to have the upper hand, until Jericho (a member of Team WWF, who was eliminated a few minutes earlier), entered the ring and attacked The Rock. Austin tried to capitalize on this by pinning The Rock, but Kurt Angle, a Team Alliance member, revealed his true allegiance by hitting Austin in the head with a title belt. The Rock then pinned Austin, forcing The Alliance to disband. The Rock's WCW Championship was renamed the unbranded "World Championship" following the Alliance's loss. The Rock closed out 2001 by losing the World Championship at Vengeance to Chris Jericho, who would unify the WWF and WCW titles later that night.

The Rock unsuccessfully challenged Jericho for the now Undisputed WWF Championship at Royal Rumble, but defeated The Undertaker at No Way Out. Three weeks before WrestleMania, The Rock headlined WWE's Asian tour to Japan, Singapore and Malaysia. The first show was in Yokohama Arena and had sold 18,000 tickets in sixty minutes. Jericho, who was booked to face him for all three shows, said he brought out the best in him and described his reaction as "one of the loudest I'd ever heard in my career. It was as if Elvis had joined The Beatles and all of them were wearing Godzilla costumes". He then feuded with the New World Order, after challenging Hollywood Hulk Hogan to a match at WrestleMania X8. The match was billed as icon versus icon, with both men representing the top tier of two generations of wrestling; ultimately Rock pinned Hogan at WrestleMania X8. After the nWo turned on Hogan for losing the match, The Rock allied with him and was drafted to the SmackDown! brand, becoming the first WWF wrestler to be drafted in the WWF draft lottery before taking a short sabbatical from wrestling.

When he returned, The Rock won his then record-breaking seventh WWF/WWE Championship (which had been renamed the WWE Undisputed Championship after the WWF was renamed to WWE in May 2002) at Vengeance on July 21, defeating Kurt Angle and The Undertaker in a triple threat match. The Rock successfully defended the title at Global Warning in Australia against Triple H and Brock Lesnar by pinning Triple H, who saved The Rock when Lesnar attacked him after the match. At SummerSlam on August 25, after interference from Lesnar's manager Paul Heyman and the use of a steel chair, The Rock lost the WWE Championship to Lesnar along with the record for the youngest WWE Champion, which he had set in 1998. Following the loss against Lesnar, The Rock publicly declared that whether or not the crowd booed him he would always be the People's Champion, criticizing the fans in the arena and again taking a sabbatical from wrestling in order to focus on his film career.

==== 20032004: Final feuds ====
thumb|The Rock (right) defeated Stone Cold Austin in the latter's final match at WrestleMania XIX in March 2003
The Rock returned on January 30, 2003, episode of ''SmackDown!'' to publicly criticize Hulk Hogan and make it clear that because of the success of his Hollywood career, WWE was no longer a priority and thus reestablishing him as a villain for the first time since 1999. Rock defeated Hogan again at No Way Out and drafted himself to the ''Raw'' brand where he had various feuds, including one with The Hurricane. He also performed "Rock concerts", segments in which he played the guitar and mocked the show's host city.

After failing to win number one contendership for the World Heavyweight Championship, The Rock turned his attention to Steve Austin who, to The Rock's chagrin, had been chosen as "Superstar of the Decade". This led to a match at WrestleMania XIX, which called back to their previous two WrestleMania encounters, both of which Austin had won. The Rock won after delivering three consecutive ''Rock Bottoms'', ending their long-running feud in what turned out to be Austin's final match. The next night, ''Raw'' was billed as "The Rock Appreciation Night", in honour of his victory over Austin. That night, he was attacked by a debuting Goldberg. At Backlash, Goldberg defeated The Rock, who then left WWE as an active wrestler to focus on his film career.

The Rock then occasionally returned to WWE in non-wrestling roles, gradually turning face again by engaging in one night feuds against heels such as Chris Jericho and Christian. The Rock aided Mick Foley in his feud against Evolution, leading to a reunion of The Rock 'n' Sock Connection. They faced Ric Flair, Randy Orton, and Batista in a handicap match at WrestleMania XX, losing when Orton pinned Foley after the RKO. It turned out to be Rock's last match for the next seven years. The Rock appeared in WWE sporadically following WrestleMania XX. He stood up for Eugene, made a cameo in his hometown of Miami and helped Mick Foley turn back La Rsistance. Later in 2004, he hosted a pie-eating contest, as part of the WWE Diva Search and ended the segment by giving Jonathan Coachman a spinebuster and a ''People's Elbow''. After this, he stated in several interviews that he was no longer under contract to WWE. He stated that he would continue using the trademarked name "The Rock", per a dual ownership deal between him and WWE.

==== 20042009: Sporadic appearances ====
On August 23, 2004, episode of ''Raw'', The Rock returned and took out Jonathan Coachman and La Rsistance. In October 2005, The Rock did a tell all interview with WWE.com, he talked his contract with WWE, movies and feelings on a dream match with Shawn Michaels.  On March 12, 2007, The Rock appeared on a WWE show after nearly three years, via a pre-taped promo shown during ''Raw''. He correctly predicted that Bobby Lashley would defeat Umaga at WrestleMania 23 in Donald Trump and Vince McMahon's "Battle of the Billionaires" match. On March 29, 2008, The Rock inducted his father, Rocky Johnson, and his grandfather, Peter Maivia, into the WWE Hall of Fame. During his induction speech, he roasted wrestlers John Cena, Santino Marella, Chris Jericho, Mick Foley, Shawn Michaels, and Stone Cold Steve Austin. In September 2009, he appeared at a World Xtreme Wrestling (WXW) show to support the pro wrestling debut of Sarona Snuka, the daughter of his long-time friend and mentor Jimmy Snuka. On October 2, 2009, the ten-year anniversary of ''SmackDown'', The Rock (with his usual flattop hair shaved off) cut a promo via pre-recorded video.

On February 14, 2011, episode of ''Raw'', The Rock was revealed as the host of WrestleMania XXVII, appearing live on ''Raw'' for the first time in almost seven years. During a lengthy promo, he addressed the fans, Michael Cole, The Miz and John Cena, calling Cena a "big fat bowl of Fruity Pebbles", inspiring a popular crowd chant and sign. The Rock claimed to love wrestling, having been born into the business, a claim Cena argued. After numerous appearances via satellite, The Rock appeared live on the ''Raw'' before WrestleMania XXVII to confront Cena, with whom he had been feuding through Twitter, making fun of Cena's clothing and calling him a "homeless Power Ranger" and "Vanilla Ice". After he and Cena exchanged insults, The Miz and Alex Riley appeared and attacked The Rock; he fended off Miz and Riley, only for Cena to blindside him with an ''Attitude Adjustment''.

thumb|left|The Rock (right) and John Cena on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw'', agreeing to a match at WrestleMania XXVIII one year in advance]]
On April 3 at WrestleMania XXVII, The Rock opened the show by cutting a promo. After appearing in numerous backstage segments, The Rock came to ringside to restart the main event between Cena and The Miz as a No Disqualification match, after it had ended in a draw. As revenge for the ''Attitude Adjustment'' Cena had given him on ''Raw'', Rock hit Cena with the ''Rock Bottom'', allowing The Miz to pin him and retain the WWE Championship. After the match, Rock attacked Miz and hit him with the ''People's Elbow''. The following night on ''Raw'', Cena challenged The Rock to a match at WrestleMania XXVIII the next year, which Rock accepted. They then worked together to fend off an attack by The Corre, which at the time consisted of Wade Barrett, Heath Slater, Justin Gabriel, and Ezekiel Jackson. The Rock appeared live on ''Raw'' in his hometown of Miami to celebrate his 39th birthday.

thumb|The Rock celebrating his victory at WrestleMania XXVIII in April 2012
On September 16, WWE announced The Rock would wrestle in a traditional 5-on-5 Survivor Series tag team match, teaming with Cena at Survivor Series in November.
