'''Alicia Augello Cook''' (born January 25, 1981), known professionally as '''Alicia Keys''', is an  American singer-songwriter. A classically-trained pianist, Keys was composing songs by age 12. She was signed at 15 years old by Columbia Records, and then, after label disputes over creative differences, by Arista Records. Her debut album, ''Songs in A Minor'' was released with J Records in 2001. Praised for Keys' musical talents and creative control, ''Songs in A Minor'' was critically and commercially successful, producing her first ''Billboard'' Hot 100 number-one single "Fallin'" and selling over 12 million copies worldwide. ''Songs in A Minor'' earned Keys five Grammy Awards in 2002. Her second album, ''The Diary of Alicia Keys'' (2003), was also a critical and commercial success, spawning successful singles "You Don't Know My Name", "If I Ain't Got You" and "Diary", and sold eight million copies worldwide. The album garnered her an additional four Grammy Awards. The duet song "My Boo" with Usher scored her a second number-one single in 2004. Keys released her first live album, ''Unplugged'' (2005), and became the first female to have an ''MTV Unplugged'' album debut at number one.

''As I Am'' (2007) produced the Hot 100 number-one single "No One", selling 5 million copies worldwide and earning an additional three Grammy Awards. Keys made her film debut in ''Smokin' Aces'' and also went on to appear in ''The Nanny Diaries'' and ''The Secret Life of Bees''. ''The Element of Freedom'' (2009) became her first chart-topping album in the UK, and selling 4 million copies worldwide.

Considered a pop icon, Keys was named by ''Billboard'' the top R&B artist of the 2000s decade and placed her number 10 on their list of Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years. VH1 also included her on their 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and 100 Greatest Women in Music lists, while ''Time'' have named her in their 100 list of most influential people in 2005 and 2017. Keys is co-founder and Global Ambassador of the nonprofit HIV/AIDS-fighting organization Keep a Child Alive.

==Early life==
Alicia Augello Cook was born on January 25, 1981, in the Hell's Kitchen neighboord of New York Citys Manhattan borough. She is the only child of Teresa (Augello), a paralegal and part-time actress, and one of three children of Craig Cook, a flight attendant. Keys' father is African American and her mother is of Sicilian (Sciacca) and either Scottish or Irish descent. Named after her Puerto Rican godmother, Keys expressed that she was comfortable with her multiracial heritage because she felt she was able to "relate to different cultures". Keys' father left when she was two and she was subsequently raised by her mother during her formative years in Hell's Kitchen. Keys said her parents never had a relationship, and her father was not in her life. Although she did not like to speak about her father in order to not feed stereotypes, Keys remarked in 2001: "I'm not in contact with him. That's fine. When I was younger, I minded about that. [It] made me angry. But it helped show me what a strong woman my mother was, and made me want to be strong like her. Probably, it was better for me this way." Keys and her mother lived in a one-room apartment. Her mother often worked three jobs to provide for Keys, who "learned how to survive" from her mother's example of tenacity and self-reliance. 

{{quote box|width=29%|align=left|"I grew up in the middle of everything. I walked the streets alone, I rode the trains alone, I came home at three in the morning alone, that was what I did." "The city had a huge influence on me because it's such a diverse place. As hard as [growing up in it was], I always felt very blessed about being able to recognize different cultures and styles, people and places. I feel like the concrete alone just gave me a certain drive. I really saw everything: every negative I could possibly see from the time I could walk until now; and also every positive, every bright future, every dream that I could possibly see. So growing up around this big dichotomy definitely influenced my music."|source=Keys}} 

From a young age, Keys struggled with self-esteem issues, "hiding" little by little when her differences made her vulnerable to judgement and later uninvited sexual attention. Living in the rough neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen, she was, from an early age, regularly exposed to street violence, drugs, prostitution, and subjected to sexual propositions in the sex trade- and crime-riddled area. "I saw a variety of people growing up, and lifestyles, lows and highs. I think it makes you realise right away what you want and what you don't want", Keys said. Keys recalled feeling fearful early on of the "animal instinct" she witnessed, and eventually feeling "high" due to recurrent harassment. Her experiences in the streets had led her to carry a homemade knife for protection. She became very wary, emotionally guarded, and she began wearing gender-neutral clothing and what would become her trademark cornrows.{{efn|}} Keys explained that she is grateful for growing up where she did as it prepared her for the parallels in the music industry, particularly as she was a teenager starting out; she could maintain a particular focus and not derail herself. She credits her "tough" mother for anchoring her on a right path as opposed to many people she knew who ended up on the wrong path and in jail. Keys attributed her unusual maturity as a young girl to her mother, who depended on her to be responsible while she worked to provide for them and give Keys as many opportunities as possible.

Keys loved music and singing from early childhood. She recalled her mother playing jazz records of artists like Thelonious Monk, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong on Sunday mornings, early musical moments Keys considers influential in kindling her interest in and emotional connection to music. In preschool, Keys sung in her school's production of the musical ''Cats'' and was cast as Dorothy Gale in a production of ''The Wizard of Oz''. Keys discovered she had a passion for the piano by age six, as she loved the sound and feel of the instrument and desired to play and learn it. A friend had given her an old, upright piano, a pivotal gift for Keys as it allowed her to play and take lessons as a child. Keys began receiving classical piano training by age seven, practicing six hours a day, learning the Suzuki method and playing composers such as Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin, and Satie. She was particularly drawn to "blue, dark, shadowy" and melancholic compositions, as well as the passionate romanticism of "blue composers" like Chopin.  Inspired by the film ''Philadelphia'', Keys wrote her first song about her departed grandfather on her piano by age 12. The scene in the film where Tom Hanks's character listens to opera on a record player notably affected Keys, who "never showed emotion very well". After seeing the film, Keys, "for the first time, could express how [she] felt through the music." 

Keys' mother had encouraged her to participate in different extracurricular activities, including music, dance, theater, and gymnastics, so she could "find her muse". Her extracurricular activities gave her focus and drive, and helped keep her out of trouble. Keys remained so occupied with her various pursuits that she experienced her first burnout before adolescence. Before her 13th birthday, she expressed to her mother that she was too overwhelmed and wanted to disengage, at which point her mother took a vacation with her and encouraged her to keep focusing on piano. Keys would continue studying classical music till the age of 18. Keys regards her education in classical piano and dedication to classical music as vital for her stability in her youth and her development as a musician and songwriter.

Keys enrolled in the Professional Performing Arts School at the age of 12, where she took music, dance, and theater classes and majored in choir. In her preteen years, Keys and her bass-playing friend formed their first group, though neither "knew too much about how pop songs worked". Keys would continue singing, writing songs, and performing in musical groups throughout junior high and high school. She became an accomplished pianist, and after her classical music teacher had nothing left to teach her, she began studying Jazz at age 14. Living in the "musical melting pot" city, Keys had already been discovering other genres of music, including soul music, hip hop, R&B, and taken affinity to artists like Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield. Keen on dissecting music, Keys continued developing her songwriting and finding her own 'flow and style" through her exploration of the intricacies in different music. 

{{Quote box|width=28%|quote=Classical piano totally helped me to be a better songwriter and a better musician...I knew the fundamentals of music. And I understood how to put things together and pull it together and change it. The dedication that it took to study classical music is a big reason why I have anything in this life I think. ... [It] was a big influence on me. It opened a lot of doors because it separated me from the rest. [...] And it did help me structure my songs.|source=Keys}}

Keys spent more time in Harlem during her teenage years. She connected with the cultural and racial diversity in the neighborhood, where she expanded upon her musical exploration, and her character was also solidified. "Harlem raised me in a lot of ways," Keys remarked. "[It] taught me how to think fast, how to play the game...taught me leadership, how to get out of bad situations when you need to, how to hold my own." During this period, she met her friend and future collaborator Kerry Brothers Jr. 

In 1994, manager Jeff Robinson met 13-year old Keys, who participated in his brother's youth organization, Teens in Motion. Robinson's brother had been giving Keys vocal lessons in Harlem. His brother had talked to him about Keys and advised him to go see her, but Robinson shrugged it off as he had "heard that story 1,000 times". At the time, Keys was part of a three-girl band that had formed in the Bronx and was performing in Harlem. Robinson eventually agreed to his brother's request, and went to see Keys perform with her group at the Police Athletic Center league in Harlem. He was soon taken by her, her singing, playing classical music and performing her own songs. Robinson was excited by audiences' incredulous reactions to her. Impressed by her talents, charisma, image, and maturity, Robinson considered her to be the "total package", and took her under his wing. By this time, Keys had already written two of the songs that she would later include on her debut album, "Butterflyz" and "The Life". 

Robinson wanted Keys to be fully informed and ready for the music industry, so he took her everywhere with him, including all the meetings with attorneys and negotiations with record labels, while the teenager often became disgruntled with the process. Robinson had urged Keys to pursue a solo career, as she remained reluctant, preferring the musical interactions of a group. She took Robinson's advice after her group disbanded, and contacted Robinson who in 1995 introduced her to A&R executive Peter Edge. Edge later described his first impressions of Keys to HitQuarters: {{quote|"I remember that I felt, upon meeting her, that she was completely unique. I had never met a young R&B artist with that level of musicianship. So many people were just singing on top of loops and tracks, but she had the ability, not only to be part of hip-hop, but also to go way beyond that. Shes a very accomplished musician, songwriter and vocalist and a rare and unique talent."}} 

==Career==
===19962002: ''Songs in A Minor''=== 
Robinson and Edge helped Keys assemble some demos of songs she had written and set up a showcase for label executives. Keys performed on the piano for executives of various labels, and a bidding war ensued. Edge was keen to sign Keys himself but was unable to do so at that time due to being on the verge of leaving his present record company, Warner Bros. Records, to work at Clive Davis' Arista Records. During this period, Columbia Records had approached Keys for a record deal, offering her a $26,000 white baby grand piano; after negotiations with her and her manager, she signed to the label, at age 15. Keys was also finishing high school, and her academic success had provided her opportunity for scholarship and early admission to university. That year, Keys accepted a scholarship to study at Columbia University in Manhattan. She graduated high school early as valedictorian, at the age of 16, and began attending Columbia University while working on her music.

At first, Keys attempted to manage both university and her budding music career, but after a month, she dropped out of college to pursue her musical career full-time.

Keys signed a demo deal with Jermaine Dupri and So So Def Recordings, where she appeared on the label's Christmas album performing "The Little Drummer Girl". She also co-wrote and recorded a song titled "Dah Dee Dah (Sexy Thing)", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 1997 film, ''Men in Black''. The song was Keys' first professional recording; however, it was never released as a single and her record contract with Columbia ended after a dispute with the label. Keys was unhappy with the label because her career had stalled during her two years under contract at Columbia due to executive indecision over her direction and major changes within the company. Keys called Clive Davis, who sensed a "special, unique" artist from her performance and signed her to Arista Records, which later disbanded.|accessdate=November 2, 2010}} Keys almost chose Wilde as her stage name until her manager suggested the name Keys after a dream he had. Keys felt that name represented her both as a performer and person.

Following Davis to his newly formed J Records label, she worked with Kerry "Krucial" Brothers and recorded the songs "Rock wit U" and "Rear View Mirror", which were featured on the soundtracks to the films ''Shaft'' (2000) and ''Dr. Dolittle 2'' (2001), respectively.|title=Dr. Dolittle 2  Overview|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason |work=Allmusic|accessdate=November 2, 2010}} Keys' first studio album ''Songs in A Minor'' was released in June 2001, to critical acclaim. Musically, it incorporated classical piano in an R&B, soul and jazz album. Jane Stevenson of ''Jam!'' described the music as "old-school urban sounds and attitude set against a backdrop of classical piano and sweet, warm vocals". ''USA Today''{{'}}s Steve Jones wrote that Keys "taps into the blues, soul, jazz and even classical music to propel haunting melodies and hard-driving funk". Debuting at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 with first-week sales of 236,000 units, it went on to sell over 6.2million copies in the United States and 12 million copies internationally.[http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart_watch/39906/chart-watch-extra-the-top-20-new-acts-of-the-2000s/ Chart Watch Extra: The Top 20 New Acts Of The 2000s] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013084002/http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart_watch/39906/chart-watch-extra-the-top-20-new-acts-of-the-2000s/ |date=October 13, 2011 }} Chart Watch by Paul Grein Additionally, it was certified six times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.

Later that year, Keys released her novel ''Tears for Water: Songbook of Poems and Lyrics'', a collection of unreleased poems from her journals and lyrics. The title derived from one of her poems, "Love and Chains" from the line: "I don't mind drinking my tears for water." She said the title is the foundation of her writing because "everything I have ever written has stemmed from my tears of joy, of pain, of sorrow, of depression, even of question". The book sold over US$500,000 and Keys made ''The New York Times'' bestseller list in 2005. The following year, she won a second consecutive award for Best R&B Video at the MTV Video Music Awards for the video "Karma".

In an interview with ''Blender'' magazine, Keys allegedly said "'Gangsta rap' was a ploy to convince black people to kill each other, 'gangsta rap' didn't exist" and went on to say that it was created by "the government". The magazine also claimed she said that Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. were "essentially assassinated, their beefs stoked by the government and the media, to stop another great black leader from existing". Keys later wrote a statement clarifying the issues and saying her words were misinterpreted. Later that year, Keys was criticized by anti-smoking campaigners after billboard posters for her forthcoming concerts in Indonesia featured a logo for the A Mild cigarette brand sponsored by tobacco firm Philip Morris.

From the beginning of her career, Keys has been noted for being a multifaceted talent, as a singer, songwriter, musician, arranger, and producer. She received notability for her singularity and maturity as a classical musician and singer-songwriter. ''The Times'' wrote that Keys' debut album, ''Songs in A Minor'', "spoke from a soul that seemed way beyond its years", and her follow up, ''The Diary of Alicia Keys'', "confirmed her place in musical history". ''The Seattle Times'' described Key's third album, ''As I Am'', as "another remarkable collection of varied songs that show her depth as a songwriter, singer and pianist." ''USA Today'', in a review of ''Songs in A Minor'', commended Keys' "musical, artistic and thematic maturity" starting out her career. ''The Japan Times'' praised Keys' production of ''Songs in A Minor'', displaying "the kind of taste and restraint that is rare in current mainstream R&B". ''Billboard'' wrote that her debut "introduced a different kind of pop singer. Not only was she mean on the ivories, but she showed true musicianship, writing and performing her material", and Keys continued developing her artistry with subsequent albums. ''Rolling Stone'' remarked that Keys broke into the music world as a singer "with hip-hop swagger, an old-school soul sound and older school (as in Chopin) piano chops", her appeal "bridging the generation gap". Keys's debut album, ''PopMatters'' wrote, reflects her sensibilities as young woman and as a "musical, cultural, and racial hybrid."

Keys is also distinguished for being in control of her artistic output and image and having fought for creative independence since getting signed at 15 years old. ''PopMatters'' called Keys an artist who "clearly has a fine sense of her creative talents and has struggled to make sure they are represented in the best way." ''Rolling Stone'' wrote that, with her classical training, Keys "reintroduced the idea of a self-reliant (but still pop-friendly) R&B singer-songwriter  a type that stretches back to Stevie Wonder", crossing generational lines in the process. ''Blender'' magazine referred to her as "the first new pop artist of the millennium who was capable of changing music" with her complex of talents.

Keys has been praised for her expressive vocals and emotive delivery. In a review of ''Songs in A Minor'', Jam! complimented her "crooning" and "warm" vocals as well as her belting "gospel-style". ''CMJ New Music Monthly'' commended her "deep soulful voice and heartfelt delivery" of her songs. ''Q'' magazine compared her vocal talent to Mary J Blige's and acknowledged her "sincerity" as "another plus" to her musical instincts. ''PopMatters'' noted her "deep purple vocals" and considered that Keys is "less concerned about technical proficiency" and more interested in "rendering musical moments as authentic and visceral as possible". ''The Guardian'' wrote that Keys "sings with devastating allure". Reviewing a live performance, the ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote that Keys has a "commanding voice" and the "style and vision to convey the character and detail of the songs", and praised "the range and taste of her musical instincts".

An accomplished classical pianist, Keys incorporates piano into a majority of her songs and often writes about love, heartbreak and female empowerment. She has cited several artists as her inspirations, inclcuding Carole King, Prince, Nina Simone, Marvin Gaye, Quincy Jones, Donny Hathaway, Curtis Mayfield, Barbra Streisand, and Stevie Wonder. Keys' music is influenced by vintage soul music rooted in gospel, while she heavily incorporates classical piano with R&B, jazz, blues and hip hop into her music. ''The Guardian'' noted that Keys is skilled at fusing the "ruff hip-hop rhythms she absorbed during her New York youth" into her "heartfelt, soulful R&B stylings". She began experimenting with other genres, including pop and rock, in her third studio album, ''As I Am'',|title=As I Am  Overview|last=Brown|first=Marisa|work=Allmusic|accessdate=November 2, 2010}} transitioning from neo soul to a 1980s and 1990s R&B sound with her fourth album, ''The Element of Freedom''. Patrick Huguenin of the ''New York Daily News'' stated that her incorporation of classical piano riffs contributed to her breakout success. ''Jet'' magazine stated she "thrives" by touching fans with "piano mastery, words and melodious voice". ''The Independent'' described her style as consisting of "crawling blues coupled with a hip-hop backbeat", noting that her lyrics "rarely stray from matters of the heart". ''The New York Times'' noted that Keys presents herself as a musician first, and lyrically, her songs "plunge into the unsettled domain of female identity in the hip-hop era, determined to work their way through conflicting imperatives", while she plays multiple roles in her songs, expressing loyalty, jealousy, rejection, sadness, desire, fear, uncertainty, and tenacity.

Keys has a three octave contralto vocal range. She can sing from B flat over an octave below middle C (B{{music|flat}}2) to soprano C (C6). Keys has been commended as having a strong, raw and impassioned voice, which was also thought to be "emotionally manufactured" at times and that she pushes her voice out of its natural range. Keys' lyrics have been called generic, revolving around generalities. Greg Kot of the ''Chicago Tribune'' felt that she "[pokes] around for multi-format hits rather than trying to project any sort of artistic vision". Conversely, Jon Pareles of ''Blender'' magazine stated that the musical composition of her songs makes up for lyrical weakness, while Gregory Stephen Tate of ''The Village Voice'' compared Keys' writing and production to 1970s music.

Keys is one of three female artists (along with Beyonce and Taylor Swift) included on ''Billboard'' magazine's list of the "Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters, 20002011" for writing songs that topped the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart.

Alicia became an avatar for millions of people, always remaining true to herself" in 2017. Rolling Stone considers ''Songs in a Minor'' to be in their "100 Greatest Albums", and its single "Fallin'" in their "100 greatest songs" of the 2000s decade.

Keys is the co-founder and Global Ambassador of Keep a Child Alive, a non-profit organization that provides medicine, orphan care, and social support to families with HIV and AIDS in Africa and India. Keys was born during a time when the AIDS epidemic was gaining a lot of attention in the United States. She was first affected by the HIV/AIDs crisis at 8 years old when her mother's friend died from the disease. She discovered first-hand the extensive impact of the AIDS epidemic years later when she visited South Africa, a trip that was the impetus to cofounding Keep a Child Alive. Keys had befriended AIDS activist Leigh Blake, who had reached out to her and helped raise her awareness to the global impact of HIV/AIDS. Keys and Leigh visited South African clinics with HIV-infected mothers and children, where Keys encountered the lack of resources and education on the disease present in the communities. Keys visited other African countries such as Uganda and Kenya to promote care for children affected by AIDS. Her work in Africa was documented in the documentary ''Alicia in Africa: Journey to the Motherland'' which was released in April 2008.

According to Keys, the Black Ball held in 2014 raised around 2.4million dollars. Keys and U2 lead singer Bono recorded a cover version of Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush's "Don't Give Up" to raise funds for Keep a Child Alive. Their version of the song was retitled "Don't Give Up (Africa)" to reflect the nature of the charity it was benefiting.

In May 2016, Keys initiated a #NoMakeup movement, where she wrote on ''Lenny'' "Before I started my new album, I wrote a list of all the things that I was sick of. And one was how much women are brainwashed into feeling like we have to be skinny, or sexy, or desirable, or perfect. One of the many things I was tired of was the constant judgment of women. The constant stereotyping through every medium that makes us feel like being a normal size is not normal, and heaven forbid if you're plus-size. Or the constant message that being sexy means being naked". Keys presented her movement at various events, and received a range of both complimentary and critical responses.

In July 2016, Keys participated in a video on taking action against systemic racism in the United States titled, "23 Ways You Could Be Killed if You are Black in America". After the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States in 2017, Keys protested during the Women's March on Washington. She was one of the key speakers, and she said that "we want the best for all Americans. No hate, no bigotry, no Muslim registry. We value education, health care, equality." She added that she cares about women's equal pay, war, women's rights, and environmental protection. Keys also sang a version of her hit song "Girl on Fire."

In Montral, on May 27, 2017, Alicia Keys received and shared the award for the Ambassador of Conscience 2017 from Amnesty International alongside Canadian Indigenous rights activists.
