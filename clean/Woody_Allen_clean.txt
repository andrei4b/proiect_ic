'''Heywood Allen'''  (born '''Allan Stewart Konigsberg'''; December 1, 1935) is an American director, writer, actor, comedian, and musician whose career spans more than six decades. He began his career as a comedy writer in the 1950s, writing jokes and scripts for television and publishing several books of short humor pieces. In the early 1960s, Allen began performing as a stand-up comedian, emphasizing monologues rather than traditional jokes. As a comedian, he developed the persona of an insecure, intellectual, fretful nebbish, which he maintains is quite different from his real-life personality.{{cite web|authorlink=Terry Gross|last=Gross|first= Terry|date=January 27, 2012|url= https://www.npr.org/2012/01/27/145760095/woody-allen-blending-real-life-with-fiction |title=Woody Allen: Blending Real Life With Fiction|work=Fresh Air|accessdate=April 7, 2012|archivedate= September 11, 2012| archiveurl=
https://archive.is/20120911075355/http://www.npr.org/2012/01/27/145760095/woody-allen-blending-real-life-with-fiction|deadurl=no}} In 2004, Comedy Central ranked Allen fourth on a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians, while a UK survey ranked Allen as the third-greatest comedian.

By the mid-1960s, Allen was writing and directing films, first specializing in slapstick comedies before moving into dramatic material influenced by European art cinema during the 1970s, and alternating between comedies and dramas to the present. He is often identified as part of the New Hollywood wave of filmmakers of the mid-1960s to late 1970s. Allen often stars in his films, typically in the persona he developed as a standup. Some of the best-known of his over 50films are ''Annie Hall'' (1977), ''Manhattan'' (1979), ''Hannah and Her Sisters'' (1986), and ''Crimes and Misdemeanors'' (1989). In 2007 he said ''Stardust Memories'' (1980), ''The Purple Rose of Cairo'' (1985), and ''Match Point'' (2005) were his best films. Critic Roger Ebert described Allen as "a treasure of the cinema".

Allen has received many accolades and honors throughout his career. He has won four Academy Awards: three for Best Original Screenplay and one for Best Director. He also garnered nine British Academy Film Awards. His screenplay for ''Annie Hall'' was named the funniest screenplay by the Writers Guild of America in its list of the "101 Funniest Screenplays".  In 2011, PBS televised the film biography ''Woody Allen: A Documentary'' on the ''American Masters'' TV series.

== Early life ==
thumb|left|Allen as a high school senior, 1953
Allen was born Allan Stewart Konigsberg in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, New York. He and his sister, Letty (b. 1943), were raised in Midwood, Brooklyn. He is the son of Nettie (ne Cherry; November 8, 1906  January 27, 2002), a bookkeeper at her family's delicatessen, and Martin Konigsberg (December 25, 1900  January 8, 2001), a jewelry engraver and waiter. His family was Jewish, and his grandparents immigrated to the US from Russia and Austria and spoke Yiddish, Hebrew, and German. Both of Allen's parents were born and raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.Lax, ''Woody Allen: A Biography'', pp. 12-13

His childhood was not particularly happy; his parents did not get along, and he had a rocky relationship with his stern, temperamental mother. Allen spoke German quite a bit in his early years. He would later joke that when he was young he was often sent to inter-faith summer camps. While attending Hebrew school for eight years, he went to Public School 99 (now the Isaac Asimov School for Science and Literature) and to Midwood High School, where he graduated in 1953.The principal of P.S. 99 was Mrs. Eudora Fletcher; Allen has used her name for characters in several of his films. At that time, he lived in an apartment at 968 East 14th Street.Woody Allen visits the house in [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2397619/ Weide's documentary] Unlike his comic persona, he was more interested in baseball than school and his strong arms ensured he was first to be picked for a team.
He impressed students with his extraordinary talent at card and magic tricks.

For pay, he wrote jokes (or "gags") for agent David O. Alber, who sold them to newspaper columnists. At the age of 17, he legally changed his name to Heywood Allen{{Britannica|16217}} and later began to call himself Woody Allen. According to Allen, his first published joke read: "Woody Allen says he ate at a restaurant that had O.P.S. prices over people's salaries." He was then earning more than both parents combined. After high school, he attended New York University, studying communication and film in 1953, before dropping out after failing the course "Motion Picture Production". He later briefly studied film at City College of New York in 1954, but did not finish the semester. Later, he taught himself, rather than in the classroom. He eventually taught at The New School. He also studied with writing teacher Lajos Egri.{{sup|p.74}}  His status before the Selective Service System was "4-F", a medical deferment, although he later claimed his actual status was "4-P, hostage".

== Career ==

=== Comedy writer ===
Allen began writing short jokes when he was 15, and the following year began sending them to various Broadway writers to see if they'd be interested in buying any. He also began going by the name "Woody Allen".{{rp|539}} One of those writers was Abe Burrows, coauthor of ''Guys and Dolls'', who wrote, "Wow! His stuff was dazzling." Burrows then wrote Allen letters of introduction to Sid Caesar, Phil Silvers, and Peter Lind Hayes, who immediately sent Allen a check for just the jokes Burrows included as samples.{{rp|541}}

As a result of the jokes Allen mailed to various writers, he was invited, then age 19, to join the NBC Writer's Development Program in 1955, followed by a job on ''The NBC Comedy Hour'' in Los Angeles. He was later hired as a full-time writer for humorist Herb Shriner, initially earning $25 a week. He began writing scripts for ''The Ed Sullivan Show'', ''The Tonight Show'', specials for Sid Caesar post-''Caesar's Hour'' (19541957), and other television shows.{{sup|p.111}} By the time he was working for Caesar, he was earning $1,500 a week; with Caesar, he worked alongside Danny Simon, whom Allen credits for helping form his writing style. In 1962 alone he estimated that he wrote twenty thousand jokes for various comics.{{rp|533}}

Allen also wrote for the  ''Candid Camera'' television show, and appeared in some episodes. Along with that show, he wrote jokes for the Buddy Hackett sitcom ''Stanley'' and ''The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom''. And in 1958 he cowrote a few Sid Caesar specials with Larry Gelbart.{{rp|542}} After writing for many of television's leading comedians and comedy shows, Allen was gaining the reputation for being a "genius", says composer Mary Rodgers. When given an assignment for a show he would leave and come back the next day with "reams of paper", according to producer Max Liebman.{{rp|542}} Similarly, after writing for Bob Hope, Hope called him "half a genius".{{rp|542}}

His daily writing routine could go as long as fifteen hours, and he could focus and write anywhere necessary. Dick Cavett was amazed at Allen's capacity to write: "He can go to a typewriter after breakfast and sit there until the sun sets and his head is pounding, interrupting work only for coffee and a brief walk, and then spend the whole evening working."{{rp|551}} When Allen wrote for other comedians, they would use eight out of ten of his jokes. When he began performing as a stand-up, he was much more selective, typically using only one out of ten jokes. He estimated that to prepare for a 30-minute show, he spent six months of intensive writing.{{rp|551}} He enjoyed writing, however, despite the work: "Nothing makes me happier than to tear open a ream of paper. And I can't wait to fill it! I love to do it."{{rp|551}}

Allen started writing short stories and cartoon captions for magazines such as ''The New Yorker''; he was inspired by the tradition of  ''New Yorker'' humorists S. J. Perelman, George S. Kaufman, Robert Benchley and Max Shulman, whose material he modernized.Daniele Luttazzi, preface to the Italian translation of Allen's trilogy ''Complete prose'', {{ISBN|978-88-452-3307-4}} p. 7 quote:  Retrieved December 1, 2010.Allen, W.

Allen has published four collections of his short pieces and plays. These are ''Getting Even'', ''Without Feathers'', ''Side Effects'', and ''Mere Anarchy''. His early comic fiction was heavily influenced by the zany, pun-ridden humour of S.J. Perelman. In 2010, Allen released digital spoken word versions of his four books, in which he reads 73 short story selections from his work and for which he was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.

=== Stand-up comedian ===
thumb|Allen in the 1960s
From 1960 to 1969, Allen performed as a stand-up comedian to supplement his comedy writing. His contemporaries during those years included Lenny Bruce, Shelley Berman, the team of Mike Nichols and Elaine May, and Mort Sahl, his personal favorite. Comedy historian Gerald Nachman notes that Allen, while not the first to do stand-up, would eventually have greater impact than all the others in the 1960s, and would redefine the meaning of stand-up comedy: "He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times."{{rp|525}}

After Allen was taken under the wing of his new manager, Jack Rollins, who had recently discovered Nichols and May, Rollins suggested he perform his written jokes as a stand-up. Allen was resistant at first, but after seeing Mort Sahl on stage, he felt safer to give it a try: "I'd never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me."{{rp|545}} Allen made his professional stage debut at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan in October 1960, where comedian Shelley Berman introduced him as a young television writer who would perform his own material.{{rp|545}}

His early stand-up shows with his different style of humor were not always well received or understood by his audiences. Unlike other comedians, Allen spoke to his audiences in a gentle and conversational style, often appearing to be searching for words, although his style was well rehearsed. He acted "normal", dressed casually, and made no attempt to project a stage "personality". And he did not improvise: "I put very little premium on improvisation," he told Studs Terkel.{{rp|532}} His jokes were created from life experiences, and typically presented with a dead serious demeanor which made them funnier: "I don't think my family liked me. They put a live teddy bear in my crib."{{rp|533}}

The subjects of his jokes were rarely topical, political or socially relevant. Unlike Bruce and Sahl, he did not discuss current events such as civil rights, women's rights, the Cold War, or Vietnam. And although he was described as a "classic nebbish", he did not tell Jewish jokes. Comedy screenwriter Larry Gelbart compared Allen's style to Elaine May: "He just styled himself completely after her," he said.{{rp|546}} Like Nichols and May, he often made fun of intellectuals.

Television talk show host Dick Cavett, who was among the minority who quickly appreciated Allen's unique style, recalls seeing the audience at the Blue Angel mostly ignore Allen's monologue: "I recognized immediately that there was no young comedian in the country in the same class with him for sheer brilliance of jokes, and I resented the fact that the audience was too dumb to realize what they were getting."{{rp|550}} It was his subdued stage presence, while initially unappreciated, that eventually became one of Allen's strongest traits, explains Nachman: "The utter absence of showbiz veneer and shtick was the best shtick any comedian had ever devised. This uneasy onstage naturalness became a trademark."{{rp|530}} When he was finally noticed by the media, writers like ''New York Times''{{'}} Arthur Gelb would describe Allen's nebbish quality as being "Chaplinesque" and "refreshing".

Allen developed an anxious, nervous, and intellectual persona for his stand-up act, a successful move that secured regular gigs for him in nightclubs and on television. Allen brought innovation to the comedy monologue genre and his stand-up comedy would be considered influential. Allen first appeared on ''The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'' on November 1, 1963 and over nine years his guest appearances included seventeen in the hosts chair. He subsequently released three LP albums of live nightclub recordings: the self-titled ''Woody Allen'' (1964), ''Volume 2'' (1965), and ''The Third Woody Allen Album'' (1968) recorded at a fund-raiser for Senator Eugene McCarthy's presidential run.

In 1965, Allen had his own TV special in Great Britain called ''The Woody Allen Show.''  In 1967 he hosted an episode of ''The Kraft Music Hall'' where he would intersperse humor with interviews of famous people, including conservative writer William F. Buckley.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=194zJ55LcVk Billy Graham on Woody Allen Show, 1967], 2-part video, 10 min.

He also performed stand-up comedy on other series including ''The Andy Williams Show'' and ''The Perry Como Show'' where he would interact with other guests and occasionally sing.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuCufsHa8wU Woody Allen performing on British TV], 1965 In 1971 Allen hosted one of his final ''Tonight Shows'', which included as guests Bob Hope and James Coco.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7SzaFF7KaY&t=42s Woody Allen guest hosts ''The Tonight Show''], 1971

=== Playwright ===
thumb|left|Allen with the Broadway cast of ''Play It Again, Sam'' (1969).
In 1966, Allen wrote the play ''Don't Drink the Water''. The play starred Lou Jacobi, Kay Medford, Anita Gillette and Allen's future movie co-star Tony Roberts. A film adaptation of the play, directed by Howard Morris, was released in 1969, starring Jackie Gleason. Because he was not particularly happy with the 1969 film version of his play, in 1994, Allen directed and starred in a second version for television, with Michael J. Fox and Mayim Bialik.

The next play Allen wrote for Broadway was ''Play It Again, Sam'', in which he also starred. The play opened on February 12, 1969, and ran for 453 performances. It featured Diane Keaton and Roberts. The play was significant to Keaton's budding career, and she has stated she was in "awe" of Allen even before auditioning for her role, which was the first time she met him. During an interview in 2013, Keaton stated that she "fell in love with him right away," adding, "I wanted to be his girlfriend so I did something about it."[http://www.netquake.net/2013/06/actress-diane-keaton-talks-about-woody-allen-her-career-and-personal-life/ "Actress Diane Keaton Talks About Woody Allen, Her Career and Personal Life"], ''Netquake'', June 2, 2013 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821202143/http://www.netquake.net/2013/06/actress-diane-keaton-talks-about-woody-allen-her-career-and-personal-life/ |date=August 21, 2016 }} After co-starring alongside Allen in the subsequent film version of ''Play It Again, Sam'', she would later co-star in ''Sleeper'', ''Love and Death'', ''Interiors'', ''Manhattan'' and ''Annie Hall''. "He showed me the ropes and I followed his lead. He is the most disciplined person I know. He works very hard," Keaton has stated. "I find the same thing sexy in a man now as I always have: humor. I love it when they are funny. It's to die for."

For its March 21, 1969, issue, ''Life'' featured Allen on its cover. In 1981, his play ''The Floating Light Bulb'' premiered on Broadway and ran for 65 performances. While receiving mixed reviews, it gave an autobiographical insight into Allen's childhood, specifically his fascination with magic tricks. He has written several one-act plays, including ''Riverside Drive'' and ''Old Saybrook'' exploring well-known Allen themes.

On October 20, 2011, Allen's one-act play ''Honeymoon Motel'' opened as part of a larger piece entitled ''Relatively Speaking'' on Broadway, with two other one-act plays, one by Ethan Coen and one by Elaine May.[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/theater/reviews/relatively-speaking-at-brooks-atkinson-theater-review.html "Each Family, Tortured in Its Own Way"] by Charles Isherwood, ''The New York Times'', October 20, 2011

=== Early films ===
His first movie was the Charles K. Feldman production ''What's New Pussycat?'' in 1965, for which he wrote the screenplay. He was disappointed with the final product, which inspired him to direct every film that he would later write. Allen's first directorial effort was ''What's Up, Tiger Lily?'' (1966, co-written with Mickey Rose), in which an existing Japanese spy movie''Kokusai himitsu keisatsu: Kagi no kagi'' (1965), "International Secret Police: Key of Keys"was redubbed in English by Allen and friends with fresh new, comic dialogue. In 1967, Allen played Jimmy Bond in the 007 spoof ''Casino Royale''.

Allen directed, starred in, and co-wrote (with Mickey Rose) ''Take the Money and Run'' in 1969, which received positive reviews. He later signed a deal with United Artists to produce several films. Those films eventually became ''Bananas'' (1971, co-written with Rose), ''Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex*'' (1972), ''Sleeper'' (1973), and ''Love and Death'' (1975). ''Sleeper'' was the first of four screenplays co-written by Allen and Marshall Brickman.

In 1972, Allen wrote and starred in the film version of ''Play It Again, Sam'', directed by Herbert Ross and co-starring Diane Keaton. In 1976, he starred as cashier Howard Prince, in ''The Front,'' directed by Martin Ritt. ''The Front'' was a humorous and poignant account of Hollywood blacklisting during the 1950s; Ritt, screenwriter Walter Bernstein, and three of Allen's cast-mates, Samuel "Zero" Mostel, Herschel Bernardi, and Lloyd Gough, had themselves been blacklisted.
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = MistyRose|quote=I don't like meeting heroes.

''Rolling Stone'', "A Conversation with the Real Woody Allen", July 1, 1976 pp. 34-40}}
Then came two of Allen's most popular films. ''Annie Hall'' won four Academy Awards in 1977, including Best Picture, Best Actress in a Leading Role for Diane Keaton, Best Original Screenplay and Best Director for Woody Allen. ''Annie Hall'' set the standard for modern romantic comedy and ignited a fashion trend with the clothes worn by Diane Keaton in the film. In an interview with journalist Katie Couric, Keaton does not deny that Allen wrote the part for her and about her.{{YouTube|blGicJHQZdo|"Annie Hall Interview with Diane Keaton by Katie Couric"}}, video interview, 2 min. She also explains that Allen wrote the part based on aspects of her personality at the time:

{{quote|Of course I recognized myself in the roles [Woody Allen] wrote. I mean, in ''Annie Hall'' (1977) particularly. I was this sort of novice who had lots of feelings but didn't know how to express herself, and I see that in Annie. I think Woody used a kind of essential quality that he found in me at that time, and I'm glad he did because it worked really well in the movie.[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000473/bio#quotes Personal quotes by Diane Keaton], Internet Movie Database}}

The film is ranked at No. 35 on the ''American Film Institute''{{'s}} "100 Best Movies" and at No. 4 on the AFI list of "100 Best Comedies."

''Manhattan'' (1979), is a black-and-white film often viewed as an homage to New York City. As in many Allen films, the main protagonists are upper-middle class writers and academics. The love{{endash}}hate opinion of cerebral persons found in ''Manhattan'' is characteristic of many of Allen's movies, including ''Crimes and Misdemeanors'' and ''Annie Hall.'' ''Manhattan'' focuses on the complicated relationship between middle-aged Isaac Davis (Allen) with 17-year-old Tracy (Mariel Hemingway), and co-stars Diane Keaton.

Keaton, who made eight movies with Allen during her career, tries to explain why his films are unique:
{{quote|He just has a mind like nobody else. He's bold. He's got a lot of strength, a lot of courage in terms of his work. And that is what it takes to do something really unique. Along with a genius imagination.}}

Between ''Annie Hall'' and ''Manhattan'', Allen wrote and directed the dark drama ''Interiors'' (1978),{{Citation|title=Interiors|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/interiors/|language=en|accessdate=2018-02-27}} in the style of Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, one of Allen's chief influences. ''Interiors'' represented a departure from Allen's "early, funny" comedies (a line from 1980's ''Stardust Memories'').

=== 1980s ===
Allen's 1980s films, even the comedies, have somber and philosophical undertones, with their influences being the works of European directors, specifically Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini. ''Stardust Memories'' was based on ''8'', which it parodies, and ''Wild Strawberries''. ''A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy'' was adapted from ''Smiles of a Summer Night''. In ''Hannah and Her Sisters'', part of the film's structure and background is borrowed from ''Fanny and Alexander''. ''Amarcord'' inspired ''Radio Days''. ''September'' resembles ''Autumn Sonata''. Allen uses many elements from ''Wild Strawberries''. In ''Crimes and Misdemeanors'', Allen references a scene from ''Wild Strawberries''.

''Stardust Memories'' (1980) features Sandy Bates, a successful filmmaker played by Allen, who expresses resentment and scorn for his fans. Overcome by the recent death of a friend from illness, the character states, "I don't want to make funny movies any more" and a running gag has various people (including visiting space aliens) telling Bates that they appreciate his films, "especially the early, funny ones." Allen believes this to be one of his best films.

{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = LightCyan|quote=Mia's a good actress who can play many different roles. She has a very good range, and can play serious to comic roles. She's also very photogenic, very beautiful on screen. She's just a good realistic actress... and no matter how strange and daring it is, she does it well.|source=Woody Allen (1993)Allen, Woody. ''Woody Allen on Woody Allen'', Grove Press (1993) p. 133}}
''A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy'' (1982) was the first of 13 movies Allen made starring Mia Farrow, who stepped into Diane Keaton's role when Keaton was shooting ''Reds''. He next produced a vividly idiosyncratic tragi-comical parody of documentary, ''Zelig'', in which he starred as a Leonard Zelig, man who has the ability to transform his appearance to that of the people who surround him.

Allen has combined tragic and comic elements in such films as ''Hannah and Her Sisters'' (1986) and ''Crimes and Misdemeanors'' (1989), in which he tells two stories that connect at the end. He also made three films about show business: ''Broadway Danny Rose'', in which he plays a New York show business agent, ''The Purple Rose of Cairo'', a movie that shows the importance of the cinema during the Depression through the character of the naive Cecilia, and ''Radio Days'', a film about his childhood in Brooklyn and the importance of the radio. The film co-starred Farrow in a part Allen wrote specifically for her.

''The Purple Rose of Cairo'' was named by ''Time'' as one of the 100 best films of all time and Allen described it as one of his three best films, along with ''Stardust Memories'' and ''Match Point''{{cite web

}} (Allen defines them as "best" not in terms of quality but because they came closest to his vision). In 1989, Allen teamed with directors Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese to make ''New York Stories'', an anthology film about New Yorkers. Allen's short, ''Oedipus Wrecks'', is about a neurotic lawyer and his critical mother. His short pleased critics, but ''New York Stories'' bombed at the box office.

=== 1990s ===
His 1991 film ''Shadows and Fog'' is a black-and-white homage to the German expressionists and features the music of Kurt Weill. Allen then made his critically acclaimed comedy-drama ''Husbands and Wives'' (1992), which received two Oscar nominations: Best Supporting Actress for Judy Davis and Best Original Screenplay for Allen. His film ''Manhattan Murder Mystery'' (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of Diane Keaton, Alan Alda and Anjelica Huston.

He returned to lighter movies like ''Bullets over Broadway'' (1994), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, followed by a musical, ''Everyone Says I Love You'' (1996). The singing and dancing scenes in ''Everyone Says I Love You'' are similar to musicals starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The comedy ''Mighty Aphrodite'' (1995), in which Greek drama plays a large role, won an Academy Award for Mira Sorvino. Allen's 1999 jazz-based comedy-drama ''Sweet and Lowdown'' was nominated for two Academy Awards for Sean Penn (Best Actor) and Samantha Morton (Best Supporting Actress). In contrast to these lighter movies, Allen veered into darker satire toward the end of the decade with ''Deconstructing Harry'' (1997) and ''Celebrity'' (1998).

During this decade, Allen also starred in the television film ''The Sunshine Boys'' (1995), based on the Neil Simon play of the same name.

Allen made one sitcom "appearance" via telephone on the show ''Just Shoot Me!'' in a 1997 episode, "My Dinner with Woody", which paid tribute to several of his films. Allen provided the voice of Z in DreamWorks' first animated film, ''Antz'' (1998), which featured many actors he had worked with; Allen's character was similar to his earlier neurotic roles.

=== 2000s ===
''Small Time Crooks'' (2000) was Allen's first film with the DreamWorks studio and represented a change in direction: Allen began giving more interviews and made an attempt to return to his slapstick roots. The film is similar to the 1942 film ''Larceny, Inc.'' (from a play by S.J. Perelman).Robert Osborne of Turner Classic Movies on June 15, 2006 Allen never commented on whether this was deliberate or if his film was in any way inspired by it. ''Small Time Crooks'' was a relative financial success, grossing over $17 million domestically but Allen's next four films foundered at the box office, including Allen's most costly film, ''The Curse of the Jade Scorpion'' (with a budget of $26 million). ''Hollywood Ending'', ''Anything Else'', and ''Melinda and Melinda'' were given "rotten" ratings from film-review website Rotten Tomatoes and each earned less than $4 million domestically. Some critics claimed that Allen's early 2000s films were subpar and expressed concern that Allen's best years were behind him. Others were less harsh; reviewing the little-liked ''Melinda and Melinda'', Roger Ebert wrote, "I cannot escape the suspicion that if Woody had never made a previous film, if each new one was Woody's Sundance debut, it would get a better reception. His reputation is not a dead shark but an albatross, which with admirable economy Allen has arranged for the critics to carry around their own necks." Woody gave his godson Quincy Rose a small part in ''Melinda and Melinda''.

Allen was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2001.

''Match Point'' (2005) was one of Allen's most successful films of the decade, garnering positive reviews. Set in London, it starred Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Scarlett Johansson. It is markedly darker than Allen's first four films with DreamWorks SKG. In ''Match Point'', Allen shifted focus from the intellectual upper class of New York to the moneyed upper class of London. The film earned more than $23 million domestically (more than any of his films in nearly 20 years) and over $62 million in international box office sales. ''Match Point'' earned Allen his first Academy Award nomination since 1998, for Best Writing Original Screenplay, with directing and writing nominations at the Golden Globes, his first Globe nominations since 1987. In a 2006 interview with ''Premiere Magazine'', Allen stated this was the best film he has ever made.

Allen returned to London to film ''Scoop'', which also starred Johansson, Hugh Jackman, Ian McShane, Kevin McNally and Allen himself. The film was released on July 28, 2006, and received mixed reviews. He filmed ''Cassandra's Dream'' in London. ''Cassandra's Dream'' was released in November 2007, and stars Colin Farrell, Ewan McGregor and Tom Wilkinson.

After finishing his third London film, Allen headed to Spain. He reached an agreement to film ''Vicky Cristina Barcelona'' in Avils, Barcelona and Oviedo, where shooting started on July 9, 2007. The movie stars Scarlett Johansson, Javier Bardem, Rebecca Hall and Penlope Cruz. Speaking of his experience there, Allen said: "I'm delighted at being able to work with Mediapro and make a film in Spain, a country which has become so special to me." ''Vicky Cristina Barcelona'' was well received, winning Best Motion Picture  Musical or Comedy at the Golden Globe awards. Penlope Cruz received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the film.

Allen has said that he "survives" on the European market. Audiences there tend to be more receptive to his films, particularly in Spain, France and Italycountries where he has a large audience (joked about in ''Hollywood Ending''). "In the United States things have changed a lot, and it's hard to make good small films now," Allen said in a 2004 interview. "The avaricious studios couldn't care less about good filmsif they get a good film they're twice as happy but money-making films are their goal. They only want these $100 million pictures that make $500 million."

=== Theatre ===
thumb|upright|left|Life-size statue of Woody Allen in Oviedo, Spain
While best known for his films, Allen has enjoyed a successful career in theatre, starting as early as 1960, when he wrote sketches for the revue ''From A to Z''. His first great success was ''Don't Drink the Water'', which opened in 1968, and ran for 598 performances for almost two years on Broadway. His success continued with ''Play It Again, Sam'', which opened in 1969, starring Allen and Diane Keaton. The show played for 453 performances and was nominated for three Tony Awards, although none of the nominations were for Allen's writing or acting.

In the 1970s, Allen wrote a number of one-act plays, most notably ''God'' and ''Death'', which were published in his 1975 collection ''Without Feathers''. In 1981, Allen's play ''The Floating Light Bulb'' opened on Broadway. The play was a critical success and a commercial flop. Despite two Tony Award nominations, a Tony win for the acting of Brian Backer (who won the 1981 Theater World Award and a Drama Desk Award for his work), the play only ran for 62 performances. After a long hiatus from the stage, Allen returned to the theatre in 1995, with the one-act ''Central Park West'', an installment in an evening of theatre known as ''Death Defying Acts'' that was also made up of new work by David Mamet and Elaine May.

For the next few years, Allen had no direct involvement with the stage, yet notable productions of his work were staged. A production of ''God'' was staged at The Bank of Brazil Cultural Center in Rio de Janeiro, and theatrical adaptations of Allen's films ''Bullets Over Broadway'' and ''September'' were produced in Italy and France, respectively, without Allen's involvement. In 1997, rumors of Allen returning to the theatre to write a starring role for his wife Soon-Yi Previn turned out to be false. In 2003, Allen finally returned to the stage with ''Writer's Block'', an evening of two one-acts''Old Saybrook'' and ''Riverside Drive''that played Off-Broadway. The production marked the stage-directing debut for Allen. The production sold out the entire run. Also in 2003, reports of Allen writing the book for a musical based on ''Bullets Over Broadway'' surfaced, and it opened in New York in 2014. The musical closed on August 24, 2014, after 156 performances and 33 previews.Gans, Andrew and Hetrick, Adam.

=== Music ===
thumb|Woody Allen with Jerry Zigmont and Simon Wettenhall performing at Vienne Jazz Festival, [[Vienne, Isre|Vienne, France, September 20, 2003]] Allen is a passionate fan of jazz, featured prominently in the soundtracks to his films. He began playing the clarinet as a child and took his stage name from clarinetist Woody Herman. He has performed publicly at least since the late 1960s, notably with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band on the soundtrack of ''Sleeper''. One of his earliest televised performances was on ''The Dick Cavett Show'' on October 20, 1971.

Woody Allen and his New Orleans Jazz Band have been playing each Monday evening at Manhattan's Carlyle Hotel for many years (as of 2011, specializing in classic New Orleans jazz from the early twentieth century). He plays songs by Sidney Bechet, George Lewis, Johnny Dodds, Jimmie Noone and Louis Armstrong.[http://www.monacomatin.mc/monaco/woody-allen-en-concert-ce-lundi-a-monaco.2042388.html Woody Allen en concert ce lundi  Monaco] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016052359/http://www.monacomatin.mc/monaco/woody-allen-en-concert-ce-lundi-a-monaco.2042388.html |date=October 16, 2015 }}, ''Monaco-Matin'', December 28, 2014 The documentary film ''Wild Man Blues'' (directed by Barbara Kopple) documents a 1996 European tour by Allen and his band, as well as his relationship with Previn. The band has released two CDs: ''The Bunk Project'' (1993) and the soundtrack of ''Wild Man Blues'' (1997). In a 2011 review of a concert by Allen's jazz band, critic Kirk Silsbee of the ''L.A. Times'' suggested that Allen should be regarded as a competent musical hobbyist with a sincere appreciation for early jazz: "Allen's clarinet won't make anyone forget Sidney Bechet, Barney Bigard or Evan Christopher. His piping tone and strings of staccato notes can't approximate melodic or lyrical phrasing. Still his earnestness and the obvious regard he has for traditional jazz counts for something."Silsbee, Kirk (December 30, 2011).

Allen and his band played the Montreal International Jazz Festival on two consecutive nights in June 2008. For many years, Allen wanted to make a film about the origins of jazz in New Orleans. The film, tentatively titled ''American Blues'', would follow the vastly different careers of Louis Armstrong and Sidney Bechet. Allen stated that the film would cost between $80 and $100million and is therefore unlikely to be made.Lax, Eric; Allen, Woody (2007).

== Personal life ==
Allen was married three times, to Harlene Rosen (m. 19561959), Louise Lasser (m. 19661970) and Soon-Yi Previn (m. 1997present). He also had a 12-year relationship with actor Mia Farrow and relationships with Stacey Nelkin and Diane Keaton.

===Early marriages and relationships===
Allen married 17-year-old Harlene Rosen when he was 20 in 1956; the marriage lasted until 1959. Rosen, whom Allen referred to in his standup act as "the Dread Mrs. Allen", sued him for defamation as a result of comments he made during a television appearance shortly after their divorce. In his mid-1960s standup album ''Standup Comic'', Allen said that Rosen had sued him because of a joke he made in an interview. Rosen had been sexually assaulted outside her apartment. According to Allen, the newspapers reported that she had been "violated". In the interview, Allen said, "Knowing my ex-wife, it probably wasn't a moving violation." In an interview on ''The Dick Cavett Show'', Allen repeated his comments and said he had been sued for "$1million."

Allen married Louise Lasser in 1966. They divorced in 1970. Lasser appeared in three Allen films shortly before and after the divorce''Take the Money and Run'', ''Bananas'', and ''Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)''and later briefly appeared in ''Stardust Memories''. In 1969 Allen cast Diane Keaton in his Broadway show, ''Play It Again, Sam.'' During the run she and Allen became romantically involved. Although they broke up after a year, she continued to star in his films, including ''Sleeper'' as a futuristic poet and ''Love and Death'' as a composite character based on the novels of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. ''Annie Hall'' was very important in Allen's and Keaton's careers. It is said that the role was written for her, as Diane Keaton's birth name was Diane Hall. She then starred in ''Interiors'' as a poet, followed by ''Manhattan''. In 1987, she had a cameo as a nightclub singer in ''Radio Days'', and she was chosen to replace Mia Farrow in ''Manhattan Murder Mystery'' after Allen and Farrow began having problems with their relationship. As of 2004 Keaton and Allen remained close friends.[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/02/18/48hours/main600975.shtml Q&A: Diane Keaton]. CBS News. February 18, 2004.

The film ''Manhattan'' is said by the ''Los Angeles Times''{{dead link|date=June 2015}}  to be widely known to have been based on Allen's romantic relationship with actor Stacey Nelkin. Her bit part in ''Annie Hall'' ended up on the cutting room floor, and their relationship, although never publicly acknowledged by Allen, reportedly began when she was 17 and a student at New York's Stuyvesant High School.Fox, Julian (1996).

=== Mia Farrow  ===
Allen and Mia Farrow met in 1979 and began a 12-year relationship in 1980; Farrow starred in 13 of Allen's films from 1982 to 1992. Throughout the relationship they lived in separate apartments on opposite sides of Central Park in Manhattan. Farrow had seven children when they met; there were three biological sons from her marriage to composer Andr Previn, three adopted girls (two Vietnamese and one Korean, Soon-Yi Previn), and one adopted Korean boy, Moses Farrow.{{cite news | title=Woody and Mia: A New York Story |author=Lax, Eric |newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 24, 1991.

In 1984 she and Allen tried to have a biological child together; Allen agreed to this on the understanding that he need not be involved in the child's care. When the effort to get pregnant failed, Farrow adopted a baby girl, Dylan Farrow, in July 1985. Allen was not involved in the adoption, but when Dylan arrived he assumed a parental role toward her and began spending more time in Farrow's home. On December 19, 1987, Farrow gave birth to Allen's biological child, Satchel Farrow (later known as Ronan Farrow). In 1991 Farrow wanted to adopt another child. According to a 1993 custody hearing, Allen told her he would not object to another adoption so long as she would agree to his adoption of Dylan and Moses; that adoption was finalized in December 1991. Eric Lax, Allen's biographer, wrote in ''The New York Times'' in February 1991 that Allen was "there before they [the children] wake up in the morning, he sees them during the day and he helps put them to bed at night".

===Soon-Yi Previn===
thumb|Soon-Yi Previn and Allen, 2009
In 1978 Farrow and Andr Previn adopted Soon-Yi Previn, who had been abandoned in the slums of Seoul. At the time of the adoption, her passport said that she was seven; a bone scan in the US reportedly determined that she was between five and seven.{{efn|Maureen Orth (''Vanity Fair'', November 1992): "Nobody knows how old Soon-Yi really is. Without ever seeing her, Korean officials put her age down as seven on her passport. A bone scan Mia had done on her in the U.S. put her age at between five and seven. In the family, Soon-Yi is considered to have turned 20 this year [1992], on October 8.}} Living with Farrow, Soon-Yi is said to have had little contact with Allen until 1990, when she asked to accompany him to a basketball game. They attended more games together and by 1991 had become closer. In September 1991 she began her studies at Drew University in New Jersey.

In January 1992, Farrow found nude photographs of 22-year-old Soon-Yi in Allen's home. Allen, then 57, told Farrow that he had taken them the day before, around two weeks after he first had sex with Soon-Yi. This resulted in a bitter breakup of Farrow's and Allen's relationship; both parties instructed lawyers shortly after the photographs were discovered. That summer, Soon-Yi was asked to leave summer camp because she was spending too much time taking calls from a "Mr. Simon", who turned out to be Allen. Allen issued a statement on August 17, 1992, saying that he was in love with Soon-Yi. They were married in Venice on December 23, 1997, and adopted two children, Bechet and Manzie. They live in the Carnegie Hill section of Manhattan's Upper East Side.Thurman, Judith (November 2008).

=== Assault allegation===
{{main|Woody Allen sexual assault allegation}}
According to court testimony, on August 4, 1992, Allen visited the children at Mia Farrow's home in Bridgewater, Connecticut, while she was out shopping with a friend. The following day, that friend's babysitter told her employer that she had seen Allen behaving inappropriately with Dylan. When Farrow asked Dylan about it, Dylan alleged that Allen had touched Dylan's "private part" while they were alone together in the attic. One woman employed to care for Farrow's children said that for about 20 minutes that afternoon she had not known where Dylan was, while a second said that, at one point, Dylan had been wearing no underwear under her dress. Farrow told Dylan's pediatrician, who informed authorities.

After being told about the allegation, Allen began proceedings in New York Supreme Court for sole custody of his and Farrow's biological son, Satchel, as well as Dylan and Moses, the two adopted children of Farrow that Allen had adopted as well. He strongly denied the allegation, calling it "an unconscionable and gruesomely damaging manipulation of innocent children for vindictive and self-serving motives". A months-long investigation by the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic of YaleNew Haven Hospital concluded that Dylan had not been sexually assaulted.{{pb}}
 In June 1993 the judge rejected Allen's bid for custody. He said that the YaleNew Haven team's unwillingness to testify in court, except through a deposition, together with the destruction of its notes, had rendered its report "sanitized and, therefore, less credible". In September that year the state prosecutor announced that he would not pursue charges.{{ cite news |first=Melinda|last=Henneberger|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/25/nyregion/connecticut-prosecutor-won-t-file-charges-against-woody-allen.html | title = Connecticut Prosecutor Won't File Charges Against Woody Allen | work = The New York Times | date = September 25, 1993}} On May 23, 2018, a blog post by Moses Farrow, the son of Woody Allen and Mia Farrow, defended Allen against the allegations leveled against him by Mia and Dylan Farrow.

== Works about Allen ==
Apart from ''Wild Man Blues'', directed by Barbara Kopple, there are other documentaries featuring Woody Allen, including the 2001 cable-television documentary ''Woody Allen: a Life in Film'', directed by ''Time'' film critic Richard Schickel, which interlaces interviews of Allen with clips of his films, and ''Meetin' WA'', a short interview of Allen by French director Jean-Luc Godard. In 2011 the PBS series American Masters co-produced the documentary ''Woody Allen: a Documentary'', directed by Robert B. Weide.

Eric Lax authored the book ''Woody Allen: A Biography''. From 1976 to 1984, Stuart Hample wrote and drew ''Inside Woody Allen'', a comic strip based on Allen's film persona.
