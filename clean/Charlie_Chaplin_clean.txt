'''Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin''', {{post-nominals|size=100%|country=GBR|KBE}} (16 April 1889  25 December 1977) was an English  comic actor, filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in the era of silent film. Chaplin became a worldwide icon through his screen persona "the Tramp" and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the film industry.{{sfnm|1a1=Cousins||1p=72|2a1=Kemp|2pp=8, 22|3a1=Gunning|3p=41|4a1=Sarris|4p=139|5a1=Hansmeyer|5p=3}} His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the Victorian era until a year before his death in 1977, and encompassed both adulation and controversy.

Chaplin's childhood in London was one of poverty and hardship. As his father was absent and his mother struggled financially, he was sent to a workhouse twice before the age of nine. When he was 14, his mother was committed to a mental asylum. Chaplin began performing at an early age, touring music halls and later working as a stage actor and comedian. At 19, he was signed to the prestigious Fred Karno company, which took him to America. Chaplin was scouted for the film industry and began appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios. He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base. Chaplin directed his own films from an early stage and continued to hone his craft as he moved to the Essanay, Mutual, and First National corporations. By 1918, he was one of the best-known figures in the world.

In 1919, Chaplin co-founded the distribution company United Artists, which gave him complete control over his films. His first feature-length was ''The Kid'' (1921), followed by ''A Woman of Paris'' (1923), ''The Gold Rush'' (1925), and ''The Circus'' (1928). He refused to move to sound films in the 1930s, instead producing ''City Lights'' (1931) and ''Modern Times'' (1936) without dialogue. Chaplin became increasingly political, and his next film, ''The Great Dictator'' (1940), satirised Adolf Hitler. The 1940s were a decade marked with controversy for Chaplin, and his popularity declined rapidly. He was accused of communist sympathies, while his involvement in a paternity suit and marriages to much younger women caused scandal. An FBI investigation was opened, and Chaplin was forced to leave the United States and settle in Switzerland. He abandoned the Tramp in his later films, which include ''Monsieur Verdoux'' (1947), ''Limelight'' (1952), ''A King in New York'' (1957), and ''A Countess from Hong Kong'' (1967).

Chaplin wrote, directed, produced, edited, starred in, and composed the music for most of his films. He was a perfectionist, and his financial independence enabled him to spend years on the development and production of a picture. His films are characterised by slapstick combined with pathos, typified in the Tramp's struggles against adversity. Many contain social and political themes, as well as autobiographical elements. In 1972, as part of a renewed appreciation for his work, Chaplin received an Honorary Academy Award for "the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century". He continues to be held in high regard, with ''The Gold Rush'', ''City Lights'', ''Modern Times'', and ''The Great Dictator'' often ranked on industry lists of the greatest films of all time.

===18891913: Early years===

====Background and childhood hardship====
Charles Spencer Chaplin was born on 16 April 1889 to Hannah Chaplin (born Hannah Harriet Pedlingham Hill) and Charles Chaplin Sr. There is no official record of his birth, although Chaplin believed he was born at East Street, Walworth, in South London.{{sfn|Robinson|p=10}}{{refn|An MI5 investigation in 1952 was unable to find any record of Chaplin's birth. Chaplin biographer David Robinson notes that it is not surprising that his parents failed to register the birth: "It was easy enough, particularly for music hall artists, constantly moving (if they were lucky) from one town to another, to put off and eventually forget this kind of formality; at that time the penalties were not strict or efficiently enforced."{{sfn|Robinson|p=10}} In 2011 a letter sent to Chaplin in the 1970s came to light which claimed that he had been born in a Gypsy caravan at Black Patch Park in Smethwick, Staffordshire. Chaplin's son Michael has suggested that the information must have been significant to his father in order for him to retain the letter. Regarding the date of his birth, Chaplin believed it to be 16 April, but an announcement in the 11 May 1889 edition of ''The Magnet'' stated it as the 15th.{{sfn|Robinson|p=xxiv}}|group=note}} His mother and father had married four years previously, at which time Charles Sr. became the legal carer of Hannah's illegitimate son, Sydney John Hill.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=34, 19}}{{refn|Sydney was born when Hannah Chaplin was 19. The identity of his biological father is not known for sure, but Hannah claimed it was a Mr. Hawkes.{{sfn|Robinson|p=3}}|group=note}} At the time of his birth, Chaplin's parents were both music hall entertainers. Hannah, the daughter of a shoemaker,{{sfn|Robinson|p=3}} had a brief and unsuccessful career under the stage name Lily Harley,{{sfn|Robinson|pp=57}} while Charles Sr., a butcher's son,{{sfn|Weissman|(2009)|p=10}} was a popular singer.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=910, 12}} Although they never divorced, Chaplin's parents were estranged by around 1891.{{sfn|Robinson|p=13}} The following year, Hannah gave birth to a third son  George Wheeler Dryden  fathered by the music hall entertainer Leo Dryden. The child was taken by Dryden at six months old, and did not re-enter Chaplin's life for 30 years.{{sfn|Robinson|p=15}}

Chaplin's childhood was fraught with poverty and hardship, making his eventual trajectory "the most dramatic of all the rags to riches stories ever told" according to his authorised biographer David Robinson.{{sfn|Robinson|p=xv}} Chaplin's early years were spent with his mother and brother Sydney in the London district of Kennington; Hannah had no means of income, other than occasional nursing and dressmaking, and Chaplin Sr. provided no financial support.{{sfn|Robinson|p=16}} As the situation deteriorated, Chaplin was sent to Lambeth Workhouse when he was seven years old.{{refn|Hannah became ill in May 1896, and was admitted to hospital. Southwark Council ruled that it was necessary to send the children to a workhouse "owing to the absence of their father and the destitution and illness of their mother".{{sfn|Robinson|p=19}}|group=note}} The council housed him at the Central London District School for paupers, which Chaplin remembered as "a forlorn existence".{{sfn|Chaplin|p=29}} He was briefly reunited with his mother 18 months later, before Hannah was forced to readmit her family to the workhouse in July 1898. The boys were promptly sent to Norwood Schools, another institution for destitute children.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=2426}}

In September 1898, Hannah was committed to Cane Hill mental asylum  she had developed a psychosis seemingly brought on by an infection of syphilis and malnutrition.{{sfn|Weissman|(2009)|pp=4950}} For the two months she was there, Chaplin and his brother Sydney were sent to live with their father, whom the young boys scarcely knew.{{sfn|Chaplin|pp=15, 33}} Charles Sr. was by then a severe alcoholic, and life there was bad enough to provoke a visit from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.{{sfn|Robinson|p=27}} Chaplin's father died two years later, at 38 years old, from cirrhosis of the liver.{{sfn|Robinson|p=36}}

Hannah entered a period of remission but, in May 1903, became ill again.{{sfn|Robinson|p=27}} Chaplin, then 14, had the task of taking his mother to the infirmary, from where she was sent back to Cane Hill.{{sfn|Robinson|p=40}} He lived alone for several days, searching for food and occasionally sleeping rough, until Sydney  who had enrolled in the Navy two years earlier  returned.{{sfnm|1a1=Weissman|1y=(2009)|1p=6|2a1=Chaplin|2pp=7174|3a1=Robinson|3p=35}} Hannah was released from the asylum eight months later,{{sfn|Robinson|p=41}} but in March 1905, her illness returned, this time permanently. "There was nothing we could do but accept poor mother's fate", Chaplin later wrote, and she remained in care until her death in 1928.{{sfnm|1a1=Chaplin|1p=88|2a1=Robinson|2pp=5556}}

====Young performer====

Between his time in the poor schools and his mother succumbing to mental illness, Chaplin began to perform on stage. He later recalled making his first amateur appearance at the age of five years, when he took over from Hannah one night in Aldershot.{{refn|According to Chaplin, Hannah had been booed off stage, and the manager chose him  as he was standing in the wings  to go on as her replacement. He remembered confidently entertaining the crowd, and receiving laughter and applause.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=17|2a1=Chaplin|2p=18}}|group=note}} This was an isolated occurrence, but by the time he was nine Chaplin had, with his mother's encouragement, grown interested in performing. He later wrote: "[she] imbued me with the feeling that I had some sort of talent".{{sfn|Chaplin|p=41}} Through his father's connections,{{sfn|Marriot|p=4}} Chaplin became a member of the Eight Lancashire Lads clog-dancing troupe, with whom he toured English music halls throughout 1899 and 1900.{{refn|The Eight Lancashire Lads were still touring until 1908; the exact time Chaplin left the group is unverified, but based on research, A. J. Marriot believes it was in December 1900.{{sfn|Marriot|p=213}}|group=note}} Chaplin worked hard, and the act was popular with audiences, but he was not satisfied with dancing and wished to form a comedy act.{{sfn|Chaplin|p=44}}

In the years Chaplin was touring with the Eight Lancashire Lads, his mother ensured that he still attended school but, by age 13, he had abandoned education.{{sfn|Louvish|p=19}}{{sfn|Robinson|p=39}} He supported himself with a range of jobs, while nursing his ambition to become an actor.{{sfn|Chaplin|p=76}} At 14, shortly after his mother's relapse, he registered with a theatrical agency in London's West End. The manager sensed potential in Chaplin, who was promptly given his first role as a newsboy in Harry Arthur Saintsbury's ''Jim, a Romance of Cockayne''.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=4446}} It opened in July 1903, but the show was unsuccessful and closed after two weeks. Chaplin's comic performance, however, was singled out for praise in many of the reviews.{{sfnm|1a1=Marriot|1pp=4244|2a1=Robinson|2pp=4647|3a1=Louvish|3p=26}}

Saintsbury secured a role for Chaplin in Charles Frohman's production of ''Sherlock Holmes'', where he played Billy the pageboy in three nationwide tours.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=45, 4951, 53, 58}} His performance was so well received that he was called to London to play the role alongside William Gillette, the original Holmes.{{refn|William Gillette co-wrote the ''Sherlock Holmes'' play with Arthur Conan Doyle, and had been starring in it since its New York opening in 1899. He had come to London in 1905 to appear in a new play, ''Clarice''. Its reception was poor, and Gillette decided to add an "after-piece" called ''The Painful Predicament of Sherlock Holmes''. This short play was what Chaplin originally came to London to appear in. After three nights, Gillette chose to close ''Clarice'' and replace it with ''Sherlock Holmes''. Chaplin had so pleased Gillette with his performance in ''The Painful Predicament'' that he was kept on as Billy for the full play.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=5960}}|group=note}} "It was like tidings from heaven", Chaplin recalled.{{sfn|Chaplin|p=89}} At 16 years old, Chaplin starred in the play's West End production at the Duke of York's Theatre from October to December 1905.{{sfn|Marriot|p=217}} He completed one final tour of ''Sherlock Holmes'' in early 1906, before leaving the play after more than two-and-a-half years.{{sfn|Robinson|p=63}}

====Stage comedy and vaudeville====
Chaplin soon found work with a new company, and went on tour with his brother  who was also pursuing an acting career  in a comedy sketch called ''Repairs''.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=6364}} In May 1906, Chaplin joined the juvenile act ''Casey's Circus'',{{sfn|Marriot|p=71}} where he developed popular burlesque pieces and was soon the star of the show. By the time the act finished touring in July 1907, the 18-year-old had become an accomplished comedic performer.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1pp=6468|2a1=Chaplin|2p=94}} He struggled to find more work, however, and a brief attempt at a solo act was a failure.{{refn|Chaplin attempted to be a "Jewish comedian", but the act was poorly received and he performed it only once.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=68|2a1=Marriot|2pp=8184}}|group=note}}

Meanwhile, Sydney Chaplin had joined Fred Karno's prestigious comedy company in 1906 and, by 1908, he was one of their key performers.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=71|2a1=Kamin|2p=12|3a1=Marriot|3p=85}} In February, he managed to secure a two-week trial for his younger brother. Karno was initially wary, and considered Chaplin a "pale, puny, sullen-looking youngster" who "looked much too shy to do any good in the theatre."{{sfn|Robinson|p=76}} However, the teenager made an impact on his first night at the London Coliseum and he was quickly signed to a contract.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=7677}} Chaplin began by playing a series of minor parts, eventually progressing to starring roles in 1909.{{sfn|Marriot|pp=103, 109}} In April 1910, he was given the lead in a new sketch, ''Jimmy the Fearless''. It was a big success, and Chaplin received considerable press attention.{{sfnm|1a1=Marriot|1pp=126128|2a1=Robinson|2pp=8485}}

Karno selected his new star to join the section of the company, one that also included Stan Laurel, that toured North America's vaudeville circuit.{{sfn|Robinson|p=88}} The young comedian headed the show and impressed reviewers, being described as "one of the best pantomime artists ever seen here".{{sfn|Robinson|pp=9192}} His most successful role was a drunk called the "Inebriate Swell", which drew him significant recognition.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=82|2a1=Brownlow|2p=98}} The tour lasted 21 months, and the troupe returned to England in June 1912.{{sfn|Robinson|p=95}} Chaplin recalled that he "had a disquieting feeling of sinking back into a depressing commonplaceness" and was, therefore, delighted when a new tour began in October.{{sfnm|1a1=Chaplin|1pp=133134|2a1=Robinson|2p=96}}

Six months into the second American tour, Chaplin was invited to join the New York Motion Picture Company. A representative who had seen his performances thought he could replace Fred Mace, a star of their Keystone Studios who intended to leave.{{sfn|Robinson|p=102}} Chaplin thought the Keystone comedies "a crude mlange of rough and rumble", but liked the idea of working in films and rationalised: "Besides, it would mean a new life."{{sfn|Chaplin|pp=138139}} He met with the company and signed a $150-per-week (${{Inflation|US|150|1913|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars){{Inflation-fn|US}} contract in September 1913.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=103|2a1=Chaplin|2p=139}}

Chaplin arrived in Los Angeles, home of the Keystone studio, in early December 1913.{{sfn|Robinson|p=107}} His boss was Mack Sennett, who initially expressed concern that the 24-year-old looked too young.{{sfn|Chaplin|p=141}} He was not used in a picture until late January, during which time Chaplin attempted to learn the processes of filmmaking.{{sfn|Robinson|p=108}} The one-reeler ''Making a Living'' marked his film acting debut and was released on 2 February 1914. Chaplin strongly disliked the picture, but one review picked him out as "a comedian of the first water".{{sfn|Robinson|p=110}} For his second appearance in front of the camera, Chaplin selected the costume with which he became identified. He described the process in his autobiography:

{{quote|"I wanted everything to be a contradiction: the pants baggy, the coat tight, the hat small and the shoes large... I added a small moustache, which, I reasoned, would add age without hiding my expression. I had no idea of the character. But the moment I was dressed, the clothes and the makeup made me feel the person he was. I began to know him, and by the time I walked on stage he was fully born."{{sfn|Chaplin|p=145}}{{refn|Robinson notes that "this was not strictly true: the character was to take a year or more to evolve its full dimensions and even then  which was its particular strength  it would evolve during the whole rest of his career".{{sfn|Robinson|p=114}}|group=note}}}}

The film was ''Mabel's Strange Predicament'', but "the Tramp" character, as it became known, debuted to audiences in ''Kid Auto Races at Venice''  shot later than ''Mabel's Strange Predicament'' but released two days earlier.{{sfn|Robinson|p=113}} Chaplin adopted the character as his screen persona and attempted to make suggestions for the films he appeared in. These ideas were dismissed by his directors.{{sfn|Robinson|p=120}} During the filming of his eleventh picture, ''Mabel at the Wheel'', he clashed with director Mabel Normand and was almost released from his contract. Sennett kept him on, however, when he received orders from exhibitors for more Chaplin films. Sennett also allowed Chaplin to direct his next film himself after Chaplin promised to pay $1,500 (${{Inflation|US|1500|1913|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) if the film was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Robinson|p=121}}

''Caught in the Rain'', issued 4 May 1914, was Chaplin's directorial debut and was highly successful.{{sfn|Robinson|p=123}} Thereafter he directed almost every short film in which he appeared for Keystone,{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|p=5}} at the rate of approximately one per week,{{sfn|Kamin|p=xi}} a period which he later remembered as the most exciting time of his career.{{sfn|Chaplin|p=153}} Chaplin's films introduced a slower form of comedy than the typical Keystone farce,{{sfn|Robinson|p=113}} and he developed a large fan base.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=125|2a1=Maland|2y=(1989)|2pp=89}} In November 1914, he had a supporting role in the first feature length comedy film, ''Tillie's Punctured Romance'', directed by Sennett and starring Marie Dressler, which was a commercial success and increased his popularity.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=127128}} When Chaplin's contract came up for renewal at the end of the year, he asked for $1,000 a week (${{Inflation|US|1000|1913|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars)  an amount Sennett refused as too large.{{sfn|Robinson|p=131}}

====Essanay====

The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company of Chicago sent Chaplin an offer of $1,250 a week with a signing bonus of $10,000. He joined the studio in late December 1914,{{sfn|Robinson|p=135}} where he began forming a stock company of regular players, including Leo White, Bud Jamison, Paddy McGuire and Billy Armstrong. He soon recruited a leading lady  Edna Purviance, whom Chaplin met in a cafe and hired on account of her beauty. She went on to appear in 35 films with Chaplin over eight years;{{sfn|Robinson|pp=138139}} the pair also formed a romantic relationship that lasted into 1917.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=141, 219}}

Chaplin asserted a high level of control over his pictures and started to put more time and care into each film.{{sfnm|1a1=Neibaur|1p=23|2a1=Chaplin|2p=165|3a1=Robinson|3pp=140, 143}} There was a month-long interval between the release of his second production, ''A Night Out'', and his third, ''The Champion''.{{sfn|Robinson|p=143}} The final seven of Chaplin's 14 Essanay films were all produced at this slower pace.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|p=20}} Chaplin also began to alter his screen persona, which had attracted some criticism at Keystone for its "mean, crude, and brutish" nature.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|pp=6, 1418}} The character became more gentle and romantic;{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|pp=2124}} ''The Tramp'' (April 1915) was considered a particular turning point in his development.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=142|2a1=Neibaur|2pp=2324}} The use of pathos was developed further with ''The Bank'', in which Chaplin created a sad ending. Robinson notes that this was an innovation in comedy films, and marked the time when serious critics began to appreciate Chaplin's work.{{sfn|Robinson|p=146}} At Essanay, writes film scholar Simon Louvish, Chaplin "found the themes and the settings that would define the Tramp's world."{{sfn|Louvish|p=87}}

During 1915, Chaplin became a cultural phenomenon. Shops were stocked with Chaplin merchandise, he was featured in cartoons and comic strips, and several songs were written about him.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1pp=152153|2a1=Kamin|2p=xi|3a1=Maland|3y=(1989)|3p=10}} In July, a journalist for ''Motion Picture Magazine'' wrote that "Chaplinitis" had spread across America.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|p=8}} As his fame grew worldwide, he became the film industry's first international star.{{sfnm|1a1=Louvish|1p=74|2a1=Sklar|2p=72}} When the Essanay contract ended in December 1915,{{sfn|Robinson|p=149}}{{refn|After leaving Essanay, Chaplin found himself engaged in a legal battle with the company that lasted until 1922. It began when Essanay extended his last film for them, ''Burlesque on Carmen'', from a two-reeler to a feature film (by adding out-takes and new scenes with Leo White) without his consent. Chaplin applied for an injunction to prevent its distribution, but the case was dismissed in court. In a counter-claim, Essanay alleged that Chaplin had broken his contract by not producing the agreed number of films and sued him for $500,000 in damages. In addition, the company compiled another film, ''Triple Trouble'' (1918), from various unused Chaplin scenes and new material shot by White.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=149152}}|group=note}} Chaplin  fully aware of his popularity  requested a $150,000 signing bonus from his next studio. He received several offers, including Universal, Fox, and Vitagraph, the best of which came from the Mutual Film Corporation at $10,000 a week.{{sfn|Robinson|p=156}}

====Mutual====
thumb|left|upright|By 1916, Chaplin was a global phenomenon. Here he shows off some of his merchandise, c. 1918.

A contract was negotiated with Mutual that amounted to $670,000 a year (${{Inflation|US|0.67|1916|r=1|fmt=c}} million today), which Robinson says made Chaplin  at 26 years old  one of the highest paid people in the world.{{sfn|Robinson|p=160}} The high salary shocked the public and was widely reported in the press.{{sfn|Larcher|p=29}} John R. Freuler, the studio president, explained: "We can afford to pay Mr. Chaplin this large sum annually because the public wants Chaplin and will pay for him."{{sfn|Robinson|p=159}}

Mutual gave Chaplin his own Los Angeles studio to work in, which opened in March 1916.{{sfn|Robinson|p=164}} He added two key members to his stock company, Albert Austin and Eric Campbell,{{sfn|Robinson|pp=165166}} and produced a series of elaborate two-reelers: ''The Floorwalker'', ''The Fireman'', ''The Vagabond'', ''One A.M.'', and ''The Count''.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=169173}} For ''The Pawnshop'', he recruited the actor Henry Bergman, who was to work with Chaplin for 30 years.{{sfn|Robinson|p=175}} ''Behind the Screen'' and ''The Rink'' completed Chaplin's releases for 1916. The Mutual contract stipulated that he release a two-reel film every four weeks, which he had managed to achieve. With the new year, however, Chaplin began to demand more time.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=179180}} He made only four more films for Mutual over the first ten months of 1917: ''Easy Street'', ''The Cure'', ''The Immigrant'', and ''The Adventurer''.{{sfn|Robinson|p=191}} With their careful construction, these films are considered by Chaplin scholars to be among his finest work.{{sfnm|1a1=Brownlow|1p=45|2a1=Robinson|2p=191|3a1=Louvish|3p=104|4a1=Vance|4y=(2003)|4p=203}}  Later in life, Chaplin referred to his Mutual years as the happiest period of his career.{{sfn|Chaplin|p=188}} However, Chaplin also felt that those films became increasingly formulaic over the period of the contract and he was increasingly dissatisfied with the working conditions encouraging that.


Chaplin was attacked in the British media for not fighting in the First World War.{{sfn|Robinson|p=185}} He defended himself, revealing that he would fight for Britain if called and had registered for the American draft, but he was not summoned by either country.{{refn|The British embassy made a statement saying: "[Chaplin] is of as much use to Great Britain now making big money and subscribing to war loans as he would be in the trenches."{{sfn|Robinson|p=186}}|group=note}} Despite this criticism Chaplin was a favourite with the troops,{{sfn|Robinson|p=187}} and his popularity continued to grow worldwide.

Mutual were patient with Chaplin's decreased rate of output, and the contract ended amicably. With his aforementioned concern about the declining quality of his films because of contract scheduling stipulations, Chaplin's primary concern in finding a new distributor was independence; Sydney Chaplin, then his business manager, told the press, "Charlie [must] be allowed all the time he needs and all the money for producing [films] the way he wants... It is quality, not quantity, we are after."{{sfn|Robinson|p=221}} In June 1917, Chaplin signed to complete eight films for First National Exhibitors' Circuit in return for $1million (${{Inflation|US|1|1917|r=1|fmt=c}} million today).{{sfn|Schickel|p=8}} He chose to build his own studio, situated on five acres of land off Sunset Boulevard, with production facilities of the highest order.{{sfnm|1a1=Chaplin|1p=203|2a1=Robinson|2pp=225226}} It was completed in January 1918,{{sfn|Robinson|p=228}} and Chaplin was given freedom over the making of his pictures.

''A Dog's Life'', released April 1918, was the first film under the new contract. In it, Chaplin demonstrated his increasing concern with story construction and his treatment of the Tramp as "a sort of Pierrot".{{sfn|Chaplin|p=208}} The film was described by Louis Delluc as "cinema's first total work of art".{{sfn|Robinson|p=229}} Chaplin then embarked on the Third Liberty Bond campaign, touring the United States for one month to raise money for the Allies of the First World War.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=237, 241}} He also produced a short propaganda film, donated to the government for fund-raising, called ''The Bond''.{{sfn|Robinson|p=244}} Chaplin's next release was war-based, placing the Tramp in the trenches for ''Shoulder Arms''.

After the release of ''Shoulder Arms'', Chaplin requested more money from First National, which was refused.

Having fulfilled his First National contract, Chaplin was free to make his first picture as an independent producer.

While making ''The Gold Rush'', Chaplin married for the second time. Mirroring the circumstances of his first union, Lita Grey was a teenage actress, originally set to star in the film, whose surprise announcement of pregnancy forced Chaplin into marriage. She was 16 and he was 35, meaning Chaplin could have been charged with statutory rape under California law.{{sfn|Robinson|p=346}} He therefore arranged a discreet marriage in Mexico on 25 November 1924.{{sfnm|1a1=Chaplin and Vance|1p=53|2a1=Vance|2y=(2003)|2p=170}} Their first son, Charles Spencer Chaplin, Jr., was born on 5 May 1925, followed by Sydney Earl Chaplin on 30 March 1926.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=355, 368}}

Before the divorce suit was filed, Chaplin had begun work on a new film, ''The Circus''.{{sfn|Robinson|p=360}} He built a story around the idea of walking a tightrope while besieged by monkeys, and turned the Tramp into the accidental star of a circus.{{sfn|Robinson|p=361}} Filming was suspended for 10 months while he dealt with the divorce scandal,{{sfn|Robinson|pp=371, 381}} and it was generally a trouble-ridden production.{{sfn|Louvish|p=215}} Finally completed in October 1927, ''The Circus'' was released in January 1928 to a positive reception.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=382}} At the 1st Academy Awards, Chaplin was given a special trophy "For versatility and genius in acting, writing, directing and producing ''The Circus''".

''City Lights'' had been a success, but Chaplin was unsure if he could make another picture without dialogue. He remained convinced that sound would not work in his films, but was also "obsessed by a depressing fear of being old-fashioned."{{sfn|Chaplin|p=360}} In this state of uncertainty, early in 1931, the comedian decided to take a holiday and ended up travelling for 16 months.{{sfnm|1a1=Louvish|1p=243|2a1=Robinson|2p=420}}{{refn|Chaplin left the United States on 31 January 1931, and returned on 10 June 1932.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=664666}}|group=note}} He spent months travelling Western Europe, including extended stays in France and Switzerland, and spontaneously decided to visit Japan.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=429441}} The day after he arrived in Japan, Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated by ultra-nationalists in the May 15 Incident.

The 1940s saw Chaplin face a series of controversies, both in his work and in his personal life, which changed his fortunes and severely affected his popularity in the United States. The first of these was his growing boldness in expressing his political beliefs. Deeply disturbed by the surge of militaristic nationalism in 1930s world politics,{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=485|2a1=Maland|2y=(1989)|2p=159}} Chaplin found that he could not keep these issues out of his work.{{sfn|Chaplin|p=386}}  Parallels between himself and Adolf Hitler had been widely noted: the pair were born four days apart, both had risen from poverty to world prominence, and Hitler wore the same toothbrush moustache as Chaplin. It was this physical resemblance that supplied the plot for Chaplin's next film, ''The Great Dictator'', which directly satirised Hitler and attacked fascism.{{sfnm|1a1=Schickel|1p=28|2a1=Maland|2y=(1989)|2pp=165, 170|3a1=Louvish|3p=271|4a1=Robinson|4p=490|5a1=Larcher|5p=67|6a1=Kemp|6p=158}}

Chaplin spent two years developing the script,{{sfn|Chaplin|p=388}} and began filming in September 1939  six days after Britain declared war on Germany.{{sfn|Robinson|p=496}} He had submitted to using spoken dialogue, partly out of acceptance that he had no other choice, but also because he recognised it as a better method for delivering a political message.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|p=165}} Making a comedy about Hitler was seen as highly controversial, but Chaplin's financial independence allowed him to take the risk.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|p=164}} "I was determined to go ahead," he later wrote, "for Hitler must be laughed at."{{sfn|Chaplin|p=387}}{{refn|Chaplin later said that if he had known the extent of the Nazi Party's actions he would not have made the film; "Had I known the actual horrors of the German concentration camps, I could not have made ''The Great Dictator''; I could not have made fun of the homicidal insanity of the Nazis."{{sfn|Chaplin|p=388}}|group=note}} Chaplin replaced the Tramp (while wearing similar attire) with "A Jewish Barber", a reference to the Nazi party's belief that he was Jewish.{{refn|Speculation about Chaplin's racial origin existed from the earliest days of his fame, and it was often reported that he was a Jew. Research has uncovered no evidence of this, and when a reporter asked in 1915 if it was true, Chaplin responded, "I have not that good fortune." The Nazi Party believed that he was Jewish and banned ''The Gold Rush'' on this basis.

Most serious of these was an alleged violation of the Mann Act, which prohibits the transportation of women across state boundaries for sexual purposes.{{refn|According to the prosecutor, Chaplin had violated the act when he paid for Barry's trip to New York in October 1942, when he was also visiting the city. Both Chaplin and Barry agreed that they had met there briefly, and according to Barry, they had sexual intercourse.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|pp=204205}} Chaplin claimed that the last time he was intimate with Barry was May 1942.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=523524}}|group=note}} The historian Otto Friedrich has called this an "absurd prosecution" of an "ancient statute",{{sfn|Friedrich|pp=190, 393}} yet if Chaplin was found guilty, he faced 23 years in jail.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|p=215}} Three charges lacked sufficient evidence to proceed to court, but the Mann Act trial began in March 1944.

====''Monsieur Verdoux'' and communist accusations====
thumb|left|upright|''Monsieur Verdoux'' (1947), a dark comedy about a serial killer, marked a significant departure for Chaplin. He was so unpopular at the time of release that it flopped in the United States.

Chaplin claimed that the Barry trials had "crippled [his] creativeness", and it was some time before he began working again.{{sfn|Chaplin|p=426}} In April 1946, he finally began filming a project that had been in development since 1942.{{sfn|Robinson|p=520}} ''Monsieur Verdoux'' was a black comedy, the story of a French bank clerk, Verdoux (Chaplin), who loses his job and begins marrying and murdering wealthy widows to support his family. Chaplin's inspiration for the project came from Orson Welles, who wanted him to star in a film about the French serial killer Henri Dsir Landru. Chaplin decided that the concept would "make a wonderful comedy",{{sfn|Chaplin|p=412}} and paid Welles $5,000 for the idea.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=519520}}

Chaplin again vocalised his political views in ''Monsieur Verdoux'', criticising capitalism and arguing that the world encourages mass killing through wars and weapons of mass destruction.{{sfnm|1a1=Louvish|1p=304|2a1=Sbardellati and Shaw|2p=501}} Because of this, the film met with controversy when it was released in April 1947;{{sfnm|1a1=Louvish|1pp=296297|2a1=Robinson|2pp=538543|3a1=Larcher|3p=77}} Chaplin was booed at the premiere, and there were calls for a boycott.{{sfnm|1a1=Louvish|1pp=296297|2a1=Sbardellati and Shaw|2p=503}} ''Monsieur Verdoux'' was the first Chaplin release that failed both critically and commercially in the United States.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|pp=235245, 250}} It was more successful abroad,{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|p=250}} and Chaplin's screenplay was nominated at the Academy Awards.{{sfn|Louvish|p=297}} He was proud of the film, writing in his autobiography, "''Monsieur Verdoux'' is the cleverest and most brilliant film I have yet made."{{sfn|Chaplin|p=444}}

The negative reaction to ''Monsieur Verdoux'' was largely the result of changes in Chaplin's public image.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|p=251}} Along with damage of the Joan Barry scandal, he was publicly accused of being a communist.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1pp=538539|2a1=Friedrich|2p=287}} His political activity had heightened during World War II, when he campaigned for the opening of a Second Front to help the Soviet Union and supported various SovietAmerican friendship groups.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|p=253}} He was also friendly with several suspected communists, and attended functions given by Soviet diplomats in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|pp=221226, 253254}} In the political climate of 1940s America, such activities meant Chaplin was considered, as Larcher writes, "dangerously progressive and amoral."{{sfnm|1a1=Larcher|1p=75|2a1=Sbardellati and Shaw|2p=506|3a1=Louvish|3p=xiii}} The FBI wanted him out of the country,{{sfn|Sbardellati|p=152}} and launched an official investigation in early 1947.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|pp=265266}}{{refn|Chaplin had already attracted the attention of the FBI long before the 1940s, the first mention of him in their files being from 1922. J. Edgar Hoover first requested that a Security Index Card be filed for Chaplin in September 1946, but the Los Angeles office was slow to react and only began active investigation the next spring.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|pp=265266}} The FBI also requested and received help from MI5, particularly on investigating the false claims that Chaplin had not been born in England but in France or Eastern Europe, and that his real name was Israel Thornstein. The MI5 found no evidence of Chaplin being involved in the Communist Party.|group=note}}

Chaplin denied being a communist, instead calling himself a "peacemonger",{{sfnm|1a1=Louvish|1pp=xiv, 310|2a1=Chaplin|2p=458|3a1=Maland|3y=(1989)|3p=238}} but felt the government's effort to suppress the ideology was an unacceptable infringement of civil liberties.{{sfn|Robinson|p=544}} Unwilling to be quiet about the issue, he openly protested against the trials of Communist Party members and the activities of the House Un-American Activities Committee.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|pp=255256}} Chaplin received a subpoena to appear before HUAC but was not called to testify.{{sfnm|1a1=Friedrich|1p=286|2a1=Maland|2y=(1989)|2p=261}} As his activities were widely reported in the press, and Cold War fears grew, questions were raised over his failure to take American citizenship.{{sfnm|1a1=Larcher|1p=80|2a1=Sbardellati and Shaw|2p=510|3a1=Louvish|3p=xiii|4a1=Robinson|4p=545}} Calls were made for him to be deported; in one extreme and widely published example, Representative John E. Rankin, who helped establish HUAC, told Congress in June 1947: "[Chaplin's] very life in Hollywood is detrimental to the moral fabric of America. [If he is deported]... his loathsome pictures can be kept from before the eyes of the American youth. He should be deported and gotten rid of at once."{{sfn|Robinson|p=545}}

Although Chaplin remained politically active in the years following the failure of ''Monsieur Verdoux'',{{refn|In November 1947, Chaplin asked Pablo Picasso to hold a demonstration outside the US embassy in Paris to protest the deportation proceedings of Hanns Eisler, and in December, he took part in a petition asking for the deportation process to be dropped. In 1948, Chaplin supported the unsuccessful presidential campaign of Henry Wallace; and in 1949 he supported two peace conferences and signed a petition protesting the Peekskill incident.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|pp=256257}}|group=note}} his next film, about a forgotten vaudeville comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London, was devoid of political themes. ''Limelight'' was heavily autobiographical, alluding not only to Chaplin's childhood and the lives of his parents, but also to his loss of popularity in the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Maland|1y=(1989)|1pp=288290|2a1=Robinson|2pp=551552|3a1=Louvish|3p=312}} The cast included various members of his family, including his five oldest children and his half-brother, Wheeler Dryden.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|p=293}}

Filming began in November 1951, by which time Chaplin had spent three years working on the story.{{sfn|Louvish|p=317}}{{refn|''Limelight'' was conceived as a novel, which Chaplin wrote but never intended for publication.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=549570}}|group=note}} He aimed for a more serious tone than any of his previous films, regularly using the word "melancholy" when explaining his plans to his co-star Claire Bloom.{{sfn|Robinson|p=562}} ''Limelight'' featured a cameo appearance from Buster Keaton, whom Chaplin cast as his stage partner in a pantomime scene. This marked the only time the comedians worked together.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=567568}}

Chaplin decided to hold the world premiere of ''Limelight'' in London, since it was the setting of the film.{{sfn|Louvish|p=326}} As he left Los Angeles, he expressed a premonition that he would not be returning.{{sfn|Robinson|p=570}} At New York, he boarded the {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}} with his family on 18 September 1952.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|p=280}} The next day, attorney general James P. McGranery revoked Chaplin's re-entry permit and stated that he would have to submit to an interview concerning his political views and moral behaviour in order to re-enter the US.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|p=280}} Although McGranery told the press that he had "a pretty good case against Chaplin", Maland has concluded, on the basis of the FBI files that were released in the 1980s, that the US government had no real evidence to prevent Chaplin's re-entry. It is likely that he would have gained entry if he had applied for it.{{sfnm|1a1=Maland|1y=(1989)|1pp=280287|2a1=Sbardellati and Shaw|2pp=520521}} However, when Chaplin received a cablegram informing him of the news, he privately decided to cut his ties with the United States:

{{quote|Whether I re-entered that unhappy country or not was of little consequence to me. I would like to have told them that the sooner I was rid of that hate-beleaguered atmosphere the better, that I was fed up of America's insults and moral pomposity...{{sfn|Chaplin|p=455}}}}

Because all of his property remained in America, Chaplin refrained from saying anything negative about the incident to the press.{{sfn|Robinson|p=573}} The scandal attracted vast attention,{{sfn|Louvish|p=330}} but Chaplin and his film were warmly received in Europe.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|p=280}} In America, the hostility towards him continued, and, although it received some positive reviews, ''Limelight'' was subjected to a wide-scale boycott.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|pp=295298, 307311}} Reflecting on this, Maland writes that Chaplin's fall, from an "unprecedented" level of popularity, "may be the most dramatic in the history of stardom in America".{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|p=189}}

In the last two decades of his career, Chaplin concentrated on re-editing and scoring his old films for re-release, along with securing their ownership and distribution rights.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|p=326}} In an interview he granted in 1959, the year of his 70th birthday, Chaplin stated that there was still "room for the Little Man in the atomic age".{{sfn|Robinson|pp=594595}} The first of these re-releases was ''The Chaplin Revue'' (1959), which included new versions of ''A Dog's Life'', ''Shoulder Arms'', and ''The Pilgrim''.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=594595}}

In America, the political atmosphere began to change and attention was once again directed to Chaplin's films instead of his views.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|p=326}} In July 1962, ''The New York Times'' published an editorial stating that "we do not believe the Republic would be in danger if yesterday's unforgotten little tramp were allowed to amble down the gangplank of a steamer or plane in an American port".{{sfn|Lynn|pp=507508}} The same month, Chaplin was invested with the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters by the universities of Oxford and Durham.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=598599}} In November 1963, the Plaza Theater in New York started a year-long series of Chaplin's films, including ''Monsieur Verdoux'' and ''Limelight'', which gained excellent reviews from American critics.{{sfnm|1a1=Lynn|1p=509|2a1=Maland|2y=(1989)|2p=330}} September 1964 saw the release of Chaplin's memoirs, ''My Autobiography'', which he had been working on since 1957.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=602605}} The 500-page book, which focused on his early years and personal life, became a worldwide best-seller, despite criticism over the lack of information on his film career.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1pp=605607|2a1=Lynn|2pp=510512}}

Shortly after the publication of his memoirs, Chaplin began work on ''A Countess from Hong Kong'' (1967), a romantic comedy based on a script he had written for Paulette Goddard in the 1930s.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=608609}} Set on an ocean liner, it starred Marlon Brando as an American ambassador and Sophia Loren as a stowaway found in his cabin.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=608609}} The film differed from Chaplin's earlier productions in several aspects.

Until he began making spoken dialogue films with ''The Great Dictator'', Chaplin never shot from a completed script.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=173, 197, 310, 489}} Many of his early films began with only a vague premise  for example "Charlie enters a health spa" or "Charlie works in a pawn shop."{{sfn|Robinson|p=169}} He then had sets constructed and worked with his stock company to improvise gags and "business" using them, almost always working the ideas out on film.{{sfnm|1a1=Louvish|1p=103|2a1=Robinson|2p=168}} As ideas were accepted and discarded, a narrative structure would emerge, frequently requiring Chaplin to reshoot an already-completed scene that might have otherwise contradicted the story.{{sfnm|1a1=Louvish|1p=168|2a1=Robinson|2pp=166170, 489490|3a1=Brownlow|3p=187}}{{Clarify|reason=Is "pp. 489490" assigned to author Robinson or is this citation missing an author?|date=January 2017}} From ''A Woman of Paris'' onward Chaplin began the filming process with a prepared plot,{{sfn|Louvish|p=182}} but Robinson writes that every film up to ''Modern Times'' "went through many metamorphoses and permutations before the story took its final form."{{sfn|Robinson|p=460}}

Producing films in this manner meant Chaplin took longer to complete his pictures than almost any other filmmaker at the time.{{sfn|Louvish|p=228}} If he was out of ideas, he often took a break from the shoot, which could last for days, while keeping the studio ready for when inspiration returned.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1pp=234235|2a1=Cousins|2p=71}} Delaying the process further was Chaplin's rigorous perfectionism.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1pp=172, 177, 235, 311, 381, 399|2a1=Brownlow|2pp=59, 75, 82, 92, 147}} According to his friend Ivor Montagu, "nothing but perfection would be right" for the filmmaker.{{sfn|Brownlow|p=82}} Because he personally funded his films, Chaplin was at liberty to strive for this goal and shoot as many takes as he wished.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1pp=235, 311, 223|2a1=Brownlow|2p=82}} The number was often excessive, for instance 53 takes for every finished take in ''The Kid''.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=746|2a1=Maland|2y=(1989)|2p=359}} For ''The Immigrant'', a 20 minute-short, Chaplin shot 40,000 feet of film  enough for a feature-length.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=201|2a1=Brownlow|2p=192}}

Describing his working method as "sheer perseverance to the point of madness",{{sfn|Louvish|p=225}} Chaplin would be completely consumed by the production of a picture.{{sfnm|1a1=Brownlow|1p=157|2a1=Robinson|2pp=121, 469}} Robinson writes that even in Chaplin's later years, his work continued "to take precedence over everything and everyone else."{{sfn|Robinson|p=600}} The combination of story improvisation and relentless perfectionism  which resulted in days of effort and thousands of feet of film being wasted, all at enormous expense  often proved taxing for Chaplin who, in frustration, would lash out at his actors and crew.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1pp=371, 362, 469, 613|2a1=Brownlow|2pp=56, 136|3a1=Schickel|3p=8}}

Chaplin exercised complete control over his pictures,{{sfn|Robinson|p=606}} to the extent that he would act out the other roles for his cast, expecting them to imitate him exactly.{{sfnm|1a1=Bloom|1p=101|2a1=Brownlow|2pp=59, 98, 138, 154|3a1=Robinson|3p=614}}  He personally edited all of his films, trawling through the large amounts of footage to create the exact picture he wanted.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=140, 235, 236}} As a result of his complete independence, he was identified by the film historian Andrew Sarris as one of the first auteur filmmakers.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|p=353}} Chaplin did receive help, notably from his long-time cinematographer Roland Totheroh, brother Sydney Chaplin, and various assistant directors such as Harry Crocker and Charles Reisner.

===Style and themes===
thumb|upright=1.15|A collection of scenes from ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid'' (1921), demonstrating Chaplin's mixture of slapstick, pathos, and social commentary]]

While Chaplin's comedic style is broadly defined as slapstick,{{sfn|Robinson|p=212}} it is considered restrained and intelligent,{{sfn|Brownlow|p=30}} with the film historian Philip Kemp describing his work as a mix of "deft, balletic physical comedy and thoughtful, situation-based gags".{{sfn|Kemp|p=63}} Chaplin diverged from conventional slapstick by slowing the pace and exhausting each scene of its comic potential, with more focus on developing the viewer's relationship to the characters.{{sfn|Robinson|p=113}}{{sfn|Mast|pp=8392}} Unlike conventional slapstick comedies, Robinson states that the comic moments in Chaplin's films centre on the Tramp's attitude to the things happening to him: the humour does not come from the Tramp bumping into a tree, but from his lifting his hat to the tree in apology.{{sfn|Robinson|p=113}} Dan Kamin writes that Chaplin's "quirky mannerisms" and "serious demeanour in the midst of slapstick action" are other key aspects of his comedy,{{sfn|Kamin|pp=67}} while the surreal transformation of objects and the employment of in-camera trickery are also common features.{{sfnm|1a1=Mast|1pp=8392|2a1=Kamin|2pp=3334}}

Chaplin's silent films typically follow the Tramp's efforts to survive in a hostile world.{{sfn|Louvish|p=60}} The character lives in poverty and is frequently treated badly, but remains kind and upbeat;{{sfnm|1a1=Kemp|1p=63|2a1=Robinson|2pp=211, 352|3a1=Hansmeyer|3p=4}} defying his social position, he strives to be seen as a gentleman.{{sfn|Robinson|p=203}} As Chaplin said in 1925, "The whole point of the Little Fellow is that no matter how down on his ass he is, no matter how well the jackals succeed in tearing him apart, he's still a man of dignity."{{sfn|Weissman|(2009)|p=47}} The Tramp defies authority figures{{sfn|Dale|p=17}} and "gives as good as he gets",{{sfn|Weissman|(2009)|p=47}} leading Robinson and Louvish to see him as a representative for the underprivileged  an "everyman turned heroic saviour".{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1pp=455, 485|2a1=Louvish|2p=138|2ps= (for quote).}} Hansmeyer notes that several of Chaplin's films end with "the homeless and lonely Tramp [walking] optimistically... into the sunset... to continue his journey".{{sfn|Hansmeyer|p=4}}

The infusion of pathos is a well-known aspect of Chaplin's work,{{sfnm|1a1=Dale|1pp=9, 19, 20|2a1=Louvish|2p=203}} and Larcher notes his reputation for "[inducing] laughter and tears".{{sfn|Larcher|p=75}} Sentimentality in his films comes from a variety of sources, with Louvish pinpointing "personal failure, society's strictures, economic disaster, and the elements."{{sfn|Louvish|p=204}} Chaplin sometimes drew on tragic events when creating his films, as in the case of ''The Gold Rush'' (1925), which was inspired by the fate of the Donner Party.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=334335}} Constance B. Kuriyama has identified serious underlying themes in the early comedies, such as greed (''The Gold Rush'') and loss (''The Kid'').{{sfn|Kuriyama|p=31}} Chaplin also touched on controversial issues: immigration (''The Immigrant'', 1917); illegitimacy (''The Kid'', 1921); and drug use (''Easy Street'', 1917).{{sfn|Mast|pp=8392}} He often explored these topics ironically, making comedy out of suffering.{{sfn|Louvish|pp=137, 145}}

Social commentary was a feature of Chaplin's films from early in his career, as he portrayed the underdog in a sympathetic light and highlighted the difficulties of the poor.{{sfn|Robinson|p=599}} Later, as he developed a keen interest in economics and felt obliged to publicise his views,{{sfn|Robinson|p=456}} Chaplin began incorporating overtly political messages into his films.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|p=159}} ''Modern Times'' (1936) depicted factory workers in dismal conditions, ''The Great Dictator'' (1940) parodied Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and ended in a speech against nationalism, ''Monsieur Verdoux'' (1947) criticised war and capitalism, and ''A King in New York'' (1957) attacked McCarthyism.{{sfn|Larcher|pp=6289}}

Several of Chaplin's films incorporate autobiographical elements, and the psychologist Sigmund Freud believed that Chaplin "always plays only himself as he was in his dismal youth".{{sfn|Weissman|(1999)|pp=439445}} ''The Kid'' is thought to reflect Chaplin's childhood trauma of being sent into an orphanage,{{sfn|Weissman|(1999)|pp=439445}} the main characters in ''Limelight'' (1952) contain elements from the lives of his parents,{{sfn|Bloom|p=107}} and ''A King in New York'' references Chaplin's experiences of being shunned by the United States.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=588589}} Many of his sets, especially in street scenes, bear a strong similarity to Kennington, where he grew up. Stephen M. Weissman has argued that Chaplin's problematic relationship with his mentally ill mother was often reflected in his female characters and the Tramp's desire to save them.{{sfn|Weissman|(1999)|pp=439445}}

Regarding the structure of Chaplin's films, the scholar Gerald Mast sees them as consisting of sketches tied together by the same theme and setting, rather than having a tightly unified storyline.{{sfn|Mast|pp=123128}} Visually, his films are simple and economic,{{sfnm|1a1=Louvish|1p=298|2a1=Robinson|2p=592}} with scenes portrayed as if set on a stage.{{sfnm|1a1=Epstein|1pp=8485|2a1=Mast|2pp=8392|3a1=Louvish|3p=185}} His approach to filming was described by the art director Eugne Louri: "Chaplin did not think in 'artistic' images when he was shooting. He believed that action is the main thing. The camera is there to photograph the actors".{{sfn|Robinson|p=565}} In his autobiography, Chaplin wrote, "Simplicity is best... pompous effects slow up action, are boring and unpleasant... The camera should not intrude."{{sfn|Chaplin|p=250}}  This approach has prompted criticism, since the 1940s, for being "old fashioned",{{sfnm|1a1=Brownlow|1p=91|2a1=Louvish|2p=298|3a1=Kamin|3p=35}} while the film scholar Donald McCaffrey sees it as an indication that Chaplin never completely understood film as a medium.{{sfn|McCaffrey|pp=8295}} Kamin, however, comments that Chaplin's comedic talent would not be enough to remain funny on screen if he did not have an "ability to conceive and direct scenes specifically for the film medium".{{sfn|Kamin|p=29}}

===Composing===
thumb|upright|Chaplin playing the cello in 1915

Chaplin developed a passion for music as a child and taught himself to play the piano, violin, and cello.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=411|2a1=Louvish|2pp=1718}} He considered the musical accompaniment of a film to be important,{{sfn|Robinson|pp=382}} and from ''A Woman of Paris'' onwards he took an increasing interest in this area.{{sfn|Robinson|p=411}} With the advent of sound technology, Chaplin began using a synchronised orchestral soundtrack  composed by himself  for ''City Lights'' (1931). He thereafter composed the scores for all of his films, and from the late 1950s to his death, he scored all of his silent features and some of his short films.{{sfn|Vance|(2000)|p=xiii}}

As Chaplin was not a trained musician, he could not read sheet music and needed the help of professional composers, such as David Raksin, Raymond Rasch and Eric James, when creating his scores. Musical directors were employed to oversee the recording process, such as Alfred Newman for ''City Lights''.{{sfn|Slowik|p=133}} Although some critics have claimed that credit for his film music should be given to the composers who worked with him, Raksin  who worked with Chaplin on ''Modern Times''  stressed Chaplin's creative position and active participation in the composing process.{{sfn|Raksin and Berg|pp=4750}} This process, which could take months, would start with Chaplin describing to the composer(s) exactly what he wanted and singing or playing tunes he had improvised on the piano.{{sfn|Raksin and Berg|pp=4750}} These tunes were then developed further in a close collaboration among the composer(s) and Chaplin.{{sfn|Raksin and Berg|pp=4750}} According to film historian Jeffrey Vance, "although he relied upon associates to arrange varied and complex instrumentation, the musical imperative is his, and not a note in a Chaplin musical score was placed there without his assent."Vance, Jeffrey (4 August 2003). "Chaplin the Composer: An Excerpt from Chaplin: Genius of the Cinema". ''Variety'' Special Advertising Supplement, pp. 2021.

Chaplin's compositions produced three popular songs. "Smile", composed originally for ''Modern Times'' (1936) and later set to lyrics by John Turner and Geoffrey Parsons, was a hit for Nat King Cole in 1954. For ''Limelight'', Chaplin composed "Terry's Theme", which was popularised by Jimmy Young as "Eternally" (1952).{{sfn|Kamin|p=198}} Finally, "This Is My Song", performed by Petula Clark for ''A Countess from Hong Kong'' (1967), reached number one on the UK and other European charts.Hennessy, Mike (22 April 1967). "Chaplin's 'Song' Catches Fire in Europe". ''Billboard'', p. 60. Chaplin also received his only competitive Oscar for his composition work, as the ''Limelight'' theme won an Academy Award for Best Original Score in 1973 following the film's re-release.{{refn|Although the film had originally been released in 1952, it did not play for one week in Los Angeles because of its boycott, and thus did not meet the criterion for nomination until it was re-released in 1972.|group=note}}

==Legacy==
thumb|upright|left|Chaplin as the Tramp in 1915, cinema's "most universal icon"{{sfn|Sarris|p=139}}

In 1998, the film critic Andrew Sarris called Chaplin "arguably the single most important artist produced by the cinema, certainly its most extraordinary performer and probably still its most universal icon".{{sfn|Sarris|p=139}} He is described by the British Film Institute as "a towering figure in world culture", and was included in ''Time'' magazine's list of the "100 Most Important People of the 20th Century" for the "laughter [he brought] to millions" and because he "more or less invented global recognizability and helped turn an industry into an art".

The image of the Tramp has become a part of cultural history;{{sfn|Hansmeyer|p=3}} according to Simon Louvish, the character is recognisable to people who have never seen a Chaplin film, and in places where his films are never shown.{{sfn|Louvish|p=xvii}} The critic Leonard Maltin has written of the "unique" and "indelible" nature of the Tramp, and argued that no other comedian matched his "worldwide impact". Praising the character, Richard Schickel suggests that Chaplin's films with the Tramp contain the most "eloquent, richly comedic expressions of the human spirit" in movie history.{{sfn|Schickel|p=41}} Memorabilia connected to the character still fetches large sums in auctions: in 2006 a bowler hat and a bamboo cane that were part of the Tramp's costume were bought for $140,000 in a Los Angeles auction.

As a filmmaker, Chaplin is considered a pioneer and one of the most influential figures of the early twentieth century.{{sfnm|1a1=Cousins||1p=72|2a1=Kemp|2pp=8, 22|3a1=Gunning|3p=41|4a1=Sarris|4p=139|5a1=Hansmeyer|5p=3}} He is often credited as one of the medium's first artists.{{sfnm|1a1=Schickel|1pp=34|2a1=Cousins|2p=36|3a1=Robinson|3pp=209211|4a1=Kamin|4p=xiv}} Film historian Mark Cousins has written that Chaplin "changed not only the imagery of cinema, but also its sociology and grammar" and claims that Chaplin was as important to the development of comedy as a genre as D.W. Griffith was to drama.{{sfn|Cousins|p=70}} He was the first to popularise feature-length comedy and to slow down the pace of action, adding pathos and subtlety to it.{{sfn|Schickel|pp=7, 13}} Although his work is mostly classified as slapstick, Chaplin's drama ''A Woman of Paris'' (1923) was a major influence on Ernst Lubitsch's film ''The Marriage Circle'' (1924) and thus played a part in the development of "sophisticated comedy".{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1pp=398399|2a1=Robinson|2p=321|3a1=Louvish|3p=185}} According to David Robinson, Chaplin's innovations were "rapidly assimilated to become part of the common practice of film craft."{{sfn|Robinson|p=321}} Filmmakers who cited Chaplin as an influence include Federico Fellini (who called Chaplin "a sort of Adam, from whom we are all descended"),{{sfn|Robinson|p=632}} Jacques Tati ("Without him I would never have made a film"),{{sfn|Robinson|p=632}} Ren Clair ("He inspired practically every filmmaker"),{{sfn|Robinson|p=631}} Michael Powell,{{sfn|Brownlow|p=77}} Billy Wilder, Vittorio De Sica,{{sfn|Cardullo|pp=16, 212}} and Richard Attenborough. Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky praised Chaplin as "the only person to have gone down into cinematic history without any shadow of a doubt. The films he left behind can never grow old."

Chaplin also strongly influenced the work of later comedians. Marcel Marceau said he was inspired to become a mime artist after watching Chaplin, while the actor Raj Kapoor based his screen persona on the Tramp. Mark Cousins has also detected Chaplin's comedic style in the French character Monsieur Hulot and the Italian character Tot. In other fields, Chaplin helped inspire the cartoon characters Felix the Cat{{sfn|Canemaker|pp=38, 78}} and Mickey Mouse,{{sfn|Jackson|pp=439444}} and was an influence on the Dada art movement.{{sfn|Simmons|pp=811}} As one of the founding members of United Artists, Chaplin also had a role in the development of the film industry. Gerald Mast has written that although UA never became a major company like MGM or Paramount Pictures, the idea that directors could produce their own films was "years ahead of its time".{{sfn|Mast|p=100}}

In the 21st century, several of Chaplin's films are still regarded as classics and among the greatest ever made. The 2012 ''Sight & Sound'' poll, which compiles "top ten" ballots from film critics and directors to determine each group's most acclaimed films,
saw ''City Lights'' rank among the critics' top 50, ''Modern Times'' inside the top 100, and ''The Great Dictator'' and ''The Gold Rush'' placed in the top 250. The top 100 films as voted on by directors included ''Modern Times'' at number 22, ''City Lights'' at number 30, and ''The Gold Rush'' at number 91. Every one of Chaplin's features received a vote. In 2007, the American Film Institute named ''City Lights'' the 11th greatest American film of all time, while ''The Gold Rush'' and ''Modern Times'' again ranked in the top 100. Books about Chaplin continue to be published regularly, and he is a popular subject for media scholars and film archivists.{{sfnm|1a1=Louvish|1p=xvi|2a1=Maland|2pp=xi, 359, 370}}{{Clarify|reason=Is "Maland" for the 1989 or 2007 publication source?|date=January 2017}} Many of Chaplin's film have had a DVD and Blu-Ray release.


===Commemoration and tributes===

Chaplin's final home, Manoir de Ban in Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland, has been converted into a museum named "Chaplin's World". It opened on 17 April 2016 after 15 years of development, and is described by Reuters as "an interactive museum showcasing the life and works of Charlie Chaplin". On the 128th anniversary of his birth, a record-setting 662 people dressed as the Tramp in an event organised by the museum. Previously, the Museum of the Moving Image in London held a permanent display on Chaplin, and hosted a dedicated exhibition to his life and career in 1988. The London Film Museum hosted an exhibition called ''Charlie Chaplin  The Great Londoner'', from 2010 until 2013.

In London, a statue of Chaplin as the Tramp, sculpted by John Doubleday and unveiled in 1981, is located in Leicester Square.{{sfn|Robinson|p=677}} The city also includes a road named after him in central London, "Charlie Chaplin Walk", which is the location of the BFI IMAX. There are nine blue plaques memorialising Chaplin in London, Hampshire, and Yorkshire. The Swiss town of Vevey named a park in his honour in 1980 and erected a statue there in 1982.{{sfn|Robinson|p=677}} In 2011, two large murals depicting Chaplin on two 14-storey buildings were also unveiled in Vevey. (In French) Chaplin has also been honoured by the Irish town of Waterville, where he spent several summers with his family in the 1960s. A statue was erected in 1998; since 2011, the town has been host to the annual Charlie Chaplin Comedy Film Festival, which was founded to celebrate Chaplin's legacy and to showcase new comic talent.

In other tributes, a minor planet, 3623 Chaplin  discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Karachkina in 1981  is named after Chaplin.{{sfn|Schmadel|p=305}} Throughout the 1980s, the Tramp image was used by IBM to advertise their personal computers.{{sfn|Maland|(1989)|pp=362370}} Chaplin's 100th birthday anniversary in 1989 was marked with several events around the world,{{refn|On his birthday, 16 April, ''City Lights'' was screened at a gala at the Dominion Theatre in London, the site of its British premiere in 1931.

===Characterisations===
Chaplin is the subject of a biographical film, ''Chaplin'' (1992) directed by Richard Attenborough, and starring Robert Downey Jr. in the title role. He is also a character in the period drama film ''The Cat's Meow'' (2001), played by Eddie Izzard, and in the made-for-television movie ''The Scarlett O'Hara War'' (1980), played by Clive Revill. A television series about Chaplin's childhood, ''Young Charlie Chaplin'', ran on PBS in 1989, and was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program.

Chaplin's life has also been the subject of several stage productions. Two musicals, ''Little Tramp'' and ''Chaplin'', were produced in the early 1990s. In 2006, Thomas Meehan and Christopher Curtis created another musical, ''Limelight: The Story of Charlie Chaplin'', which was first performed at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego in 2010. It was adapted for Broadway two years later, re-titled ''Chaplin  A Musical''. Chaplin was portrayed by Robert McClure in both productions. In 2013, two plays about Chaplin premiered in Finland: ''Chaplin'' at the Svenska Teatern, and ''Kulkuri'' (''The Tramp'') at the Tampere Workers' Theatre.

Chaplin has also been characterised in literary fiction. He is the protagonist of Robert Coover's short story "Charlie in the House of Rue" (1980; reprinted in Coover's 1987 collection ''A Night at the Movies''), and of Glen David Gold's ''Sunnyside'' (2009), a historical novel set in the First World War period. A day in Chaplin's life in 1909 is dramatised in the chapter entitled "Modern Times" in Alan Moore's ''Jerusalem'' (2016), a novel set in the author's home town of Northampton, England.

==Awards and recognition==

Chaplin received many awards and honours, especially later in life. In the 1975 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE). He was also awarded honorary Doctor of Letters degrees by the University of Oxford and the University of Durham in 1962.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=598599}} In 1965, he and Ingmar Bergman were joint winners of the Erasmus Prize{{sfn|Robinson|p=610}} and, in 1971, he was appointed a Commander of the National Order of the Legion of Honour by the French government.

From the film industry, Chaplin received a special Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1972,{{sfn|Robinson|pp=625626}} and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Lincoln Center Film Society the same year. The latter has since been presented annually to filmmakers as The Chaplin Award. Chaplin was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1972, having been previously excluded because of his political beliefs.{{sfn|Williams|p=311}}

Chaplin received three Academy Awards: an Honorary Award for "versatility and genius in acting, writing, directing, and producing ''The Circus''" in 1929, a second Honorary Award for "the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century" in 1972,{{sfn|Robinson|pp=623625}} and a Best Score award in 1973 for ''Limelight'' (shared with Ray Rasch and Larry Russell). He was further nominated in the Best Actor, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Picture (as producer) categories for ''The Great Dictator'', and received another Best Original Screenplay nomination for ''Monsieur Verdoux''. In 1976, Chaplin was made a Fellow of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA).
