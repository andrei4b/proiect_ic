'''Kanye Omari West''' ({{IPAc-en||k||n|j|e}}; born June 8, 1977) is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, entrepreneur and fashion designer. He is one of the most popular rappers in the world, and one of the world's best-selling music artists. West's contributions to music and fashion, along with his publicized personal life made him a global figure in popular culture.

Born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago, West first became known as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s, producing and co-producing hit singles for artists such as Jay-Z and Talib Kweli. Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, West released his debut album ''The College Dropout'' in 2004 to widespread critical and commercial success, and founded the record label GOOD Music. He went on to pursue a variety of styles on subsequent albums ''Late Registration'' (2005), ''Graduation'' (2007), and the polarizing ''808s & Heartbreak'' (2008). In 2010, he released his fifth album ''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'' to rave reviews from critics, and followed with the collaborative album ''Watch the Throne'' (2011) with Jay-Z. West released his abrasive sixth album ''Yeezus'' to further critical praise in 2013, and his seventh album ''The Life of Pablo'' in 2016, noted for its fragmented musical style. West's eighth studio album, ''ye'', was released in 2018. 

West's outspoken views and life outside of music have received significant mainstream attention. He has been a frequent source of controversy for his conduct at award shows, on social media, and in other public settings, as well as his comments on the music and fashion industries, U.S. politics, and race. As a fashion designer, he has collaborated with Nike, Louis Vuitton, and A.P.C. on both clothing and footwear, and have most prominently resulted in the YEEZY collaboration with Adidas beginning in 2013. He is the founder and head of the creative content company DONDA.

West is among the most acclaimed musicians of the 21st century. He has sold more than 100 million digital downloads and 21 million albums worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He has won a total of 21 Grammy Awards, making him one of the most awarded artists of all time and the most Grammy-awarded artist of his generation. Three of his albums have been included and ranked on ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s 2012 update of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time" list. ''Time'' magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2005 and 2015.

==Early life==
Kanye Omari West was born on June 8, 1977, in Atlanta, Georgia. After his parents divorced when he was three years old he moved with his mother to Chicago, Illinois. His father, Ray West, is a former Black Panther and was one of the first black photojournalists at ''The Atlanta Journal-Constitution''. Ray West was later a Christian counselor, and in 2006, opened the Good Water Store and Caf in Lexington Park, Maryland with startup capital from his son. West's mother, Dr. Donda C. (Williams) West, was a professor of English at Clark Atlanta University, and the Chair of the English Department at Chicago State University before retiring to serve as his manager. West was raised in a middle-class background, attending Polaris High School in suburban Oak Lawn, Illinois, after living in Chicago. At the age of 10, West moved with his mother to Nanjing, China, where she was teaching at Nanjing University as part of an exchange program. According to his mother, West was the only foreigner in his class, but settled in well and quickly picked up the language, although he has since forgotten most of it. When asked about his grades in high school, West replied, "I got A's and B's. And I'm not even frontin'."

West demonstrated an affinity for the arts at an early age; he began writing poetry when he was five years old. His mother recalled that she first took notice of West's passion for drawing and music when he was in the third grade.West, Donda, p. 105 West started rapping in the third grade and began making musical compositions in the seventh grade, eventually selling them to other artists. At age thirteen, West wrote a rap song called "Green Eggs and Ham" and began to persuade his mother to pay $25 an hour for time in a recording studio. It was a small, crude basement studio where a microphone hung from the ceiling by a wire clothes hanger. Although this wasn't what West's mother wanted, she nonetheless supported him. West crossed paths with producer/DJ No I.D., with whom he quickly formed a close friendship. No I.D. soon became West's mentor, and it was from him that West learned how to sample and program beats after he received his first sampler at age 15.{{Rp|557}} After graduating from high school, West received a scholarship to attend Chicago's American Academy of Art in 1997 and began taking painting classes, but shortly after transferred to Chicago State University to study English. He soon realized that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his musical work, and at 20 he dropped out of college to pursue his musical dreams.West, Donda, p. 106 This action greatly displeased his mother, who was also a professor at the university. She later commented, "It was drummed into my head that college is the ticket to a good life... but some career goals don't require college. For Kanye to make an album called ''College Dropout'' it was more about having the guts to embrace who you are, rather than following the path society has carved out for you."{{Rp|558}}

In 2015, West was awarded an honorary doctorate from the School of the Art Institute in Chicago.

==Career==

===19962002: Early work and Roc-A-Fella Records===
Kanye West began his early production career in the mid-1990s, making beats primarily for burgeoning local artists, eventually developing a style that involved speeding up vocal samples from classic soul records. His first official production credits came at the age of nineteen when he produced eight tracks on ''Down to Earth'', the 1996 debut album of a Chicago rapper named Grav. For a time, West acted as a ghost producer for Deric "D-Dot" Angelettie. Because of his association with D-Dot, West wasn't able to release a solo album, so he formed and became a member and producer of the Go-Getters, a late-1990s Chicago rap group composed of him, GLC, Timmy G, Really Doe, and Arrowstar. His group was managed by John "Monopoly" Johnson, Don Crowley, and Happy Lewis under the management firm Hustle Period. After attending a series of promotional photo shoots and making some radio appearances, The Go-Getters released their first and only studio album ''World Record Holders'' in 1999. The album featured other Chicago-based rappers such as Rhymefest, Mikkey Halsted, Miss Criss, and Shayla G. Meanwhile, the production was handled by West, Arrowstar, Boogz, and Brian "All Day" Miller.

West spent much of the late 1990s producing records for a number of well-known artists and music groups. The third song on Foxy Brown's second studio album ''Chyna Doll'' was produced by West. Her second effort subsequently became the very first hip-hop album by a female rapper to debut at the top of the U.S. ''Billboard'' 200 chart in its first week of release. West produced three of the tracks on Harlem World's first and only album ''The Movement'' alongside Jermaine Dupri and the production duo Trackmasters. His songs featured rappers Nas, Drag-On, and R&B singer Carl Thomas. The ninth track from ''World Party'', the last Goodie Mob album to feature the rap group's four founding members prior to their break-up, was co-produced by West with his manager Deric "D-Dot" Angelettie. At the close of the millennium, West ended up producing six songs for ''Tell 'Em Why U Madd'', an album that was released by D-Dot under the alias of The Madd Rapper; a fictional character he created for a skit on The Notorious B.I.G.'s second and final studio album ''Life After Death''. West's songs featured guest appearances from rappers such as Ma$e, Raekwon, and Eminem.
thumb|right|upright=1.15|West received early acclaim for his production work on Jay-Z's ''The Blueprint''; the two are pictured here in 2011.
West got his big break in the year 2000, when he began to produce for artists on Roc-A-Fella Records. West came to achieve recognition and is often credited with revitalizing Jay-Z's career with his contributions to the rap mogul's influential 2001 album ''The Blueprint''. ''The Blueprint'' is consistently ranked among the greatest hip-hop albums, and the critical and financial success of the album generated substantial interest in West as a producer. Serving as an in-house producer for Roc-A-Fella Records, West produced records for other artists from the label, including Beanie Sigel, Freeway, and Cam'ron. He also crafted hit songs for Ludacris, Alicia Keys, and Janet Jackson.Mitchum, Rob. [http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8767-the-college-dropout/ Review: ''The College Dropout'']. ''Pitchfork''.

Despite his success as a producer, West's true aspiration was to be a rapper. Though he had developed his rapping long before he began producing, it was often a challenge for West to be accepted as a rapper, and he struggled to attain a record deal. Multiple record companies ignored him because he did not portray the 'gangsta image' prominent in mainstream hip hop at the time.{{Rp|556}} After a series of meetings with Capitol Records, West was ultimately denied an artist deal.

According to Capitol Record's A&R, Joe Weinberger, he was approached by West and almost signed a deal with him, but another person in the company convinced Capitol's president not to. Desperate to keep West from defecting to another label, then-label head Damon Dash reluctantly signed West to Roc-A-Fella Records. Jay-Z later admitted that Roc-A-Fella was initially reluctant to support West as a rapper, claiming that many saw him as a producer first and foremost, and that his background contrasted with that of his labelmates.{{Rp|556}}

West's breakthrough came a year later on October 23, 2002, when, while driving home from a California recording studio after working late, he fell asleep at the wheel causing a head on crash with another car. The crash left him with a shattered jaw, which had to be wired shut in reconstructive surgery. The crash broke both legs of the other driver. The accident inspired West; two weeks after being admitted to the hospital, he recorded a song at the Record Plant Studios with his jaw still wired shut.Kearney, Kevin (September 30, 2005).

The composition, "Through The Wire", expressed West's experience after the accident, and helped lay the foundation for his debut album, as according to West "all the better artists have expressed what they were going through".|title=Kanye West  Biography|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|publisher=Allmusic.

Don't let society tell you, 'This is what you have to do.'"Reid, Shaheem (December 10, 2002).

West recorded the remainder of the album in Los Angeles while recovering from the car accident. Once he had completed the album, it was leaked months before its release date. However, West decided to use the opportunity to review the album, and ''The College Dropout'' was significantly remixed, remastered, and revised before being released. As a result, certain tracks originally destined for the album were subsequently retracted, among them "Keep the Receipt" with Ol' Dirty Bastard and "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" with Consequence. West meticulously refined the production, adding string arrangements, gospel choirs, improved drum programming and new verses. West's perfectionism led ''The College Dropout'' to have its release postponed three times from its initial date in August 2003.

''The College Dropout'' was eventually issued by Roc-A-Fella in February 2004, shooting to number two on the ''Billboard'' 200 as his debut single, "Through the Wire" peaked at number fifteen on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart for five weeks.[http://acharts.us/song/337 Kanye West  Through the Wire  Music Charts]. aCharts.us. Retrieved July 3, 2010. "Slow Jamz", his second single featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx, became an even bigger success: it became the three musicians' first number one hit. ''The College Dropout'' received near-universal critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, was voted the top album of the year by two major music publications, and has consistently been ranked among the great hip-hop works and debut albums by artists. "Jesus Walks", the album's fourth single, perhaps exposed West to a wider audience; the song's subject matter concerns faith and Christianity. The song nevertheless reached the top 20 of the ''Billboard'' pop charts, despite industry executives' predictions that a song containing such blatant declarations of faith would never make it to radio. ''The College Dropout'' would eventually be certified triple platinum in the US, and garnered West 10 Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year, and Best Rap Album (which it received). During this period, West also founded GOOD Music, a record label and management company that would go on to house affiliate artists and producers, such as No I.D. and John Legend. At the time, the focal point of West's production style was the use of sped-up vocal samples from soul records.Sheffield, Rob (November 22, 2010). [https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy-20101109 Review: ''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'']. ''Rolling Stone''. Retrieved November 11, 2010. However, partly because of the acclaim of ''The College Dropout'', such sampling had been much copied by others; with that overuse, and also because West felt he had become too dependent on the technique, he decided to find a new sound.Brown, p. 121 During this time, he also produced singles for Brandy, Common, John Legend, and Slum Village.

Beginning his second effort that fall, West would invest two million dollars and take over a year to craft his second album.Brown, p. 120 West was significantly inspired by ''Roseland NYC Live'', a 1998 live album by English trip hop group Portishead, produced with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Early in his career, the live album had inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hip-hop production. Though West had not been able to afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album, the money from his commercial success enabled him to hire a string orchestra for his second album ''Late Registration''. West collaborated with American film score composer Jon Brion, who served as the album's co-executive producer for several tracks.Perez, Rodrigo (August 12, 2005). [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1507538/20050812/west_kanye.jhtml "Kanye's Co-Pilot, Jon Brion, Talks About The Making Of Late Registration"]. MTV. Viacom. Retrieved March 2, 2006. Although Brion had no prior experience in creating hip-hop records, he and West found that they could productively work together after their first afternoon in the studio where they discovered that neither confined his musical knowledge and vision to one specific genre.Brown, p. 124 ''Late Registration'' sold over 2.3million units in the United States alone by the end of 2005 and was considered by industry observers as the only successful major album release of the fall season, which had been plagued by steadily declining CD sales.

While West had encountered controversy a year prior when he stormed out of the American Music Awards of 2004 after losing Best New Artist, his first large-scale controversy came just days following ''Late Registration''{{'s}} release, during a benefit concert for Hurricane Katrina victims. In September 2005, NBC broadcast A Concert for Hurricane Relief, and West was a featured speaker. When West was presenting alongside actor Mike Myers, he deviated from the prepared script. Myers spoke next and continued to read the script. Once it was West's turn to speak again, he said, "George Bush doesn't care about black people."{{efn|I hate the way they portray us in the media. You see a black family, it says, 'They're looting.' You see a white family, it says, 'They're looking for food.' And, you know, it's been five days [waiting for federal help] because most of the people are black. And even for me to complain about it, I would be a hypocrite because I've tried to turn away from the TV because it's too hard to watch. I've even been shopping before even giving a donation, so now I'm calling my business manager right now to see what is the biggest amount I can give, and just to imagine if I was down there, and those are my people down there. So anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can helpwith the way America is set up to help the poor, the black people, the less well-off, as slow as possible. I mean, the Red Cross is doing everything they can. We already realize a lot of people that could help are at war right now, fighting another wayand they've given them permission to go down and shoot us!}} West's comment reached much of the United States, leading to mixed reactions; President Bush would later call it one of the most "disgusting moments" of his presidency.Itzkoff, Dave, [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/kanye-west-criticizes-today-show-for-brutal-interview/ "UPDATED: Kanye West Criticizes 'Today' Show for 'Brutal' Interview"], ''The New York Times'' Arts Beat blog, November 10, 2010, 2:25pm.

===200709: ''Graduation'', ''808s & Heartbreak'', and VMAs controversy===
{{main|Graduation (album)|808s & Heartbreak}}
Fresh off spending the previous year touring the world with U2 on their Vertigo Tour, West felt inspired to compose anthemic rap songs that could operate more efficiently in large arenas. To this end, West incorporated the synthesizer into his hip-hop production, utilized slower tempos, and experimented with electronic music and influenced by music of the 1980s. In addition to U2, West drew musical inspiration from arena rock bands such as The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin in terms of melody and chord progression. To make his next effort, the third in a planned tetralogy of education-themed studio albums, more introspective and personal in lyricism, West listened to folk and country singer-songwriters Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash in hopes of developing methods to augment his wordplay and storytelling ability.

West's third studio album, ''Graduation'', garnered major publicity when its release date pitted West in a sales competition against rapper 50 Cent's ''Curtis''.Reid, Shaheem. [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1569778/20070914/50_cent.jhtml 50 Cent Or Kanye West, Who Will Win? Nas, Timbaland, More Share Their Predictions]. MTV. Viacom. Retrieved December 24, 2009. Upon their September 2007 releases, ''Graduation'' outsold ''Curtis'' by a large margin, debuting at number one on the U.S. ''Billboard'' 200 chart and selling 957,000 copies in its first week. ''Graduation'' continued the string of critical and commercial successes by West, and the album's lead single, "Stronger", garnered his third number-one hit. "Stronger", which samples French house duo Daft Punk, has been accredited to not only encouraging other hip-hop artists to incorporate house and electronica elements into their music, but also for playing a part in the revival of disco and electro-infused music in the late 2000s. Ben Detrick of ''XXL'' cited the outcome of the sales competition between 50 Cent's ''Curtis'' and West's ''Graduation'' as being responsible for altering the direction of hip-hop and paving the way for new rappers who didn't follow the hardcore-gangster mold, writing, "If there was ever a watershed moment to indicate hip-hop's changing direction, it may have come when 50 Cent competed with Kanye in 2007 to see whose album would claim superior sales."

West's life took a different direction when his mother, Donda West, died of complications from cosmetic surgery involving abdominoplasty and breast reduction in November 2007. Months later, West and fiance Alexis Phifer ended their engagement and their long-term intermittent relationship, which had begun in 2002. The events profoundly affected West, who set off for his 2008 Glow in the Dark Tour shortly thereafter. Purportedly because his emotions could not be conveyed through rapping, West decided to sing using the voice audio processor Auto-Tune, which would become a central part of his next effort. West had previously experimented with the technology on his debut album ''The College Dropout'' for the background vocals of "Jesus Walks" and "Never Let Me Down." Recorded mostly in Honolulu, Hawaii in three weeks, West announced his fourth album, ''808s & Heartbreak'', at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, where he performed its lead single, "Love Lockdown". Music audiences were taken aback by the uncharacteristic production style and the presence of Auto-Tune, which typified the pre-release response to the record.

''808s & Heartbreak'', which features extensive use of the eponymous Roland TR-808 drum machine and contains themes of love, loneliness, and heartache, was released by Island Def Jam to capitalize on Thanksgiving weekend in November 2008. Reviews were positive, though slightly more mixed than his previous efforts. Despite this, the record's singles demonstrated outstanding chart performances. Upon its release, the lead single "Love Lockdown" debuted at number three on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and became a "Hot Shot Debut", while follow-up single "Heartless" performed similarly and became his second consecutive "Hot Shot Debut" by debuting at number four on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/searchResult.jsp?exp=y&Ne=4&inert=25&Ntt=Heartless+Kanye+West&Ntk=Keyword&Ntx=mode+matchallpartial&nor=10&an=bbcom&Ns=FORMATTED_DATE|0&N=37+4294126188#pos25 Heartless: Hot 100 Charts].

While it was criticized prior to release, ''808s & Heartbreak'' had a significant effect on hip-hop music, encouraging other rappers to take more creative risks with their productions.

West's controversial incident the following year at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards was arguably his biggest controversy, and led to widespread outrage throughout the music industry. During the ceremony, West crashed the stage and grabbed the microphone from winner Taylor Swift in order to proclaim that, instead, Beyonc's video for "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", nominated for the same award, was "one of the best videos of all time". He was subsequently withdrawn from the remainder of the show for his actions. West's Fame Kills tour with Lady Gaga was cancelled in response to the controversy.

''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'', West's fifth studio album, was released in November 2010 to widespread acclaim from critics, many of whom considered it his best work and said it solidified his comeback. In stark contrast to his previous effort, which featured a minimalist sound, ''Dark Fantasy'' adopts a maximalist philosophy and deals with themes of celebrity and excess. The record included the international hit "All of the Lights", and ''Billboard'' hits "Power", "Monster", and "Runaway",[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=kanye west|chart=all}} Kanye West Album & Song Chart History  Hot 100].

This promotion ran from August 20  December 17, 2010. ''Dark Fantasy'' went on to go platinum in the United States, but its omission as a contender for Album of the Year at the 54th Grammy Awards was viewed as a "snub" by several media outlets.

2011 saw West embark on a festival tour to commemorate the release of ''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'' performing and headlining numerous festivals including; SWU Music & Arts, Austin City Limits, Oya Festival, Flow Festival, Live Music Festival,
The Big Chill, Essence Music Festival, Lollapalooza and Coachella which was described by ''The Hollywood Reporter'' as "one of greatest hip-hop sets of all time", West released the collaborative album ''Watch the Throne'' with Jay-Z in August 2011. By employing a sales strategy that released the album digitally weeks before its physical counterpart, ''Watch the Throne'' became one of the few major label albums in the Internet age to avoid a leak. "Niggas in Paris" became the record's highest charting single, peaking at number five on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. The co-headlining Watch the Throne Tour kicked off in October 2011 and concluded in June 2012. In 2012, West released the compilation album ''Cruel Summer'', a collection of tracks by artists from West's record label GOOD Music.

{{main|Yeezus|The Yeezus Tour|Adidas Yeezy}}
Sessions for West's sixth solo effort begin to take shape in early 2013 in his own personal loft's living room at a Paris hotel. Determined to "undermine the commercial", he once again brought together close collaborators and attempted to incorporate Chicago drill, dancehall, acid house, and industrial music. Primarily inspired by architecture, West's perfectionist tendencies led him to contact producer Rick Rubin fifteen days shy of its due date to strip down the record's sound in favor of a more minimalist approach. Initial promotion of his sixth album included worldwide video projections of the album's music and live television performances.
''Yeezus'', West's sixth album, was released June 18, 2013 to rave reviews from critics. It became his sixth consecutive number one debut, but also marked his lowest solo opening week sales. Def Jam issued "Black Skinhead" to radio in July 2013 as the album's lead single.

In September 2013, Kanye West announced he would be headlining his first solo tour in five years, to support ''Yeezus'', with fellow American rapper Kendrick Lamar accompanying him as supporting act. The tour was met with rave reviews from critics. ''Rolling Stone'' described it as "crazily entertaining, hugely ambitious, emotionally affecting (really!) and, most importantly, totally bonkers." Writing for ''Forbes'', Zack O'Malley Greenburg praised West for "taking risks that few pop stars, if any, are willing to take in today's hyper-exposed world of pop," describing the show as "overwrought and uncomfortable at times, but [it] excels at challenging norms and provoking thought in a way that just isn't common for mainstream musical acts of late."

==Musical style==
West's musical career has been defined by frequent stylistic shifts and different musical approaches. Asked about his early musical inspirations in 2008, he named artists such as A Tribe Called Quest, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, George Michael, LL Cool J, Phil Collins and Madonna.[http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/kanye-west-interviewed "Kanye West Interviewed.] ''Clash Music''.

West was formatively mentored by Chicago producer No I.D., who introduced him to hip hop production in the early 1990s, allowing a teenage West to sit in on recording sessions. Early in his career, West pioneered a style of production dubbed "chipmunk soul"Bailey, Julius. ''The Cultural Impact of Kanye West''. which utilized pitched-up vocal samples, usually from soul and R&B songs, along with his own drums and instrumentation. His first major release featuring his trademark vocal sampling style was "This Can't Be Life", a track from Jay-Z's ''The Dynasty: Roc La Familia''. West has noted Wu-Tang Clan producer RZA as an influence on his style.
West further developed his style on his 2004 debut album, ''The College Dropout''. After a rough version was leaked, West meticulously refined the production, adding string arrangements, gospel choirs, and improved drum programming. The album saw West diverge from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop in favor of more diverse, topical lyrical subjects including higher education, materialism, self-consciousness, minimum-wage labor, institutional prejudice, family, sexuality, and his personal struggles in the music industry.Love, Josh.

West made cameo appearances as himself in the films ''State Property 2'' (2005) and ''The Love Guru'' (2008), and in an episode of the television show ''Entourage'' in 2007. West provided the voice for "Kenny West", a rapper, in the animated sitcom ''The Cleveland Show''.

===Politics===

In September 2015, West announced that he intends to run for President of the United States in 2020. He later implied on Twitter that he intends to run for President in 2024 due to Donald Trump's win in the 2016 elections.{{tweet|text=You don't have to agree with Trump but the mob can't make me not love him.

West previously stated he would have voted for Trump had he voted. In February 2017, however, West deleted all of his tweets about Trump in purported dislike of the new president's policies, particularly the travel ban. West reassured his support for Donald Trump in April 2018 in a text to Ebro Darden where he said "I love Donald Trump... I love Donald Trump." West also posted a picture wearing a Make America Great Again hat alongside a series of tweets defending President Trump. Trump later retweeted several of West's tweets.

Following his return to Twitter in April 2018, West tweeted "I love the way Candace Owens thinks." Owens, who promotes black conservatism, praised President Trump as the savior of the Free World and criticized the Black Lives Matter movement. The tweet was met with controversy among some of West's fans.

==Controversies==

===General media===

West has been an outspoken and controversial celebrity throughout his career, receiving both criticism and praise from many, including the mainstream media, other artists and entertainers, and two U.S. presidents. On September 2, 2005, during a benefit concert for Hurricane Katrina relief on NBC (''A Concert for Hurricane Relief''), he deviated from the prepared script to criticize the media's portrayal of, and the federal response to, black victims of the hurricane. He criticized President George W. Bush for not "car[ing] about black people".West's speech at ''A Concert for Hurricane Relief'': "I hate the way they portray us in the media. You see a black family, it says, 'They're looting.' You see a white family, it says, 'They're looking for food.' And, you know, it's been five days [waiting for federal help] because most of the people are black. And even for me to complain about it, I would be a hypocrite because I've tried to turn away from the TV because it's too hard to watch. I've even been shopping before even giving a donation, so now I'm calling my business manager right now to see what is the biggest amount I can give, and just to imagine if I was down there, and those are my people down there. So anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can helpwith the way America is set up to help the poor, the black people, the less well-off, as slow as possible. I mean, the Red Cross is doing everything they can. We already realize a lot of people that could help are at war right now, fighting another wayand they've given them permission to go down and shoot us!"{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}
 Bush stated in an interview that the comment was "one of the most disgusting moments" of his presidency. In November 2010, in a taped interview with Matt Lauer for the ''Today'' show, West expressed regret for his criticism of Bush. Reactions were mixed, but some felt that West had no need to apologize. "It was not the particulars of your words that mattered, it was the essence of a feeling of the insensitivity towards our communities that many of us have felt for far too long," argued Def Jam co-founder Russell Simmons.

In 2008 he said he will go down in history as "the voice of this generation", a comment that was widely ridiculed, notably in the ''South Park'' episode "Fishsticks".

In September 2013, West was widely rebuked by human rights groups for performing in Kazakhstan, which has one of the poorest human rights records in the world, at the wedding of authoritarian President Nursultan Nazarbayev's grandson.{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} Other notable Western performers, including Sting, have previously cancelled performances in the country over human rights concerns. West was reportedly paid US$3 million for his performance. West had previously participated in cultural boycotts, joining Shakira and Rage Against The Machine in refusing to perform in Arizona after the 2010 implementation of stop and search laws directed against potential illegal aliens.

During a November 26, 2013 radio interview, West explained why he believed that President Obama had problems pushing policies in Washington: "Man, let me tell you something about George Bush and oil money and Obama and no money. People want to say Obama can't make these moves or he's not executing. That's because he ain't got those connections. Black people don't have the same level of connections as Jewish people...We ain't Jewish. We don't got family that got money like that." In response to his comments, the Anti-Defamation League stated: "There it goes again, the age-old canard that Jews are all-powerful and control the levers of power in government."[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/05/kanye-west-anti-semitism_n_4390590.html Kanye West's Week Includes Accusations Of Anti-Semitism, Weak Attendance At Kansas City Gig] by The Huffington Post, Matthew Jacobs, May 12, 2013 On December 21, 2013, West backed off of the original comment and told a Chicago radio station that "I thought I was giving a compliment, but if anything it came off more ignorant. I don't know how being told you have money is an insult."

In February 2016, West again became embroiled in controversy when he posted a tweet seemingly asserting Bill Cosby's innocence in the wake of over 50 women making allegations of sexual assault directed at Cosby.

In May 2018, West caused controversy when he said, "When you hear about slavery for 400 years ... for 400 years? That sounds like a choice. You were there for 400 years and it's all of y'all. It's like we're mentally imprisoned." during an appearance on TMZ. West responded to the controversy on Twitter stating "Of course I know that slaves did not get shackled and put on a boat by free will. My point is for us to have stayed in that position even though the numbers were on our side means that we were mentally enslaved" and "The reason why I brought up the 400 years point is because we can't be mentally imprisoned for another 400 years. We need free thought now. Even the statement was an example of free thought. It was just an idea. Once again I am being attacked for presenting new ideas".

Over the course of his career, West has been known to compare himself to various influential figures and entities in art and culture, including Donald Trump, Steve Jobs, Socrates, Walt Disney, Andy Warhol, Anna Wintour, Michael Jackson, Howard Hughes, Leonardo da Vinci, Nike, Kurt Cobain, William Shakespeare, Axl Rose, Thomas Edison, Pablo Picasso, Jim Morrison, Willy Wonka, David Stern,
Braveheart, Herms, Jimi Hendrix, Michelangelo, Ralph Lauren and Google.

===Award shows===
In 2004, West had his first of a number of public incidents during his attendance at music award events. At the American Music Awards of 2004, West stormed out of the auditorium after losing Best New Artist to country singer Gretchen Wilson. He later commented, "I felt like I was definitely robbed [...] I was the best new artist this year." After the 2006 Grammy nominations were released, West said he would "really have a problem" if he did not win the Album of the Year, saying, "I don't care what I do, I don't care how much I stunt  you can never take away from the amount of work I put into it. I don't want to hear all of that politically correct stuff." On November 2, 2006, when his "Touch the Sky" failed to win Best Video at the MTV Europe Music Awards, West went onto the stage as the award was being presented to Justice and Simian for "We Are Your Friends" and argued that he should have won the award instead. Hundreds of news outlets worldwide criticized the outburst. On November 7, 2006, West apologized for this outburst publicly during his performance as support act for U2 for their Vertigo concert in Brisbane. He later spoofed the incident on the 33rd-season premiere of ''Saturday Night Live'' in September 2007. Episodes {{!}} September 29, 2007 #13|work=SNL Archives|last=Navaroli|first=Joel|date=September 29, 2007|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}

On September 9, 2007, West suggested that his race had something to do with his being overlooked for opening the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs) in favor of Britney Spears; he claimed, "Maybe my skin's not right." West was performing at the event; that night, he lost all five awards that he was nominated for, including Best Male Artist and Video of the Year. After the show, he was visibly upset that he had lost at the VMAs two years in a row, stating that he would not come back to MTV ever again. He also appeared on several radio stations saying that when he made the song "Stronger" that it was his dream to open the VMAs with it. He has also stated that Spears has not had a hit in a long period of time and that MTV exploited her for ratings.

On September 13, 2009, during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards while Taylor Swift was accepting her award for Best Female Video for "You Belong with Me", West went on stage and grabbed the microphone to proclaim that Beyonc's video for "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", nominated for the same award, was "one of the best videos of all time". He was subsequently removed from the remainder of the show for his actions. When Beyonc later won the award for Best Video of the Year for "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", she called Swift up on stage so that she could finish her acceptance speech. West was criticized by various celebrities for the outburst, and by President Barack Obama, who called West a "jackass". In addition, West's VMA disruption sparked a large influx of Internet photo memes with blogs, forums and "tweets" with the "Let you finish" photo-jokes. He posted a Tweet soon after the event where he stated, "Everybody wanna booooo me but I'm a fan of real pop culture... I'm not crazy y'all, I'm just real." He then posted two apologies for the outburst on his personal blog; one on the night of the incident, and the other the following day, when he also apologized during an appearance on ''The Jay Leno Show''. After Swift appeared on ''The View'' two days after the outburst, partly to discuss the matter, West called her to apologize personally. Swift said she accepted his apology. In September 2010, West wrote a series of apologetic tweets addressed to Swift including "Beyonce didn't need that. MTV didn't need that and Taylor and her family friends and fans definitely didn't want or need that" and concluding with "I'm sorry Taylor." He also revealed he had written a song for Swift and if she did not accept the song, he would perform it himself. However, on November 8, 2010, in an interview with a Minnesota radio station, he seemed to recant his past apologies by attempting to describe the act at the 2009 awards show as "selfless" and downgrade the perception of disrespect it created.

On February 8, 2015, at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, West walked on stage as Beck was accepting his award for Album of the Year and then walked off stage, leaving the audience to think he was joking. After the awards show, West stated in an interview that he was not joking and that "Beck needs to respect artistry, he should have given his award to Beyonc". On February 26, 2015, he publicly apologized to Beck on Twitter. On August 30, 2015, West was presented with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the MTV Video Music Awards. In his acceptance speech, he stated, "Y'all might be thinking right now, 'I wonder did he smoke something before he came out here?' And the answer is: 'Yes, I rolled up a little something. I knocked the edge off.'" At the end of his speech, he announced, "I have decided in 2020 to run for president." At the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards West was given four minutes to do "whatever he wanted". He chose to debut his new music video for Fade, but first, delivered a speech in which he discussed recent shootings in Chicago, why he included Ray J and Donald Trump in his Famous video, the Taylor Swift situation, his love of Beyonc and Steve Jobs amongst others.

===Petitions===
Music fans have turned to Change.org around the globe to try and block West's participation at various events. The largest unsuccessful petition has been to the Glastonbury Festival 2015 with 133,000+ voters stating they would prefer a rock band to headline.
On July 20, 2015, within five days of West's announcement as the headlining artist of the closing ceremonies of the 2015 Pan American Games, Change.org user XYZ collected over 50,000 signatures for West's removal as headliner, on the grounds that the headlining artist should be Canadian. In his Pan American Games Closing Ceremony performance, close to the end of his performance, West closed the show by tossing his faulty microphone in the air and walked off stage.

===Relationships and family===
thumb|upright=0.65|West's wife Kim Kardashian, pictured in September 2012
West began an on-and-off relationship with designer Alexis Phifer in 2002, and they became engaged in August 2006. The pair ended their 18-month engagement in 2008. West subsequently dated model Amber Rose from 2008 until the summer of 2010. In April 2012, West began dating reality star and longtime friend Kim Kardashian. West and Kardashian became engaged in October 2013, and married on May 24, 2014 at Fort di Belvedere in Florence, Italy. Their private ceremony was subject to widespread mainstream coverage, with West taking issue with the couple's portrayal in the media.Lee, Christina.

They have three children: daughters North "Nori" West (born June 2013) and Chicago West (born January 2018 of a surrogate pregnancy); and son Saint West (born December 2015). In April 2015, West and Kardashian traveled to Jerusalem to have North baptized in the Armenian Apostolic Church at the Cathedral of St. James. The couple's high-profile status and respective careers have resulted in their relationship becoming subject to heavy media coverage; ''The New York Times'' referred to their marriage as "a historic blizzard of celebrity."Caramanica, Jon.

===Mother's death===
On November 10, 2007, West's mother Donda West died at age 58. In January 2008 the Los Angeles County coroner's office said that West had died of coronary artery disease and multiple post-operative factors from, or as a consequence of, liposuction and mammoplasty".
Donda West in August 2007|thumb|left|upright

West played his first concert following the funeral at The O2 in London on November 22. He dedicated a performance of "Hey Mama", as well as a cover of Journey's "Don't Stop Believin'", to his mother, and did so on all other dates of his Glow in the Dark tour.

California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger subsequently signed the "Donda West Law", legislation which makes it mandatory for patients to receive medical clearance through a physical examination before undergoing elective cosmetic surgery.

===Legal issues===
In December 2006, Robert "Evel" Knievel sued West for trademark infringement in West's video for "Touch the Sky". Knievel took issue with a "sexually charged video" in which West takes on the persona of "Evel Kanyevel" and attempts flying a rocket over a canyon. The suit claimed infringement on Knievel's trademarked name and likeness. Knievel also claimed that the "vulgar and offensive" images depicted in the video damaged his reputation. The suit sought monetary damages and an injunction to stop distribution of the video. West's attorneys argued that the music video amounted to satire and therefore was covered under the First Amendment. Just days before his death in November 2007, Knievel amicably settled the suit after being paid a visit from West, saying, "I thought he was a wonderful guy and quite a gentleman."

In 2014, after an altercation with a paparazzo at Los Angeles Airport, West was sentenced to serve two years' probation for a misdemeanor battery conviction, and was required to attend 24 anger management sessions, perform 250 hours of community service, and pay restitution to the photographer.

===Religious beliefs===
After the success of his song "Jesus Walks" from the album ''The College Dropout'', West was questioned on his beliefs and said, "I will say that I'm spiritual. I have accepted Jesus as my Savior. And I will say that I fall short every day." In a 2008 interview with ''The Fader'', West stated that "I'm like a vessel, and God has chosen me to be the voice and the connector."

In a 2009 interview with online magazine Bossip, West clarified that he believed in God, but "would never go into a religion," explaining that "I feel like religion is more about separation and judgment than bringing people together and understanding. That's all I'm about." However, in 2014, West referred to himself as a Christian during one of his concerts.

===Mental health===

In 2010, for a screening of his movie ''Runaway'', West told the audience he once considered suicide. In his song "FML" and his featured verse on Vic Mensa's song "U Mad", he refers to using the antidepressant medication Lexapro, and in his song "I Feel Like That", which has not been officially released, he mentions feeling many common symptoms of depression and anxiety. These songs had all been recorded during West's recording sessions for ''The Life of Pablo''.

On November 20, 2016, soon before abruptly ending a concert prematurely, he said, "Jay-Zcall me, bruh. You still ain't called me. Jay-Z, I know you got killers. Please don't send them at my head. Please call me. Talk to me like a man." The following day, he was committed to the UCLA Medical Center with hallucinations and paranoia. Contrary to what early reports said, however, West was not actually taken to the hospital involuntarily; he was persuaded to do so by authorities. While the episode was first described as one of "temporary psychosis" caused by dehydration and sleep deprivation, West's mental state was abnormal enough for his 21 cancelled concerts to be covered by his insurance policy; he was reportedly paranoid and depressed throughout the hospitalization, but remains formally undiagnosed. Some have speculated that the Paris robbery of his wife may have triggered the paranoia. On November 30, West was released from the hospital. 

In an interview in 2018, West declared that he became addicted to opioids when they were prescribed to him after he got liposuction. The addiction contributed to his nervous breakdown in 2016. On the album ''Ye,'' West implied that he had bipolar disorder and compared it to a "superpower"; these allusions followed rumors that West was diagnosed with the disorder.

{{Quote box. 
quote=Mr. West has had the most sui generis hip-hop career of the last decade. No rapper has embodied hip-hop's often contradictory impulses of narcissism and social good quite as he has, and no producer has celebrated the lush and the ornate quite as he has. He has spent most of his career in additive mode, figuring out how to make music that's majestic and thought-provoking and grand-scaled. And he's also widened the genre's gates, whether for middle-class values or high-fashion and high-art dreams..

West is among the most critically acclaimed artists of the twenty-first century, receiving praise from music critics, fans, fellow musicians, artists, and wider cultural figures for his work.Rucker, CJ. [https://web.archive.org/web/20160221005026/http://hypetrak.com/2016/02/kanye-west-the-life-of-pablo-review/ "How We Heard Kanye West's 'The Life Of Pablo'.So Far"]. Hypetrak. HB Network. Retrieved February 22, 2016. AllMusic editor Jason Birchmeier writes of his impact, "As his career progressed throughout the early 21st century, West shattered certain stereotypes about rappers, becoming a superstar on his own terms without adapting his appearance, his rhetoric, or his music to fit any one musical mold." Jon Caramanica of ''The New York Times'' said that West has been "a frequent lightning rod for controversy, a bombastic figure who can count rankling two presidents among his achievements." Village Voice Media senior editor Ben Westhoff dubbed him the greatest hip hop artist of all time, writing that "he's made the best albums and changed the game the most, and his music is the most likely to endure," while ''Complex'' called him the 21st century's "most important artist of any art form, of any genre." In 2016, ''The Guardian'' compared West to David Bowie within the "modern mainstream", arguing that "there is nobody else who can sell as many records as West does [...] while remaining so resolutely experimental and capable of stirring things up culturally and politically."

''Rolling Stone'' credited West with transforming hip hop's mainstream, "establishing a style of introspective yet glossy rap [...]", and called him "as interesting and complicated a pop star as the 2000s produceda rapper who mastered, upped and moved beyond the hip-hop game, a producer who created a signature sound and then abandoned it to his imitators, a flashy, free-spending sybarite with insightful things to say about college, culture and economics, an egomaniac with more than enough artistic firepower to back it up." West's middle-class background, flamboyant fashion sense and outspokenness have set him apart from other rappers. Early in his career, he was among the first rappers to publicly criticize the preponderance of homophobia in hip hop. The sales competition between rapper 50 Cent's ''Curtis'' and West's ''Graduation'' altered the direction of hip hop and helped pave the way for new rappers who did not follow the hardcore-gangster mold. Rosie Swash of ''The Guardian'' viewed the sales competition as a historical moment in hip-hop, because it "highlighted the diverging facets of hip-hop in the last decade; the former was gangsta rap for the noughties, while West was the thinking man's alternative."Swash, Rosie (June 13, 2011). [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/13/kanye-vs-50-cent Kanye v 50 Cent]. ''The Guardian''. Guardian News and Media Limited. Retrieved August 9, 2011. West's 2008 album ''808s & Heartbreak'' polarized listeners upon its release, but was commercially successful and impacted hip hop and pop stylistically, as it laid the groundwork for a new wave of artists who generally eschewed typical rap braggadocio for intimate subject matter and introspection, including Frank Ocean, The Weeknd, Drake, Future, Kid Cudi, Childish Gambino, Lil Durk, Chief Keef, and Soulja Boy.Rabin, Nathan. [http://www.avclub.com/articles/drake-thank-me-later,42125/ Review: ''Thank Me Later'']. ''The A.V. Club''. Retrieved June 15, 2010. According to Ben Detrick of ''XXL'' magazine, West effectively led a new wave of artists, including Kid Cudi, Wale, Lupe Fiasco, Kidz in the Hall, and Drake, who lacked the interest or ability to rap about gunplay or drug-dealing. In 2013, Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of ''Spin'' described West as fronting a "new art-pop era" in contemporary music, in which musicians draw widely on the visual arts as a signifier of both creative exploration and extravagant wealth.

A substantial number of artists and other figures have professed admiration for West's work, including hip hop artists Rakim, RZA of Wu-Tang Clan, Chuck D of Public Enemy, and DJ Premier of Gang Starr. Experimental rock pioneer and Velvet Underground founder Lou Reed said of West that "the guy really, really, ''really'' is talented. He's really trying to raise the bar. No one's near doing what he's doing, it's not even on the same planet." Musicians such as Paul McCartney and Prince have also commended West's work. Famed Tesla Motors CEO and inventor Elon Musk complimented West in a piece for ''Time'''s 100 most influential people list, writing that:

Kanye West would be the first person to tell you he belongs on this list. The dude doesn't believe in false modesty, and he shouldn't [...] He fought for his place in the cultural pantheon with a purpose. In his debut album, over a decade ago, Kanye issued what amounted to a social critique and a call to arms (with a beat): "We rappers is role models: we rap, we don't think." But Kanye does think. Constantly. About everything. And he wants everybody else to do the same: to engage, question, push boundaries. Now that he's a pop-culture juggernaut, he has the platform to achieve just that. He's not afraid of being judged or ridiculed in the process. Kanye's been playing the long game all along, and we're only just beginning to see why.

Drake, Nicki Minaj, Lil Uzi Vert and Casey Veggies have acknowledged being influenced directly by West. Non-rap artists such as English singer-songwriters Adele and Lily Allen, New Zealand artist Lorde, American electropop singer Halsey, English rock band Arctic Monkeys, Sergio Pizzorno of English rock band Kasabian and the American indie rock bands MGMT and Yeah Yeah Yeahs have cited West as an influence. Experimental and electronic artists such as James Blake Daniel Lopatin, and Tim Hecker have also cited West's work as an inspiration.
