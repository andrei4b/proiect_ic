'''Francis Albert Sinatra''' ({{IPAc-en|s|||n||t|r|}}; December 12, 1915  May 14, 1998) was an American singer, actor, and producer who was one of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century. He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150{{nbsp}}million records worldwide. Born in Hoboken, New Jersey, to Italian immigrants, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the "bobby soxers". He released his debut album, ''The Voice of Frank Sinatra'', in 1946. Sinatra's professional career had stalled by the early 1950s, and he turned to Las Vegas, where he became one of its best known residency performers as part of the Rat Pack. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of ''From Here to Eternity'', with his performance subsequently winning an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra released several critically lauded albums, including ''In the Wee Small Hours'' (1955), ''Songs for Swingin' Lovers!'' (1956), ''Come Fly with Me'' (1958), ''Only the Lonely'' (1958) and ''Nice 'n' Easy'' (1960).

Sinatra left Capitol in 1960 to start his own record label, Reprise Records, and released a string of successful albums. In 1965, he recorded the retrospective ''September of My Years'' and starred in the Emmy-winning television special ''Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music''. After releasing ''Sinatra at the Sands'', recorded at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Vegas with frequent collaborator Count Basie in early 1966, the following year he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Tom Jobim, the album ''Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim''. It was followed by 1968's ''Francis A. & Edward K.'' with Duke Ellington. Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971, but came out of retirement two years later and recorded several albums and resumed performing at Caesars Palace, and reached success in 1980 with "New York, New York". Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured both within the United States and internationally until shortly before his death in 1998.

Sinatra forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award for ''From Here to Eternity'', he starred in ''The Man with the Golden Arm'' (1955), and received critical acclaim for his performance in ''The Manchurian Candidate'' (1962). He appeared in various musicals such as ''On the Town'' (1949), ''Guys and Dolls'' (1955), ''High Society'' (1956), and ''Pal Joey'' (1957), winning another Golden Globe for the latter. Toward the end of his career, he became associated with playing detectives, including the title character in ''Tony Rome'' (1967). Sinatra would later receive the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1971. On television, ''The Frank Sinatra Show'' began on ABC in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Sinatra was also heavily involved with politics from the mid-1940s, and actively campaigned for presidents such as Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. Despite his political connections, the FBI investigated Sinatra and his alleged relationship with the Mafia.

While Sinatra never learned how to read music, he had an impressive understanding of it, and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music. A perfectionist, renowned for his dress sense and performing presence, he always insisted on recording live with his band. His bright blue eyes earned him the popular nickname "Ol' Blue Eyes". Sinatra led a colorful personal life, and was often involved in turbulent affairs with women, such as with his second wife Ava Gardner. He went on to marry Mia Farrow in 1966 and Barbara Marx in 1976. Sinatra had several violent confrontations, usually with journalists he felt had crossed him, or work bosses with whom he had disagreements. He was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. After his death, American music critic Robert Christgau called him "the greatest singer of the 20th century", and he continues to be seen as an iconic figure.{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=1}}

Francis Albert Sinatra{{efn|On his original birth certificate, Sinatra's name was recorded incorrectly as "Frank Sinestro", a clerical error.

It was opened as a museum by Ed Shirak in 2001, but closed after five years due to maintenance issues.}} He was the only child of Italian immigrants Antonino Martino "Marty" Sinatra{{Sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=3}} and Natalina "Dolly" Garaventa.{{sfn|Petkov|Mustazza|1995|p=113}}{{efn|Other sources incorrectly say Catania.{{sfnm|1a1=Howlett|1y=1980|1p=5|2a1=Summers|2a2=Swan|2y=2010|2pp=2225|3a1=Kaplan|3y=2011|3p=8: 415 Monroe Street}}}} Sinatra weighed {{convert|13.5|lbs}} at birth and had to be delivered with the aid of forceps, which caused severe scarring to his left cheek, neck, and ear, and perforated his eardrum, damage that remained for life.{{sfnm|1a1=Kelley|1y=1986|1p=13|2a1=Travis|2y=2001|2p=1|3a1=Turner|3y=2004|3p=4}} Due to his injuries at birth, his baptism at St. Francis Church in Hoboken was delayed until April 2, 1916.{{sfn|Sinatra|1995|p=16}} A childhood operation on his mastoid bone left major scarring on his neck, and during adolescence he suffered from cystic acne that scarred his face and neck.{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|pp=45}} Sinatra was raised Roman Catholic.

Sinatra's mother was energetic and driven,{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|p=6}} and biographers believe that she was the dominant factor in the development of her son's personality traits and self-confidence.{{Sfnm|1a1=Rojek|1y=2004|1p=25|2a1=Santopietro|2y=2008|2p=15}} Barbara Sinatra claims that Dolly was abusive to him as a child, and "knocked him around a lot".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=86}} Dolly became influential in Hoboken and in local Democratic Party circles.{{sfn|Sann|1967|p=351}} She worked as a midwife, earning $50 for each delivery,{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|pp=89}} and according to Sinatra biographer Kitty Kelley, also ran an illegal abortion service that catered to Italian Catholic girls, for which she was nicknamed "Hatpin Dolly".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=28}}{{efn|Dolly was reportedly arrested six or seven times and convicted twice for providing illegal abortions,{{sfnm|1a1=Kuntz|1a2=Kuntz|1y=2000|1p=36|2a1=Summers|2a2=Swan|2y=2010|2p=16}} the first of which was in 1937.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=29}}}} She also had a gift for languages and served as a local interpreter.{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|pp=6, 89}}  Sinatra's illiterate father was a bantamweight boxer who fought under the name Marty O'Brien.{{sfnm|1a1=Howlett|1y=1980|1p=5|2a1=Kaplan|2y=2011|2p=7}} He later worked for 24 years at the Hoboken Fire Department, working his way up to captain.{{sfn|Goldstein|1982|p=2}} Sinatra spent much time at his parents' tavern in Hoboken,{{efn|In 1920, Prohibition of alcohol became law in the US.

Sinatra developed an interest in music, particularly big band jazz, at a young age.{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=135}} He listened to Gene Austin, Rudy Valle, Russ Colombo, and Bob Eberly, and idolized Bing Crosby.{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=56}} Sinatra's maternal uncle, Domenico, gave him a ukulele for his 15th birthday, and he began performing at family gatherings.{{sfn|Donnelley|2003|p=642}} Sinatra attended David E.

===Hoboken Four and Harry James (19351939)===
thumb|right|Sinatra (''far right'') with the Hoboken Four on Major Bowes' Amateur Hour in 1935
Sinatra began singing professionally as a teenager, but he learned music by ear and never learned to read music.{{sfn|Young|Young|2007|p=474}} He got his first break in 1935 when his mother persuaded a local singing group, the 3 Flashes, to let him join. Fred Tamburro, the group's baritone, stated that "Frank hung around us like we were gods or something", admitting that they only took him on board because he owned a car{{efn|Nancy Sinatra notes that he owned a Chrysler and people would show amazement that such a young kid could afford it.{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=18}}}} and could chauffeur the group around. Sinatra soon learned they were auditioning for the ''Major Bowes Amateur Hour'' show, and "begged" the group to let him in on the act.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=39}} With Sinatra, the group became known as the Hoboken Four, and passed an audition from Edward Bowes to appear on the ''Major Bowes Amateur Hour'' show. They each earned $12.50 for the appearance,{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=25}} and ended up attracting 40,000 votes and won first prizea six-month contract to perform on stage and radio across the United States.{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=40}} Sinatra quickly became the group's lead singer, and, much to the jealousy of his fellow group members, garnered most of the attention from girls.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=42}}{{efn|The jealousy exhibited by the group members often led to brawls in which they would beat up the small, skinny young Sinatra.{{sfn|Quirk|Schoell|1999|pp=1920}}}} Due to the success of the group, Bowes kept asking for them to return, disguised under different names, varying from "The Seacaucus Cockamamies" to "The Bayonne Bacalas".
thumb|left|upright|Harry James in 1942
In 1938, Sinatra found employment as a singing waiter at a roadhouse called "The Rustic Cabin" in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, for which he was paid $15 a week.{{sfnm|1a1=Hodge|1y=1992|1p=11|2a1=Rojek|2y=2004|2p=41}} The roadhouse was connected to the WNEW radio station in New York City, and he began performing with a group live during the ''Dance Parade'' show.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=27}} Despite the low salary, Sinatra felt that this was the break he was looking for, and boasted to friends that he was going to "become so big that no one could ever touch him".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=46}} In March 1939, saxophone player Frank Mane, who knew Sinatra from Jersey City radio station WAAT where both performed on live broadcasts, arranged for him to audition and record "Our Love", his first solo studio recording.{{efn| Only one copy of this recording was made, a 78rpm disc. Mane wrote "Frank Sinatra" on the record label and kept the recording in a drawer through the years, giving Sinatra a copy on a cassette tape as a gift in 1979. Mane died in 1998, only months after Sinatra's death; in 2006, Mane's widow offered the recording for sale through Gurnsey's auction house in New York.}} In June, bandleader Harry James, who had heard Sinatra sing on "Dance Parade",
signed a two-year contract of $75 a week one evening after a show at the Paramount Theatre in New York.{{sfnm|1a1=Kelley|1y=1986|1p=53|2a1=Ingham|2y=2005|2p=9}}{{efn|The only sticking point was that James wanted Sinatra to change his name to Frankie Satin, as he thought that Sinatra sounded too Italian.{{sfn|Rotella|2010|p=8}} Neither Sinatra, nor his mother, would agree to this; he told James that his cousin, Ray Sinatra, was a bandleader in Boston, kept his own name and was doing well with it. James knew of Ray Sinatra, so he did not press the issue.}} It was with the James band that Sinatra released his first commercial record "From the Bottom of My Heart" in July. No more than 8,000 copies of the record were sold,{{sfn|Petkov|Mustazza|1995|p=85}} and further records released with James through 1939, such as "All or Nothing At All", also had weak sales on their initial release. Thanks to his vocal training, Sinatra could now sing two tones higher, and developed a repertoire which included songs such as "My Buddy", "Willow Weep for Me", "It's Funny to Everyone But Me", "Here Comes the Night", "On a Little Street in Singapore", "Ciribiribin", and "Every Day of My Life".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=55}}

thumb|left|Tommy Dorsey in ''The Fabulous Dorseys'' (1947)
Sinatra became increasingly frustrated with the status of the Harry James band, feeling that he was not achieving the major success and acclaim he was looking for. His pianist and close friend Hank Sanicola persuaded him to stay with the group,{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=54}} but in November 1939 he left James to replace Jack Leonard{{efn|the vocalist, not to be confused with the comedian Jack E. Leonard.}} as the lead singer of the Tommy Dorsey band. Sinatra signed a contract with Dorsey for $125 a week at Palmer House in Chicago,{{sfn|Wood|1996|p=135}} and James agreed amicably to release Sinatra from his contract.{{Pop Chronicles 40s|1|A}}{{efn|Sinatra acknowledged his debt to James throughout his life, and upon hearing of James' death in 1983, stated: "he is the one that made it all possible."{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=24}}}} On January 26, 1940, he made his first public appearance with the band at the Coronado Theatre in Rockford, Illinois,{{sfn|Silva|2000|p=12}} opening the show with "Stardust".{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=94}} Dorsey recalled: "You could almost feel the excitement coming up out of the crowds when the kid stood up to sing. Remember, he was no matine idol. He was just a skinny kid with big ears. I used to stand there so amazed I'd almost forget to take my own solos".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|pp=5960}} Dorsey was a major influence on Sinatra and became a father figure. Sinatra copied Dorsey's mannerisms and traits, becoming a demanding perfectionist like him, even adopting his hobby of toy trains. He asked Dorsey to be godfather to his daughter Nancy in June 1940.{{sfnm|1a1=Kelley|1y=1986|1pp=5960|2a1=Lahr|2y=2000|2p=59}} Sinatra later said that "The only two people I've ever been afraid of are my mother and Tommy Dorsey".{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|p=1}} Though Kelley claims that Sinatra and drummer Buddy Rich were bitter rivals,{{efn|Kelley claims that arguments and fights regularly broke out between Sinatra and Rich, who were both arrogant with volatile tempers. In one incident witnessed by Stafford backstage at the Astor Hotel in New York, Rich called Sinatra a name and Sinatra threw a heavy glass pitcher filled with water and ice at Rich's head. In another incident at the Golden Gate Theater in San Francisco, Rich reportedly attempted to ram Sinatra against the wall with his high F cymbal.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=5859}}}} other authors state that they were friends and even roommates when the band was on the road, but professional jealousy surfaced as both men wanted to be considered the star of Dorsey's band. Later, Sinatra helped Rich form his own band with a $25,000 loan and provided financial help to Rich during times of the drummer's serious illness.{{sfnm|1a1=Shaw|1y=1968|1p=34|2a1=Consiglio|2a2=Douskey|2y=2011|2p=135}}

In his first year with Dorsey, Sinatra recorded over forty songs. Sinatra's first vocal hit was the song "Polka Dots and Moonbeams" in late April 1940.{{sfn|Whitburn|1986|p=136}} Two more chart appearances followed with "Say It" and "Imagination", which was Sinatra's first top-10 hit.{{sfn|Whitburn|1986|p=136}} His fourth chart appearance was "I'll Never Smile Again", topping the charts for twelve weeks beginning in mid-July.{{sfnm|1a1=Whitburn|1y=1986|1p=136|2a1=Summers|2a2=Swan|2y=2010|2p=91}} Other records with Tommy Dorsey issued by RCA Victor include "Our Love Affair" and "Stardust" in 1940; "Oh! Look at Me Now", "Dolores", "Everything Happens to Me", and "This Love of Mine" in 1941; "Just as Though You Were There", "Take Me", and "There Are Such Things" in 1942; and "It Started All Over Again", "In the Blue of Evening", and "It's Always You" in 1943.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=567568}} As his success and popularity grew, Sinatra pushed Dorsey to allow him to record some solo songs. Dorsey eventually relented, and on January 19, 1942, Sinatra recorded "Night and Day", "The Night We Called It a Day", "The Song is You", and "Lamplighter's Serenade" at a Bluebird recording session, with Axel Stordahl as arranger and conductor.{{sfnm|1a1=Kelley|1y=1986|1p=67|2a1=Lees|2y=1998|2p=97}} Sinatra first heard the recordings at the Hollywood Palladium and Hollywood Plaza and was astounded at how good he sounded. Stordahl recalled: "He just couldn't believe his ears. He was so excited, you almost believed he had never recorded before. I think this was a turning point in his career. I think he began to see what he might do on his own".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=67}}

After the 1942 recordings, Sinatra believed he needed to go solo,{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=6768}} with an insatiable desire to compete with Bing Crosby,{{efn|Sinatra said: "The reason I wanted to leave Tommy's band was that Crosby was Number One, way up on top of the pile. In the open field, you might say, were some awfully good singers with the orchestras. Bob Eberly (with Jimmy Dorsey) was a fabulous vocalist. Mr. Como (with Ted Weems) is such a wonderful singer. I thought, if I don't make a move out of this and try to do it on my own soon, one of those guys will do it, and I'll have to fight all three of them to get a position".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=60}}}} but he was hampered by his contract which gave Dorsey 43% of Sinatra's lifetime earnings in the entertainment industry.{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=60}}  A legal battle ensued, eventually settled in August 1943.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=70}}{{efn|Sinatra's lawyer, Henry Jaffe, met with Dorsey's lawyer N. Joseph Ross in Los Angeles in August 1943. In the words of Kelley: "In the end, MCA, an agency representing Dorsey and courting Sinatra, made Dorsey a $60,000 offer that he accepted. To obtain Frank as a client, the agency paid Dorsey $35,000 while Sinatra paid $25,000, which he borrowed from Manie Sacks as an advance against his royalties from Columbia Records. MCA agreed that until 1948 it would split its commissions on Sinatra with GAC, the agency that Frank had signed with when he left the Dorsey band."{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=70}} However, during a 1979 concert at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles, Sinatra claimed that it took him years to escape the contract, and that Dorsey had cost him seven million dollars.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=72}}}} On September 3, 1942, Dorsey bade farewell to Sinatra, reportedly saying as Sinatra left, "I hope you fall on your ass".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=60}} He replaced Sinatra with singer Dick Haymes. Rumors began spreading in newspapers that Sinatra's mobster godfather, Willie Moretti, coerced Dorsey to let Sinatra out of his contract for a few thousand dollars, holding a gun to his head.{{sfn|Anastasia|Macnow|Pistone|2011|p=301}}{{efn|The incident started rumors of Sinatra's involvement with the Mafia, and was fictionalized in the book and film ''The Godfather''.{{sfn|Levinson|2009|p=161}}}} Sinatra persuaded Stordahl to leave Dorsey with him and become his personal arranger, offering him $650 a month, five times the salary of Dorsey.{{Sfn|Goldstein|1982|p=9}} Dorsey and Sinatra, who had been very close, never patched up their differences before Dorsey's death in 1956, worsened by the fact that Dorsey occasionally made biting comments to the press such as "he's the most fascinating man in the world, but don't put your hand in the cage".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=71}}

===Onset of Sinatramania and role in World War II (19421945)===
By May 1941, Sinatra topped the male singer polls in ''Billboard'' and ''Down Beat'' magazines.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=94}} His appeal to bobby soxers, as teenage girls of that time were called, revealed a whole new audience for popular music, which had been recorded mainly for adults up to that time. The phenomenon became officially known as "Sinatramania" after his "legendary opening" at the Paramount Theatre in New York on December 30, 1942.{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=60}} According to Nancy Sinatra, Jack Benny later said, "I thought the goddamned building was going to cave in. I never heard such a commotion... All this for a fellow I never heard of."{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=44}} Sinatra performed for four weeks at the theatre, his act following the Benny Goodman orchestra, after which his contract was renewed for another four weeks by Bob Weitman due to his popularity.

Of the nine songs recorded during these sessions, seven charted on the best-selling list. That year he also made his first solo nightclub appearance at New York's Riobamba,{{sfn|Kaplan|2010|pp=8889}} and a successful concert in the Wedgewood Room of the prestigious Waldorf-Astoria New York that year secured his popularity in New York high society.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=9395}} Sinatra released "You'll Never Know", "Close to You", "Sunday, Monday, or Always" and "People Will Say We're in Love" as singles.

Sinatra did not serve in the military during World War II. On December 11, 1943, he was officially classified 4-F ("Registrant not acceptable for military service") by his draft board because of a perforated eardrum. However, U.S. Army files reported that Sinatra was "not acceptable material from a psychiatric viewpoint", but his emotional instability was hidden to avoid "undue unpleasantness for both the selectee and the induction service".{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=45}} Briefly, there were rumors reported by columnist Walter Winchell that Sinatra paid $40,000 to avoid the service, but the FBI found this to be without merit.{{sfn|Newton|2003|p=314}} Frank Sinatra|publisher=FBI|location=USA|accessdate=October 20, 2015}} Toward the end of the war, Sinatra entertained the troops during several successful overseas USO tours with comedian Phil Silvers.{{sfn|Andrews|Gilbert|1993|p=293}} During one trip to Rome he met the Pope, who asked him if he was an operatic tenor.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=115116}}  Sinatra worked frequently with the popular Andrews Sisters in radio in the 1940s,{{sfn|Nimmo|2004|p=228}} and many USO shows were broadcast to troops via the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS).{{sfn|Sforza|2015|p=80}} In 1944 Sinatra released "I Couldn't Sleep a Wink Last Night" as a single and recorded his own version of Crosby's "White Christmas", and the following year he released "I Dream of You (More Than You Dream I Do)", "Saturday Night (Is the Loneliest Night of the Week)", "Dream", and "Nancy (with the Laughing Face)" as singles.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=568}}

Despite being heavily involved in political activity in 1945 and 1946, in those two years Sinatra sang on 160 radio shows, recorded 36 times, and shot four films. By 1946 he was performing on stage up to 45 times a week, singing up to 100 songs daily, and earning up to $93,000 a week.{{Sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=150}}

In 1946 Sinatra released "Oh! What it Seemed to Be", "Day by Day", "They Say It's Wonderful", "Five Minutes More", and "The Coffee Song" as singles,{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=569}} and launched his first album, ''The Voice of Frank Sinatra'',{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=43}}  which reached No. 1 on the Billboard chart. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic wrote that Sinatra "took the material very seriously, singing the love lyrics with utter seriousness", and that his "singing and the classically influenced settings gave the songs unusual depth of meaning". He was soon selling ten million records a year.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=129}} Such was Sinatra's command at Columbia that his love of conducting was indulged with the release of the set ''Frank Sinatra Conducts the Music of Alec Wilder'', an offering unlikely to appeal to Sinatra's core fanbase at the time, which consisted of teenage girls.{{sfn|Gigliotti|2002|p=21}} The following year he released his second album, ''Songs by Sinatra'', featuring songs of a similar mood and tempo such as Irving Berlin's "How Deep is the Ocean?" and Harold Arlen's and Jerome Kern's "All The Things You Are".{{sfn|Osborne|2014|p=98}} "Mam'selle", composed by Edmund Goulding with lyrics by Mack Gordon for the film ''The Razor's Edge'' (1946),{{Sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=236}} was released as a single.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=569}} Sinatra had competition; versions by Art Lund, Dick Haymes, Dennis Day, and The Pied Pipers also reached the top ten of the ''Billboard'' charts. In December he recorded "Sweet Lorraine" with the Metronome All-Stars, featuring talented jazz musicians such as Coleman Hawkins, Harry Carney and Charlie Shavers, with Nat King Cole on piano, in what Charles L. Granata describes as "one of the highlights of Sinatra's Columbia epoch".{{Sfn|Granata|2003|p=50}}

Sinatra's third album, ''Christmas Songs by Sinatra'', was originally released in 1948 as a 78rpm album set,{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=4748}} and a 10" LP record was released two years later.{{sfn|Larkin|2002|p=397}} When Sinatra was featured as a priest in ''The Miracle of the Bells'', due to press negativity surrounding his alleged Mafia connections at the time,{{efn|Sinatra was spotted in Havana in 1946 with mobster Lucky Luciano, which started a series of negative press articles, implicating Sinatra with the Mafia.{{sfn|Hanna|1998|p=21}} In 1947 he was involved in a violent incident with journalist Lee Mortimer, who had written some of the most scathing articles on his alleged connections. Kelley claims that his articles grew so offensive that Sinatra pounced on him outside Ciro's and punched him behind the left ear in response to an insult in which he was called a "dago". Sinatra was taken to court, and according to Kelley, Mortimer received Mafia threats to drop the case or lose his life.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=139141}}}} it was announced to the public that Sinatra would donate his $100,000 in wages from the film to the Catholic Church.{{sfn|Hanna|1998|p=21}} By the end of 1948, Sinatra had slipped to fourth on ''Down Beat'''s annual poll of most popular singers (behind Billy Eckstine, Frankie Laine, and Bing Crosby).{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=149}} and in the following year he was pushed out of the top spots in polls for the first time since 1943.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=158}} ''Frankly Sentimental'' (1949) was panned by ''Down Beat'', who commented that "for all his talent, it seldom comes to life".{{Sfn|Shaw|1968|p=131}}

Though "The Hucklebuck" reached the top ten,{{Sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=301}} it was his last single release under the Columbia label.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=569}} Sinatra's last two albums with Columbia, ''Dedicated to You'' and ''Sing and Dance with Frank Sinatra'', were released in 1950.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=218}} Sinatra would later feature a number of the ''Sing and Dance with Frank Sinatra'' album's songs, including "Lover", "It's Only a Paper Moon", "It All Depends on You", on his 1961 Capitol release, ''Sinatra's Swingin' Session!!!''.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=67}}

Cementing the low of his career was the death of publicist George Evans from a heart attack in January 1950 at 48. According to Jimmy Van Heusen, Sinatra's close friend and songwriter, Evans's death to him was "an enormous shock which defies words", as he had been crucial to his career and popularity with the bobbysoxers.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=161}} Sinatra's reputation continued to decline as reports broke out in February of his affair with Ava Gardner and the destruction of his marriage to Nancy,{{sfn|Small|2009|p=59}} though he insisted that his marriage had long been over even before he had met Gardner.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=162}} In April, Sinatra was engaged to perform at the Copa club in New York, but had to cancel five days of the booking due to suffering a submucosal hemorrhage of the throat.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=168169}} Evans once said that whenever Sinatra suffered from a bad throat and loss of voice it was always due to emotional tension which "absolutely destroyed him".{{Sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=151}}

In financial difficulty following his divorce and career decline, Sinatra was forced to borrow $200,000 from Columbia to pay his back taxes after MCA refused to front the money.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=172}} Rejected by Hollywood, he turned to Las Vegas and made his debut at the Desert Inn in September 1951,{{sfn|Shaw|1982|p=48}} and also began singing at the Riverside Hotel in Reno, Nevada. Sinatra became one of Las Vegas's pioneer residency entertainers,  and a prominent figure on the Vegas scene throughout the 1950s and 1960s onwards, a period described by Rojek as the "high-water mark" of Sinatra's "hedonism and self absorption". Rojek notes that the Rat Pack "provided an outlet for gregarious banter and wisecracks", but argues that it was Sinatra's vehicle, possessing an "unassailable command over the other performers".{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=136}} Sinatra would fly to Las Vegas from Los Angeles in Van Heusen's single-engine plane.{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=97}} On October 4, 1953, Sinatra made his first performance at the Sands Hotel and Casino, after an invitation by the manager Jack Entratter,{{sfn|Clarke|2004|p=189}} who had previously worked at the Copa in New York.{{sfn|Ainlay|Gabaldon|2003|p=108}} Sinatra typically performed there three times a year, and later acquired a share in the hotel.{{sfnm|1a1=Kelley|1y=1986|1p=243|2a1=Kaplan|2y=2011|2p=656}}{{efn|Sinatra bought a two percent share in the hotel for $54,000.{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|p=656}} At one point the share reached nine percent.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=245}} He was reportedly ordered to sell his interest in the Sands in 1963, due to his association with mobster Sam Giancana. {{Open access}}}}

Sinatra's decline in popularity was evident at his concert appearances. At a brief run at the Paramount in New York he drew small audiences.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=164}} At the Desert Inn in Las Vegas he performed to half-filled houses of wildcatters and ranchers.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=529}} At a concert at Chez Paree in Chicago, only 150 people in a 1,200-seat capacity venue turned up to see him.{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|p=529}} By April 1952 he was performing at the Kauai County Fair in Hawaii.{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=93}} Sinatra's relationship with Columbia Records was also disintegrating, with A&R executive Mitch Miller claiming he "couldn't give away" the singer's records.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=164}}{{efn|Miller tried to offset Sinatra's declining record sales by introducing "gimmicky novel tunes" into the singer's repertoire such as "Mama Will Bark" to appeal to younger audiences.{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|pp=476477}} "Mama Will Bark" is often cited as the worst of Sinatra's career. Miller thought he would try this novelty approach for Sinatra because he felt the singer's "great records" weren't selling.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=74}}  Initially, Sinatra went along with this approach, but eventually he came to resent Miller for the poor quality of material he was being offered.{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|pp=476, 509}}}} Though several notable recordings were made during this time period, such as "If I Could Write a Book" in January 1952, which Granata sees as a "turning point", forecasting his later work with its sensitivity,{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=74}} Columbia and MCA dropped him later that year.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=76}} His last studio recording for Columbia, "Why Try To Change Me Now", was recorded in New York on September 17, 1952, with orchestra arranged and conducted by Percy Faith.{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|p=535}}  Journalist Burt Boyar observed, "Sinatra had had it.

The release of the film ''From Here to Eternity'' in August 1953 marked the beginning of a remarkable career revival.{{sfn|Kidder|Oppenheim|2008|p=157}} Santopietro notes that Sinatra began to bury himself in his work, with an "unparalleled frenetic schedule of recordings, movies and concerts",{{Sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=187}} in what authors Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan describe as "a new and brilliant phase".{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=188}} On March 13, 1953, Sinatra met with Capitol Records vice president Alan Livingston and signed a seven-year recording contract.{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|pp=601}} His first session for Capitol took place at KHJ studios at Studio C, 5515 Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles, with Axel Stordahl conducting.{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|pp=604, 615}} The session produced four recordings, including "I'm Walking Behind You",{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|p=604}} Sinatra's first Capitol single.{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=101}} After spending two weeks on location in Hawaii filming ''From Here to Eternity'', Sinatra returned to KHJ on April 30 for his first recording session with Nelson Riddle, an established arranger and conductor at Capitol who was Nat King Cole's musical director.{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|pp=614615, 618}} After recording the first song, "I've Got the World on a String", Sinatra offered Riddle a rare expression of praise, "Beautiful!",{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|p=616}} and after listening to the playbacks, he could not hide his enthusiasm, exclaiming, "I'm back, baby, I'm back!"{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=191}}

In subsequent sessions in May and November 1953,{{sfn|Kline|1990|p=33}} Sinatra and Riddle developed and refined their musical collaboration, with Sinatra providing specific guidance on the arrangements.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=191}} Sinatra's first album for Capitol, ''Songs for Young Lovers'', was released on January 4, 1954, and included "A Foggy Day", "I Get a Kick Out of You", "My Funny Valentine", "Violets for Your Furs" and "They Can't Take That Away from Me",{{sfnm|1a1=Kline|1y=1990|1p=18|2a1=Granata|2y=2003|2p=91}} songs which became staples of his later concerts. That same month, Sinatra and Doris Day released the single "Young at Heart", which reached #2 and was awarded Song of the Year.{{sfnm|1a1=Sinatra|1y=1986|1p=103|2a1=O'Brien|2y=2014}}{{efn|Sinatra was not very enthusiastic about the song initially. His friend, Jimmy Van Heusen, convinced him that the song would be a success.{{sfn|O'Brien|2014}} ''Young at Heart'' was produced by Day's husband at the time, Marty Melcher, whom Sinatra detested. Their feud grew worse when Melcher suggested that Day sing "Young at Heart" as the film's title song when Sinatra's recording of the song was already a hit. Day conceded that she did not care whose voice was heard singing the film's title song. Because of the rift, the ''Young at Heart'' soundtrack album contains all the songs heard in the film but the title ''Young at Heart''. Sinatra's hit recording is heard at the beginning and end of the film.{{sfn|Bret|2014|p=63}}}} In March, he recorded and released the single "Three Coins in the Fountain", a "powerful ballad" that reached #4.{{sfn|Kline|1990|p=19}} Sinatra's second album with Riddle, ''Swing Easy!'', which reflected his "love for the jazz idiom" according to Granata,{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=91}} was released on August 2 of that year and included "Just One of Those Things", "Taking a Chance on Love", "Get Happy", and "All of Me".{{sfn|Kline|1990|p=19}} ''Swing Easy!'' was named Album of the Year by ''Billboard'', and he was also named "Favorite Male Vocalist" by ''Billboard'', ''Down Beat'', and ''Metronome'' that year.{{sfnm|1a1=Sinatra|1y=1986|1p=103|2a1=Evanier|2y=2011|2p=99}} Sinatra came to consider Riddle "the greatest arranger in the world",{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=192}} and Riddle, who considered Sinatra "a perfectionist",{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=191}} offered equal praise of the singer, observing, "It's not only that his intuitions as to tempi, phrasing, and even configuration are amazingly right, but his taste is so impeccable... there is still no one who can approach him."{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=192}}

In 1955 Sinatra released ''In the Wee Small Hours'', his first 12" LP,{{Sfn|Smith|2009|p=18}}  featuring songs such as "In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning", "Mood Indigo", "Glad to Be Unhappy" and "When Your Lover Has Gone". According to Granata it was the first concept album of his to make a "single persuasive statement", with an extended program and "melancholy mood".{{Sfn|Granata|2003|p=91}} Sinatra embarked on his first tour of Australia the same year.{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=302}} Another collaboration with Riddle resulted in the development of ''Songs for Swingin' Lovers!'', sometimes seen as one of his best albums, which was released in March 1956.{{Sfn|Weatherford|2001|p=14}} It features a recording of "I've Got You Under My Skin" by Cole Porter, something which Sinatra paid meticulous care to, taking a reported 22 takes to perfect.{{Sfn|Granata|2003|p=102}}

Look At Me Now" and "From This Moment On" revealed "powerful sexual overtones, stunningly achieved through the mounting tension and release of Sinatra's best-teasing vocal lines", while his recording of "River, Stay 'Way from My Door" in April demonstrated his "brilliance as a syncopational improviser".{{Sfn|Granata|2003|p=98}} Riddle said that Sinatra took "particular delight" in singing "The Lady is a Tramp", commenting that he "always sang that song with a certain amount of salaciousness", making "cue tricks" with the lyrics.{{sfn|Friedwald|1995|p=236}} His penchant for conducting was displayed again in 1956's ''Frank Sinatra Conducts Tone Poems of Color'', an instrumental album that has been interpreted to be a catharsis to his failed relationship with Gardner.{{sfn|Gigliotti|2002|pp=2122}} Also that year, Sinatra sang at the Democratic National Convention, and performed with The Dorsey Brothers for a week soon afterwards at the Paramount Theatre.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=95}}

In 1957, Sinatra released ''Close to You'', ''A Swingin' Affair!'' and ''Where Are You?''his first album in stereo, with Gordon Jenkins.{{sfn|Morrell|2013|p=40}} Granata considers "Close to You" to have been thematically his closest concept album to perfection during the "golden" era, and Nelson Riddle's finest work, which was "extremely progressive" by the stands of the day. It is structured like a three-act play, each commencing with the songs "With Every Breath I Take", "Blame It On My Youth" and  "It Could Happen to You".{{Sfn|Granata|2003|p=121}} For Granata, Sinatra's ''A Swingin' Affair!'' and swing music predecessor ''Songs for Swingin' Lovers!'' solidified "Sinatra's image as a 'swinger', from both a musical and visual standpoint". Buddy Collette considered the swing albums to have been heavily influenced by Sammy Davis, Jr., and stated that when he worked with Sinatra in the mid-1960s he approached a song much differently than he had done in the early 1950s.{{Sfn|Granata|2003|p=102}} On June 9, 1957, he performed in a 62-minute concert conducted by Riddle at the Seattle Civic Auditorium,{{sfn|Levinson|2001|p=138}} his first appearance in Seattle since 1945.''Sinatra '57 in Concert'' (1999), Artanis Entertainment Group.

On May 29 he recorded seven songs in a single session, more than double the usual yield of a recording session, and an eighth was planned, "Lush Life", but Sinatra found it too technically demanding.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=141142}} In September, Sinatra released ''Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely'', a stark collection of introspective{{efn|Granata noted that Riddle himself believed that the album came across as darker and more introspective than normal due to the due of his own mother who had recently died earlier in the month that it was recorded.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=139}}}} saloon songs and blues-tinged ballads which proved a huge commercial success, spending 120 weeks on Billboards album chart and peaking at No.1.{{sfn|Ackelson|1992|p=11}} Cuts from this LP, such as "Angel Eyes" and "One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)", would remain staples of the "saloon song" segments of Sinatra's concerts.

In 1959, Sinatra released ''Come Dance with Me!'', a highly successful, critically acclaimed album which stayed on Billboard's Pop album chart for 140 weeks, peaking at #2. It won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, as well as Best Vocal Performance, Male and Best Arrangement for Billy May.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=143}} He also released ''No One Cares'' in the same year, a collection of "brooding, lonely" torch songs, which critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine thought was "nearly as good as its predecessor ''Where Are You?'', but lacked the "lush" arrangements of it and the "grandiose melancholy" of ''Only the Lonely''.

In the words of Kelley, by 1959, Sinatra was "not simply the leader of the Rat Pack" but had "assumed the position of ''il padrone'' in Hollywood". He was asked by 20th Century Fox to be the master of ceremonies at a luncheon attended by President Nikita Khrushchev on September 19, 1959.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=287288}} ''Nice 'n' Easy'', a collection of ballads, topped the  ''Billboard'' chart in October 1960 and remained in the charts for 86 weeks, {{Sfn|Fuchs|Prigozy|2007|p=101}} winning critical plaudits.{{Sfn|Campbell|2008|p=220}} Granata noted the "lifelike ambient sound" quality of ''Nice and Easy'', the perfection in the stereo balance, and the "bold, bright and snappy" sound of the band.

In 1962, Sinatra released ''Sinatra and Strings'', a set of standard ballads arranged by Don Costa, which became one of the most critically acclaimed works of Sinatra's entire Reprise period. Frank Sinatra, Jr., who was present during the recording, noted the "huge orchestra", which Nancy Sinatra stated "opened a whole new era" in pop music, with orchestras getting bigger, embracing a "lush string sound".{{Sfn|Granata|2003|p=162}} Sinatra and Count Basie collaborated for the album ''Sinatra-Basie'' the same year,{{sfn|Shaw|1982|p=25}} a popular and successful release which prompted them to rejoin two years later for the follow-up ''It Might as Well Be Swing'', arranged by Quincy Jones.{{sfnm|1a1=Sinatra|1y=1986|1p=372|2a1=Granata|2y=2003|2p=169}}  The two became frequent performers together, and appeared at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1965.{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=302}} Also in 1962, as the owner of his own record label, Sinatra was able to step on the podium as conductor again, releasing his third instrumental album ''Frank Sinatra Conducts Music from Pictures and Plays''.{{sfn|Gigliotti|2002|p=22}}

In 1963, Sinatra reunited with Nelson Riddle for ''The Concert Sinatra'', an ambitious album featuring a 73-piece symphony orchestra arranged and conducted by Riddle. The concert was recorded on a motion picture scoring soundstage with the use of multiple synchronized recording machines that employed an optical signal onto 35mm film designed for movie soundtracks. Granata considers the album to have been "impeachable" [sic], "one of the very best of the Sinatra-Riddle ballad albums", in which Sinatra displayed an impressive vocal range, particularly in "Ol' Man River", in which he darkened the hue.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=171173}}  In 1964 the song "My Kind of Town" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Sinatra released ''Softly, as I Leave You'', and collaborated with Bing Crosby and Fred Waring on ''America, I Hear You Singing'', a collection of patriotic songs recorded as a tribute to the assassinated President John F. Kennedy.{{Sfn|Avant-Mier|2010|p=15}} Sinatra increasingly became involved in charitable pursuits in this period.

Sinatra's phenomenal success in 1965, coinciding with his 50th birthday, prompted ''Billboard'' to proclaim that he may have reached the "peak of his eminence". In June 1965, Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Dean Martin played live in St. Louis to benefit Dismas House, a prisoner rehabilitation and training center with nationwide programs that in particular helped serve African Americans. The Rat Pack concert was broadcast live via satellite to numerous movie theaters across America. The album ''September of My Years'' was released September 1965, and went on to win the Grammy Award for best album of the year.{{sfnm|1a1=Sinatra|1y=1986|1p=306|2a1=Jackson|2y=2015|2p=178}} Granata considers the album to have been one of the finest of his Reprise years, "a reflective throwback to the concept records of the 1950s, and more than any of those collections, distills everything that Frank Sinatra had ever learned or experienced as a vocalist".{{Sfn|Granata|2003|p=175}} One of the album's singles, "It Was a Very Good Year", won the Grammy Award for Best Vocal Performance, Male. A career anthology, ''A Man and His Music'', followed in November, winning Album of the Year at the Grammys the following year.

''Strangers in the Night'' went on to top the ''Billboard'' and UK pop singles charts, winning the award for Record of the Year at the Grammys. Sinatra's first live album, ''Sinatra at the Sands'', was recorded during January and February 1966 at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.

Sinatra started 1967 with a series of recording sessions with Antnio Carlos Jobim. He recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Jobim, the Grammy-nominated album ''Francis Albert Sinatra & Antnio Carlos Jobim'', which was one of the best-selling albums of the year, behind the Beatles's ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''. According to Santopietro the album "consists of an extraordinarily effective blend of bossa nova and slightly swinging jazz vocals, and succeeds in creating an unbroken mood of romance and regret".{{Sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=387}} Writer Stan Cornyn wrote that Sinatra sang so softly on the album that it was comparable to the time that he suffered from a vocal hemorrhage in 1950.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=183}} Sinatra also released the album ''The World We Knew'', which features a chart-topping duet of "Somethin' Stupid" with daughter Nancy. In December, Sinatra collaborated with Duke Ellington on the album ''Francis A. & Edward K.''. According to Granata, the recording of "Indian Summer" on the album was a favorite of Riddle's, noting the "contemplative mood [which] is heightened by a Johnny Hodges alto sax solo that will bring a tear to your eye".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=189}} With Sinatra in mind, singer-songwriter Paul Anka wrote the song "My Way", using the melody of the French "Comme d'habitude" ("As Usual"), composed by Claude Franois and Jacques Revaux.{{sfn|Ingham|2005|p=270}} Sinatra recorded it just after Christmas 1968.{{Sfn|Friedwald|1995|p=446}} "My Way", Sinatra's best-known song on the Reprise label, was not an instant success, charting at #27 in the US and #5 in the UK,{{sfn|Kutner|2010|p=296}} but it remained in the UK charts for 122 weeks, including 75 non-consecutive weeks in the Top 40, between April 1969 and September 1971, which was still a record in 2015. Sinatra told songwriter Ervin Drake in the 1970s that he "detested" singing the song, because he believed audiences would think it was a "self-aggrandizing tribute", professing that he "hated boastfulness in others".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=xvii}}

While Sinatra never learned how to read music, he had a fine, natural understanding of it,{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music.{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=31}} He did, however, learn to follow a lead sheet during a performance by "carefully following the patterns and groupings of notes arranged on the page" and made his own notations to the music, using his ear to detect semitonal differences.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=38}} Granata states that some of the most accomplished classically trained musicians soon noticed his musical understanding, and remarked that Sinatra had a "sixth sense", which "demonstrated unusual proficiency when it came to detecting incorrect notes and sounds within the orchestra".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=30}} Sinatra was an aficionado of classical music,{{sfn|Friedwald|1995|p=21}} and would often request classical strains in his music, inspired by composers such as Puccini and Impressionist masters. His personal favorite was Ralph Vaughan Williams.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=93}} He would insist on always recording live with the band because it gave him a "certain feeling" to perform live surrounded by musicians.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=112}} By the mid 1940s, such was his understanding of music that after hearing an air check of some compositions by Alec Wilder which were for strings and woodwinds, he became the conductor at Columbia Records for six of Wilder's compositions:  "Air for Oboe", "Air for English Horn", "Air for Flute", "Air for Bassoon", "Slow Dance" and "Theme and Variations".{{efn|Mitch Miller played English horn and oboe on the Sinatra-led recordings.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}}}} The works, which combine elements of jazz and classical music, were considered by Wilder to have been among the finest renditions and recordings of his compositions, past or present.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} At one recording session with arranger Claus Ogerman and an orchestra, Sinatra heard "a couple of little strangers" in the string section, prompting Ogerman to make corrections to what were thought to be copyist's errors.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} Critic Gene Lees, a lyricist and the author of the words to the Jobim melody "This Happy Madness", expressed amazement when he heard Sinatra's recording of it on ''Sinatra & Company'' (1971), considering him to have delivered the lyrics to perfection.{{sfn|Lees|1998|pp=102103}}

Sinatra could "surpass him by probably as much as four tones at the top".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} Though Riddle stated that Sinatra's lowest was G, he often hit the low F in concerts, and hit the low F at 0:41 in the recording of "What Is This Thing Called Love?" for the 1955 album ''In the Wee Small Hours''.}}  remarking that "His voice has a very strident, insistent sound in the top register, a smooth lyrical sound in the middle register, and a very tender sound in the low. His voice is built on infinite taste, with an overall inflection of sex. He points everything he does from a sexual standpoint".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} Despite his heavy New Jersey accent, according to Richard Schuller, when Sinatra sang his accent was "virtually undetectable", with his diction becoming "precise" and articulation "meticulous".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} His timing was impeccable, allowing him, according to Charles L. Granata, to "toy with the rhythm of a melody, bringing tremendous excitement to his reading of a lyric".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=13}}  Tommy Dorsey observed that Sinatra would "take a musical phrase and play it all the way through seemingly without breathing for eight, ten, maybe sixteen bars." Dorsey was a considerable influence on Sinatra's techniques for his vocal phrasing with his own exceptional breath control on the trombone,{{sfn|Lees|1998|pp=9596}} and Sinatra regularly swam and held his breath underwater, thinking of song lyrics to increase his breathing power.{{sfn|Lahr|2000|pp=5960}}

Arrangers Nelson Riddle and Anthony Fanzo found Sinatra to be a "perfectionist who drove himself and everybody around him relentlessly", and stated that his collaborators approached him with a sense of uneasiness because of his unpredictable and often volatile temperament.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=234}}  Granata comments that Sinatra was almost fanatically obsessed with perfection to the point that people began wondering if he was genuinely concerned about the music or showing off his power over others.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=50}} On days when he felt that his voice was not right, he would know after only a few notes and would postpone the recording session until the following day, yet still pay his musicians.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=105}}  After a period of performing, Sinatra tired of singing a certain set of songs and was always looking for talented new songwriters and composers to work with. Once he found ones that he liked, he actively sought to work with them as often as he could, and made friends with many of them. He once told Sammy Cahn, who wrote songs for ''Anchors Aweigh'', "if you're not there Monday, I'm not there Monday". Over the years he recorded 87 of Cahn's songs, of which 24 were composed by Jule Styne, and 43 by Jimmy Van Heusen. The Cahn-Styne partnership lasted from 1942 until 1954, when Van Heusen succeeded him as Sinatra's main composer.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=1416}} Unlike many of his contemporaries, Sinatra insisted upon direct input regarding arrangements and tempos for his recordings. He would spend weeks thinking about the songs he wanted to record, and would keep an arranger in mind for each song. If it was a mellow love song, he would ask for Gordon Jenkins. If it was a "rhythm" number, he would think of Billy May, or perhaps Neil Hefti or some other favored arranger. Jenkins considered Sinatra's musical sense to be unerring. His changes to Riddle's charts would frustrate Riddle, yet he would usually concede that Sinatra's ideas were superior.{{sfn|Friedwald|1995|pp=2829}} Barbara Sinatra notes that Sinatra would almost always credit the songwriter at the end of each number, and would often make comments to the audience, such as "Isn't that a pretty ballad" or "Don't you think that's the most marvelous love song", delivered with "childlike delight".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=140}} She states that after each show, Sinatra would be "in a buoyant, electrically charged mood, a post-show high that would take him hours to come down from as he quietly relived every note of the performance he'd just given".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=142}}
{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="His voice is more interesting now: he has separated his voice into different colors, in different registers. Years ago, his voice was more even, and now it is divided into at least three interesting ranges: low, middle, and high. [He's] probing more deeply into his songs than he used to. That may be due to the ten years he's put on, and the things he's been through."|source=Nelson Riddle noting the development of Sinatra's voice in 1955.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=137}}}}
Sinatra's split with Gardner in the fall of 1953 had a profound impact on the types of songs he sang and on his voice. He began to console himself in songs with a "brooding melancholy", such as "I'm a Fool to Want You", "Don't Worry 'Bout Me", "My One and Only Love" and There Will Never Be Another You",{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=232}} which Riddle believed was the direct influence of Ava Gardner. Lahr comments that the new Sinatra was "not the gentle boy balladeer of the forties. Fragility had gone from his voice, to be replaced by a virile adult's sense of happiness and hurt".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=69}} Author Granata considered Sinatra a "master of the art of recording", noting that his work in the studio "set him apart from other gifted vocalists". During his career he made over 1000 recordings.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=xiiixvi}} Recording sessions would typically last three hours, though Sinatra would always prepare for them by spending at least an hour by the piano beforehand to vocalize, followed by a short rehearsal with the orchestra to ensure the balance of sound.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=36}} During his Columbia years Sinatra used an RCA 44 microphone, which Granata describes as "the 'old-fashioned' microphone which is closely associated with Sinatra's crooner image of the 1940s", though when performing on talk shows later he used a bullet-shaped RCA 77.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=37}} At Capitol he used a Neumann U47, an "ultra-sensitive" microphone which better captured the timbre and tone of his voice.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=111112}}

In the 1950s, Sinatra's career was facilitated by developments in technology. As disc jockey Jonathan Schwartz said, "Never before had there been an opportunity for a popular singer to express emotions at an extended length". In the words of author John Lahr, "As many as sixteen songs could be held by the twelve-inch L.P., and this allowed Sinatra to use song in a novelistic way, turning each track in a kind of chapter, which built and counterpointed moods to illuminate a larger theme".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|pp=6970}} Santopietro writes that through the 1950s and well into the 1960s, "Every Sinatra LP was a masterpiece of one sort of another, whether uptempo, torch song, or swingin' affairs. Track after track, the brilliant concept albums redefined the nature of pop vocal art".{{Sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=239}}

Sinatra was married to Barbara Marx from 1976 until his death. The couple married on July 11, 1976, at Sunnylands, in Rancho Mirage, California, the estate of media magnate Walter Annenberg.{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|pp=249250}}

Sinatra was close friends with Jilly Rizzo,{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=94}} songwriter Jimmy Van Heusen, golfer Ken Venturi, comedian Pat Henry and baseball manager Leo Durocher.{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=3}} In his spare time, he enjoyed listening to classical music and attended concerts when he could.{{sfn|Friedwald|1995|p=21}} He swam daily in the Pacific Ocean, finding it to be therapeutic and giving him much-needed solitude.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=95}} He often played golf with Venturi at the course in Palm Springs, where he lived,{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=242}} and liked painting, reading, and building model railways.{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=128}}

===Style and personality===

thumb|upright|left|Sinatra in 1955

Sinatra was known for his sense of style.{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=131}} He always dressed immaculately, both in his professional and private life. He felt that as he was the best, he had to give his best to the audience, and wore expensive custom-tailored tuxedos on stage as a sign of respect and to look important.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=51}} He spent lavishly on stylish pin-striped suits and other clothing, and later said that clothing made him feel wealthy and important, bolstering his ego.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=51}} He was also obsessed with cleanlinesswhile with the Tommy Dorsey band he developed the nickname "Lady Macbeth", because of frequent showering and switching his outfits.{{sfn|Levinson|2001|p=116}} His deep blue eyes earned him the popular nickname "Ol' Blue Eyes".{{sfn|Sirvaitis|2010|p=23}}

For Santopietro, Sinatra was the personification of America in the 1950s: "cocky, eye on the main chance, optimistic, and full of the sense of possibility".{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=231}} Barbara Sinatra wrote, "A big part of Frank's thrill was the sense of danger that he exuded, an underlying, ever-present tension only those closest to him knew could be defused with humor".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=3}}  Cary Grant, a friend of Sinatra's, stated that Sinatra was the "most honest person he'd ever met", who spoke "a simple truth, without artifice which scared people", and was often moved to tears by his performances.{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=224}}  Jo-Caroll Dennison commented that he possessed "great inner strength", and that his energy and drive were "enormous".{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=151}} A workaholic, he reportedly only slept four hours a night on average.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=16}} Throughout his life, Sinatra had mood swings and bouts of mild to severe depression,{{sfn|Sinatra|Coplon|2000|p=47}} admitting to an interviewer in the 1950s that "I have an over-acute capacity for sadness as well as elation".{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=218}} Barbara Sinatra stated that he would "snap at anyone for the slightest misdemeanor",{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=148}} while Van Heusen said that when Sinatra got drunk it was "best to disappear".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=155}}

Sinatra's mood swings often developed into violence, directed at people he felt had crossed him, particularly journalists who gave him scathing reviews, publicists, and photographers.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=249250}} According to Rojek he was "capable of deeply offensive behavior that smacked of a persecution complex".{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=141}}  He received negative press for fights with Lee Mortimer in 1947, photographer Eddie Schisser in Houston in 1950, Judy Garland's publicist Jim Byron on the Sunset Strip in 1954,{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=249250}} {{Open access}} and for a confrontation with ''Washington Post'' journalist Maxine Cheshire in 1973, in which he implied that she was a cheap prostitute.{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=141}}{{efn|Rojek states that Sinatra verbally assaulted Cheshire at a party in 1973, remarking, "Get away from me, you scum. Go home and take a bath... You're nothing but a two-dollar cunt. You know what that means, don't you? You've been laying down for two dollars all your life". According to Rojek, Sinatra then proceeded to place two dollar bills in her wine glass and remarked, "Here's two dollars, baby, that's what you're used to".{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=141}}}} In contrast, Sinatra was known for his generosity,{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=146}} particularly after his comeback. Kelley notes that when Lee J. Cobb nearly died from a heart attack in June 1955, Sinatra flooded him with "books, flowers, delicacies", paid his hospital bills, and visited him daily, telling him that his "finest acting" was yet to come.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=251252}} In another instance, after an argument with manager Bobby Burns, rather than apologize, Sinatra bought him a brand new Cadillac.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=53}}

Sinatra became the stereotype of the "tough working-class Italian American", something which he embraced. Sinatra commented that if it had not been for his interest in music he would "probably have ended in a life of crime".{{sfn|McNally|2015|p=50}} In his early days, Mafia boss Willie Moretti, Sinatra's godfather and notorious underboss of the Genovese crime family, helped him for kickbacks and was reported to have intervened in releasing him from his contract with Tommy Dorsey.{{sfn|Sifakis|2005|p=420}} Sinatra was present at the Mafia Havana Conference in 1946,{{sfn|Sifakis|2005|p=419}} and when the press learned of Sinatra's being in Havana with Lucky Luciano, one newspaper published the headline, "Shame, Sinatra".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=63}} He was reported to be a good friend of Sam Giancana,{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=343}} and the two were seen playing golf together.{{sfn|Heymann|2014|p=287}} Kelley quotes Jo-Carrol Silvers in saying that Sinatra "adored" Bugsy Siegel, and boasted to friends about him and how many people he had killed.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=124125}} Kelley claims that Sinatra and mobster Joseph Fischetti had been good friends from 1938 onward, and acted like "Sicilian brothers".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=135}} She also states that Sinatra and Hank Sanicola were financial partners with Mickey Cohen in the gossip magazine ''Hollywood Night Life''.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=176}}

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) kept records amounting to 2,403 pages on Sinatra, who was a natural target with his alleged Mafia ties, his ardent New Deal politics and his friendship with John F. Kennedy. The FBI kept Sinatra under surveillance for almost five decades beginning in the 1940s. The documents include accounts of Sinatra as the target of death threats and extortion schemes. The FBI documented that Sinatra was losing esteem with the Mafia as he grew closer to President Kennedy, whose younger brother Attorney General Robert Kennedy was leading a crackdown on organized crime.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=327329}} Sinatra denied Mafia involvement, declaring, "Any report that I fraternized with goons or racketeers is a vicious lie".{{sfn|McNally|2015|p=49}}

In 1960, Sinatra bought a share in the Cal Neva Lodge & Casino, a casino hotel which straddles the California-Nevada state line on the north shores of Lake Tahoe. Though it only opened between June and September, Sinatra built the Celebrity Room theater, which attracted Sinatra's show business pals Red Skelton, Marilyn Monroe, Victor Borge, Joe E. Lewis, Lucille Ball, Lena Horne, Juliet Prowse, the McGuire Sisters, and others. By 1962 he reportedly held a 50% share in the hotel.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=347348, 355}} Sinatra's gambling license was temporarily stripped by the Nevada Gaming Control Board in 1963 after Giancana was spotted on the premises.{{efn|According to Kelley, Giancana blamed Sinatra for the ordeal and was fuming at the abuse he had given to the commission's chairman, Ed Olsen. The two men never spoke again.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=363364}}}} Due to ongoing pressure from the FBI and Nevada Gaming Commission on mobster control of casinos, Sinatra agreed to give up his share in Cal Neva and the Sands.{{sfn|Waldman|Donovan|1999|p=139}} That year, Sinatra's son, Frank Sinatra, Jr., was kidnapped, but was eventually released unharmed. {{Open access}} Sinatra restored his gaming license in February 1981, following support from Ronald Reagan.{{Sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=408}}

==Politics and activism==
{{main|Political life of Frank Sinatra}}
thumb|upright=1.2|Sinatra, pictured here with Eleanor Roosevelt in 1960, was an ardent supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party until the early 1970s.]]
Sinatra held differing political views throughout his life. His mother, Dolly Sinatra (18961977), was a Democratic Party ward leader.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=16}} Sinatra met President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944, and subsequently heavily campaigned for the Democrats in the 1944 presidential election.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=2005|1p=40|2a1=Summers|2a2=Swan|2y=2010|2p=125}} According to Jo Carroll Silvers, in his younger years Sinatra had "ardent liberal" sympathies, and was "so concerned about poor people that he was always quoting Henry Wallace".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=118, 123}} He was outspoken against racism, particularly toward blacks and Italians, from early on. In November 1945 Sinatra was invited by the mayor of Gary, Indiana, to try to settle a strike by white students of Froebel High School against the "Pro-Negro" policies of the new principal.{{sfn|Ingham|2005|p=26}} His comments, while praised by liberal publications, led to accusations by some that he was a Communist, which he strongly denied.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=122123}} In the 1948 presidential election, Sinatra actively campaigned for President Harry S. Truman. In 1952 and 1956, he also campaigned for Adlai Stevenson.

Of all the U.S. Presidents he associated with during his career, he was closest to John F. Kennedy. Sinatra often invited Kennedy to Hollywood and Las Vegas, and the two would womanize and enjoy parties together.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=298300}} In January 1961 Sinatra and Peter Lawford organized the Inaugural Gala in Washington, D.C., held on the evening before President Kennedy was sworn into office. In 1962, Sinatra was snubbed by Kennedy during his visit to Palm Springs when he decided to stay with the Republican Bing Crosby, due to FBI concerns about Sinatra's alleged connections to organized crime.{{efn|At the time, President Kennedy's brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, was intensifying his own investigations into organized crime figures such as Chicago mob boss Sam Giancana, who had earlier stayed at Sinatra's home. Kennedy was strongly advised by Henry Petersen, a senior official of the Justice Department, to avoid staying with Sinatra.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=334}} }} Sinatra had invested a lot of his own money in upgrading the facilities at his home in anticipation of the President's visit, fitting it with a heliport, which he later reportedly smashed up with a sledgehammer upon being rejected.{{sfn|Thomas|2013|p=169}} Despite the snub, when he learned of Kennedy's assassination he reportedly sobbed in his bedroom for three days.{{efn|When Sinatra learned that Kennedy's killer Lee Harvey Oswald had watched ''Suddenly'' just days before the assassination, he withdrew it from circulation, and it only became distributed again in the late 1980s.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|pp=151152}}}}
thumb|left|upright=1.2|Sinatra is awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Ronald Reagan.
Sinatra worked with Hubert H. Humphrey in 1968, and remained a supporter of the Democratic Party until the early 1970s. Although still a registered Democrat, Sinatra endorsed Republican Ronald Reagan for a second term as Governor of California in 1970.{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|pp=224227}} He officially changed allegiance in July 1972 when he supported Richard Nixon for re-election in the 1972 presidential election.

In the 1980 presidential election, Sinatra supported Ronald Reagan and donated $4million to Reagan's campaign. Sinatra arranged Reagan's Presidential gala, as he had done for Kennedy 20 years previously.{{Sfn|Farris|2013|p=196}} In 1985, Reagan presented Sinatra with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, remarking, "His love of country, his generosity for those less fortunate... make him one of our most remarkable and distinguished Americans."

Santopietro notes that Sinatra was a "lifelong sympathizer with Jewish causes".{{Sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=376}} He was awarded the Hollzer Memorial Award by the Los Angeles Jewish Community in 1949.{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=301}} He gave a series of concerts in Israel in 1962, and donated his entire $50,000 fee for appearing in a cameo role in ''Cast a Giant Shadow'' (1966) to the Youth Center in Jerusalem.{{Sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=376}} On November 1, 1972, he raised $6.5{{nbsp}}million in bond pledges for Israel,{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=231}} and was given the Medallion of Valor for his efforts.{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=307}} The Frank Sinatra Student Center at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem was dedicated in his name in 1978.{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=309}}

From his youth, Sinatra displayed sympathy for African Americans and worked both publicly and privately all his life to help them win equal rights. He blamed racial prejudice on the parents of children.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=138}} Sinatra played a major role in the desegregation of Nevada hotels and casinos in the 1950s and 1960s. At the Sands in 1955, Sinatra went against policy by inviting Nat King Cole into the dining room,{{Sfn|Roman|2011|p=111}} and in 1961, after an incident where an African-American couple entered the lobby of the hotel and were blocked by the security guard, Sinatra and Sammy Davis, Jr. forced the hotel management to begin hiring black waiters and busboys.{{Sfn|Land|Land|2004|p=148}} On January 27, 1961, Sinatra played a benefit show at Carnegie Hall for Martin Luther King, Jr. and led his fellow Rat Pack members and Reprise label mates in boycotting hotels and casinos that refused entry to black patrons and performers. According to his son, Frank Sinatra, Jr., King sat weeping in the audience at one of his father's concerts in 1963 as Sinatra sang "Ol' Man River", a song from the musical ''Show Boat'' that is sung by an African-American stevedore. When he changed his political affiliations in 1970, Sinatra became less outspoken on racial issues.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=544}} Though he did much towards
civil rights causes, it did not stop the occasional racial jibe from him and the other Rat Pack members toward Davis at concerts.{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=133}}

He was further diagnosed as having dementia. He had made no public appearances following a heart attack in February 1997. Sinatra's wife encouraged him to "fight" while attempts were made to stabilize him, and reported that his final words were, "I'm losing." Sinatra's daughter, Tina, later wrote that she and her sister, Nancy, had not been notified of their father's final hospitalization, and it was her belief that "the omission was deliberate. Barbara would be the grieving widow ''alone'' at her husband's side."{{sfn|Sinatra|Coplon|2000|p=286}} The night after Sinatra's death, the lights on the Empire State Building in New York City were turned blue, the lights at the Las Vegas Strip were dimmed in his honor, and the casinos stopped spinning for a minute.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=Introduction xii}}

American music critic Robert Christgau referred to Sinatra as "the greatest singer of the 20th century". His popularity was later matched only by Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Michael Jackson. For Santopietro, Sinatra was the "greatest male pop singer in the history of America",{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=456}} who amassed "unprecedented power onscreen and off", and "seemed to exemplify the common man, an ethnic twentieth-century American male who reached the 'top of the heap', yet never forgot his roots". Santopietro argues that Sinatra created his own world, which he was able to dominatehis career was centred around power, perfecting the ability to capture an audience.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|pp=7678}}

Composer Gus Levene commented that Sinatra's strength was that when it came to lyrics, telling a story musically, Sinatra displayed a "genius" ability and feeling, which with the "rare combination of voice and showmanship" made him the "original singer" which others who followed most tried to emulate.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=68}} George Roberts, a trombonist in Sinatra's band, remarked that Sinatra had a "charisma, or whatever it is about him, that no one else had".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=32}} Biographer Arnold Shaw considered that "If Las Vegas had not existed, Sinatra could have invented it". He quoted reporter James Bacon in saying that Sinatra was the "swinging image on which the town is built", adding that no other entertainer quite "embodied the glamour" associated with Las Vegas as him.{{sfn|Shaw|1982|p=48}} Sinatra continues to be seen as one of the icons of the 20th century,{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=1}}
