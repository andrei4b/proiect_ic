In the UK, the dance-funk "Someone for Me", which failed to chart in the country, was the first single while "All at Once" was in such European countries as the Netherlands and Belgium, where the song reached the top 5 on the singles charts, respectively.{{vcite book|title=Whitney Houston's Success Is Global|work=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8yQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT54|accessdate=February 13, 2012|date=June 8, 1985|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=54|issn=0006-2510}}

In the US, the soulful ballad "You Give Good Love" was chosen as the lead single from Houston's debut to establish her in the black marketplace first.{{vcite news | first = Paul| last = Grein | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-08/entertainment/ca-9249_1/3 | title = Houston Hits: Master Plan, Blind Luck | publisher = Tribune Company |work=Los Angeles Times | date = June 8, 1986 | accessdate =October 28, 2011}} Outside the US, the song failed to get enough attention to become a hit, but in the US, it gave the album its first major hit as it peaked at No. 3 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, and No. 1 on the Hot R&B chart. As a result, the album began to sell strongly, and Houston continued promotion by touring nightclubs in the US. She also began performing on late-night television talk shows, which were not usually accessible to unestablished black acts. The jazzy ballad "Saving All My Love for You" was released next and it would become Houston's first No. 1 single in both the US and the UK. She was then an opening act for singer Jeffrey Osborne on his nationwide tour. "Thinking About You" was released as the promo single only to R&B-oriented radio stations, which peaked at number ten on the US R&B Chart. At the time, MTV had received harsh criticism for not playing enough videos by black, Latino, and other racial minorities while favoring white acts.{{vcite episode|title=Whitney Houston |series=Headliners And Legends |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036702/ |airdate=August 11, 2000 |season= |number= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021140553/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036702 |archivedate=October 21, 2009 }} The third US single, "How Will I Know", peaked at No. 1, and the video introduced Houston to the MTV audience. Houston's subsequent singles from this, and future albums, would make her the first African-American woman to receive consistent heavy rotation on MTV.

With many expectations, Houston's second album, ''Whitney'', was released in June 1987. The album again featured production from Masser, Kashif and Walden as well as Jellybean Benitez.

In 1989, Houston formed The Whitney Houston Foundation For Children, a non-profit organization that has raised funds for the needs of children around the world. The organization cares for homelessness, children with cancer or AIDS, and other issues of self-empowerment. 

With the success of her first two albums, Houston was undoubtedly an international crossover superstar, the most prominent since Michael Jackson, appealing to all demographics. However, some black critics believed she was "selling out". They felt her singing on record lacked the soul that was present during her live concerts. At the 1989 Soul Train Music Awards, when Houston's name was called out for a nomination, a few in the audience jeered.{{vcite book|author=Johnson Publishing Company|title=Ebony|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA112|date=May 1991|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|page=112|issn=0012-9011}}Ralph M.

I'm not ashamed of it." 

Houston took a more urban direction with her third studio album, ''I'm Your Baby Tonight'', released in November 1990. She produced and chose producers for this album and as a result, it featured production and collaborations with L.A. Reid and Babyface, Luther Vandross, and Stevie Wonder. The album showed Houston's versatility on a new batch of tough rhythmic grooves, soulful ballads and up-tempo dance tracks. Reviews were mixed.

The album contained several hits: the first two singles, "I'm Your Baby Tonight" and "All the Man That I Need" peaked at number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart; "Miracle" peaked at number nine; "My Name Is Not Susan" peaked in the top twenty; "I Belong to You" reached the top ten of the US R&B chart and garnered Houston a Grammy nomination; and the sixth single, the Stevie Wonder duet "We Didn't Know", reached the R&B top twenty.

Throughout the 1980s, Houston was romantically linked to American football star Randall Cunningham and actor Eddie Murphy. She then met R&B singer Bobby Brown at the 1989 Soul Train Music Awards. After a three-year courtship, the two were married on July 18, 1992. On March 4, 1993, Houston gave birth to their daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown (March 4, 1993  July 26, 2015), the couple's only child.

===19951997: ''Waiting to Exhale'', ''The Preacher's Wife'', and ''Cinderella''===
In 1995, Houston starred alongside Angela Bassett, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon in her second film, ''Waiting to Exhale'', a motion picture about four African-American women struggling with relationships. Houston played the lead character Savannah Jackson, a TV producer in love with a married man. She chose the role because she saw the film as "a breakthrough for the image of black women because it presents them both as professionals and as caring mothers". After opening at number one and grossing $67 million in the US at the box office and $81 million worldwide, it proved that a movie primarily targeting a black audience can cross over to success, while paving the way for other all-black movies such as ''How Stella Got Her Groove Back'' and the Tyler Perry movies that became popular in the 2000s. The film is also notable for its portrayal of black women as strong middle class citizens rather than as stereotypes. The reviews were mainly positive for the ensemble cast. ''The New York Times'' said: "Ms. Houston has shed the defensive hauteur that made her portrayal of a pop star in 'The Bodyguard' seem so distant." Houston was nominated for an NAACP Image Award for "Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture", but lost to her co-star Bassett.

The film's accompanying soundtrack, ''Waiting to Exhale: Original Soundtrack Album'', was written and produced by Babyface. Though he originally wanted Houston to record the entire album, she declined. Instead, she "wanted it to be an album of women with vocal distinction", and thus gathered several African-American female artists for the soundtrack, to go along with the film's message about strong women. Consequently, the album featured a range of contemporary R&B female recording artists along with Houston, such as Mary J. Blige, Brandy, Toni Braxton, Aretha Franklin, and Patti LaBelle. Houston's "Exhale (Shoop Shoop)" peaked at No. 1, and then spent a record eleven weeks at the No. 2 spot and eight weeks on top of the R&B Charts. "Count On Me", a duet with CeCe Winans, hit the U.S. Top 10; and Houston's third contribution, "Why Does It Hurt So Bad", made the Top 30. The album debuted at No. 1, and was certified 7 Platinum in the United States, denoting shipments of seven million copies. The soundtrack received strong reviews; as ''Entertainment Weekly'' stated: "the album goes down easy, just as you'd expect from a package framed by Whitney Houston tracks... the soundtrack waits to exhale, hovering in sensuous suspense"''Entertainment Weekly (December 1, 1995), page=73 and has since ranked it as one of the 100 Best Movie Soundtracks. Later that year, Houston's children's charity organization was awarded a VH1 Honor for all the charitable work.

In 1996, Houston starred in the holiday comedy ''The Preacher's Wife'', with Denzel Washington. She plays a gospel-singing wife of a pastor (Courtney B. Vance). It was largely an updated remake of the 1948 film ''The Bishop's Wife'', which starred Loretta Young, David Niven and Cary Grant. Houston earned $10 million for the role, making her one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood at the time and the highest-earning African-American actress in Hollywood. The movie, with its all African-American cast, was a moderate success, earning approximately $50 million at the U.S. box offices. The movie gave Houston her strongest reviews so far. ''The San Francisco Chronicle'' said Houston "is rather angelic herself, displaying a divine talent for being virtuous and flirtatious at the same time", and she "exudes gentle yet spirited warmth, especially when praising the Lord in her gorgeous singing voice". Houston was again nominated for an NAACP Image Award and won for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture.

Houston recorded and co-produced, with Mervyn Warren, the film's accompanying gospel soundtrack. ''The Preacher's Wife: Original Soundtrack Album'' included six gospel songs with Georgia Mass Choir that were recorded at the Great Star Rising Baptist Church in Atlanta. Houston also duetted with gospel legend Shirley Caesar. The album sold six million copies worldwide and scored hit singles with "I Believe in You and Me" and "Step by Step", becoming the largest selling gospel album of all time. The album received mainly positive reviews. Some critics, such as that of ''USA Today'', noted the presence of her emotional depth, while ''The Times'' said, "To hear Houston going at full throttle with the 35 piece Georgia Mass Choir struggling to keep up is to realise what her phenomenal voice was made for". She won Favorite Adult Contemporary Artist at the 1997 American Music Awards for ''The Preacher's Wife'' soundtrack.

In December 1996, Whitney's spokesperson confirmed that she had had a miscarriage. 

In 1997, Houston's production company changed its name to BrownHouse Productions and was joined by Debra Martin Chase. Their goal was "to show aspects of the lives of African-Americans that have not been brought to the screen before" while improving how African-Americans are portrayed in film and television. Their first project was a made-for-television remake of Rodgers & Hammerstein's ''Cinderella''. In addition to co-producing, Houston starred in the movie as the Fairy Godmother along with Brandy, Jason Alexander, Whoopi Goldberg, and Bernadette Peters. Houston was initially offered the role of Cinderella in 1993, but other projects intervened. The film is notable for its multi-racial cast and nonstereotypical message. An estimated 60 million viewers tuned into the special giving ABC its highest TV ratings in 16 years. The movie received seven Emmy nominations including Outstanding Variety, Musical or Comedy, while winning Outstanding Art Direction in a Variety, Musical or Comedy Special.

Houston and Chase then obtained the rights to the story of Dorothy Dandridge. Houston was to play Dandridge, the first African American actress to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Houston wanted the story told with dignity and honor. However, Halle Berry also had rights to the project and got her version going first. Later that year, Houston paid tribute to her idols, such as Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross, and Dionne Warwick, by performing their hits during the three-night HBO Concert ''Classic Whitney: Live from Washington, D.C.''. The special raised over $300,000 for the Children's Defense Fund. Houston received the Quincy Jones Award for outstanding career achievements in the field of entertainment at the 12th Soul Train Music Awards.{{vcite web | url = http://www.soultrain.com/stma/library.html | title = Soul Train Music Awards Library: 1998 The 12th Soul Train Music Awards | publisher = Don Cornelius Productions, Inc | date = February 27, 1998 | accessdate =June 30, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725073904/http://www.soultrain.com/stma/library.html |archivedate=July 25, 2013}}

Though originally slated to be a greatest hits album with a handful of new songs, recording sessions were so fruitful that a new full-length studio album was released. Recorded and mixed in only six weeks, it featured production from Rodney Jerkins, Wyclef Jean and Missy Elliott.

===20002005: ''Just Whitney'' and personal struggles===
Though Houston was seen as a "good girl" with a perfect image in the 1980s and early 1990s, her behavior had changed by the late 1990s. She was often hours late for interviews, photo shoots and rehearsals, and she canceled concerts and talk-show appearances.{{vcite news |title=Whitney Houston biography |work=Rolling Stone |year=2012 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/whitney-houston/biography |accessdate=February 12, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209024845/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/whitneyhouston/biography |archivedate=December 9, 2009}}Larry McShane, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/digest/ent3.htm "Whitney Houston Gets Bad Press"], ''The Washington Post'', April 6, 2000. Missed performances and weight loss led to rumors about Houston using drugs with her husband. On January 11, 2000, airport security guards discovered marijuana in both Houston's and husband Bobby Brown's luggage at a Hawaii airport, but the two boarded the plane and departed before authorities could arrive. Charges were later dropped against them, but rumors of drug usage by Houston and Brown would continue to surface. Two months later, Clive Davis was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Houston had been scheduled to perform at the event, but failed to show up.

Shortly thereafter, Houston was scheduled to perform at the Academy Awards, but was fired from the event by musical director and longtime friend Burt Bacharach. Her publicist cited throat problems as the reason for the cancellation. In his book ''The Big Show: High Times and Dirty Dealings Backstage at the Academy Awards'', author Steve Pond revealed that "Houston's voice was shaky, she seemed distracted and jittery, and her attitude was casual, almost defiant", and that while Houston was supposed to sing "Over the Rainbow", she would start singing a different song during rehearsals.Movie & TV News @ IMDb.com, [http://www.imdb.com/news/wenn/2004-12-23#celeb5 "Houston's Oscar Confusion"], December 23, 2004.

Later that year, Houston's long-time executive assistant and friend, Robyn Crawford, resigned from Houston's management company.

In August 2001, Houston signed one of the biggest record deals in music history, with Arista/BMG. She renewed her contract for $100 million to deliver six new albums, on which she would also earn royalties.{{vcite news |first=Robert |last=Lafranco |last2=Binelli |first2=Mark |last3=Goodman |first3=Fred |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938443/the_rolling_stone_money_report |title=The Rolling Stone Money Report: The pop stars who earned the most last year and how they did it |publisher=Wenner Media, LLC |date=July 4, 2002 |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}{{vcite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BbUDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA18 |title=Whitney Houston Signs $100 Million Contract with Arista Records (p18) |work=Jet |date=August 20, 2001 |accessdate=January 12, 2010}}{{vcite journal |journal=Billboard |first=Gail |last=Mitchell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQ0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA1|title=Arista Aims New Houston Album At 'Core Urban' Fans |publisher=Nielson Business Media, Inc. |date=December 14, 2002 |accessdate=January 12, 2010}} She later made an appearance on ''Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special'', where her extremely thin frame further spurred rumors of drug use.

In 2002, Houston became involved in a legal dispute with John Houston Enterprise. Although the company was started by her father to manage her career, it was actually run by company president Kevin Skinner. Skinner filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit and sued for $100 million (but lost), stating that Houston owed the company previously unpaid compensation for helping to negotiate her $100 million contract with Arista Records and for sorting out legal matters.{{vcite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458015/20021008/houston_whitney.jhtml?headlines=true |title=Whitney Houston Sued For $100 Million By Dad's Company |accessdate=January 15, 2008 |publisher=MTV |date=October 8, 2002}} Houston stated that her 81-year-old father had nothing to do with the lawsuit.

Also in 2002, Houston did an interview with Diane Sawyer to promote her then-upcoming album. During the prime-time special, Houston spoke about her drug use and her marriage, among other topics. Asked about the ongoing drug rumors, she replied, "First of all, let's get one thing straight. Crack is cheap. I make too much money to ever smoke crack. Let's get that straight. Okay? We don't do crack. We don't do that. Crack is wack." The "crack is wack" line was drawn from a mural that Keith Haring painted in 1986 on the handball court at 128th Street and Second Avenue in Manhattan.{{vcite web|last=Haring|first=Keith|title=Crack is Wack|url=http://www.haring.com/!/art-work/108#.U4zvQeaSys1|publisher = Crack is Wack Mural}} Houston did, however, admit to using alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, and pills; she also acknowledged that her mother had urged her to seek help regarding her drug use. Houston also denied having an eating disorder, and denied that her very thin appearance was connected to drug use. Houston further stated that Bobby Brown had never hit her, but acknowledged that she had hit him. 

In December 2002, Houston released her fifth studio album, ''Just Whitney''. The album included productions from then-husband Bobby Brown, as well as Missy Elliott and Babyface, and marked the first time that Houston did not produce with Clive Davis as Davis had been released by top management at BMG. Upon its release, ''Just Whitney'' received mixed reviews.MetaCritic.com, [http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/houstonwhitney/justwhitney "Just Whitney" by Whitney Houston] (last visited February 15, 2008).

In late 2003, Houston released her first Christmas album ''One Wish: The Holiday Album'', with a collection of traditional holiday songs. Houston produced the album with Mervyn Warren and Gordon Chambers. A single titled "One Wish (for Christmas)" reached the Top 20 on the Adult Contemporary chart, and the album was certified gold in the US. 

In December 2003, Bobby Brown was charged with battery following a domestic altercation in which he allegedly threatened to beat Houston and then hit her in the face.

Having always been a touring artist, Houston spent most of 2004 touring and performing in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Russia. In September 2004, she gave a surprise performance at the World Music Awards in a tribute to long-time friend Clive Davis. After the show, Davis and Houston announced plans to go into the studio to work on her new album.

In early 2004, husband Bobby Brown starred in his own reality TV program, ''Being Bobby Brown'', on the Bravo network. The show provided a view of the domestic goings-on in the Brown household. Though it was Brown's vehicle, Houston was a prominent figure throughout the show, receiving as much screen time as Brown. The series aired in 2005 and featured Houston in unflattering moments. ''The Hollywood Reporter'' said that the show was "undoubtedly the most disgusting and execrable series ever to ooze its way onto television".Barry Garron, [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8409211/ "'Being Bobby Brown' Is Disgusting"], MSNBC, July 7, 2005.

Houston also acknowledged to Oprah that her drug use had continued after rehabilitation, and that at one point, her mother obtained a court order and the assistance of law enforcement to press her into receiving further drug treatment. In her 2013 book, ''Remembering Whitney: My Story of Love, Loss, and the Night the Music Stopped'', Cissy Houston described the scene she encountered at Whitney Houstons house in 2005 as follows: Somebody had spray-painted the walls and door with big glaring eyes and strange faces. Evil eyes, staring out like a threat... In another room there was a big framed photo of [Whitney]  but someone had cut [her] head out. It was beyond disturbing, seeing my daughters face cut out like that. This visit led Cissy to return with law enforcement and perform an intervention.

Ehrlich went on to say: "It's too fresh in everyone's memory to do more at this time, but we would be remiss if we didn't recognize Whitney's remarkable contribution to music fans in general, and in particular her close ties with the Grammy telecast and her Grammy wins and nominations over the years."{{vcite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/02/11/whitney-houston-dies-at-48/|title=Singer Whitney Houston found dead|publisher=FoxNews|date=February 12, 2012|accessdate=February 12, 2012}} At the start of the awards ceremony, footage of Houston performing "I Will Always Love You" from the 1994 Grammys was shown following a prayer read by host LL Cool J.

Lauren Everitt from BBC News Magazine commented on melisma used in Houston's recording and its influence. "An early 'I' in Whitney Houston's 'I Will Always Love You' takes nearly six seconds to sing. In those seconds the former gospel singer-turned-pop star packs a series of different notes into the single syllable", stated Everitt. "The technique is repeated throughout the song, most pronouncedly on every 'I' and 'you'. The vocal technique is called melisma, and it has inspired a host of imitators. Other artists may have used it before Houston, but it was her rendition of Dolly Parton's love song that pushed the technique into the mainstream in the 90s. [...] But perhaps what Houston nailed best was moderation." Everitt said that "[i]n a climate of reality shows ripe with 'oversinging,' it's easy to appreciate Houston's ability to save melisma for just the right moment."{{vcite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17039208 | title = Whitney Houston and the art of melisma | first = Lauren | last = Everitt | publisher = BBC | date = February 15, 2012 | accessdate = February 20, 2012}}

Houston's vocal stylings have had a significant impact on the music industry. According to Linda Lister in ''Divafication: The Deification of Modern Female Pop Stars'', she has been called the "Queen of Pop" for her influence during the 1990s, commercially rivaling Mariah Carey and Celine Dion."If Ella Fitzgerald is the queen of jazz, Billie Holiday first lady of the blues, and Aretha Franklin the queen of soul, then who is the queen of pop? In the 1990s, it would seem to be a three-way tie between Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, and Celine Dion. Certainly all three have their devotees and detractors, but their presence has been inescapable." in {{vcite news | last1= Lister | first1=Linda | title=Divafication: The Deification of Modern Female Pop Stars| newspaper= Popular Music and Society | volume=25|issue=3/4| page=1| year= 2001|issn=0300-7766 | postscript= }} Stephen Holden from ''The New York Times'', in his review of Houston's Radio City Music Hall concert on July 20, 1993, praised her attitude as a singer, writing, "Whitney Houston is one of the few contemporary pop stars of whom it might be said: the voice suffices. While almost every performer whose albums sell in the millions calls upon an entertainer's bag of tricks, from telling jokes to dancing to circus pyrotechnics, Ms. Houston would rather just stand there and sing." With regard to her singing style, he added: "Her [Houston's] stylistic trademarks shivery melismas that ripple up in the middle of a song, twirling embellishments at the ends of phrases that suggest an almost breathless exhilaration infuse her interpretations with flashes of musical and emotional lightning."{{vcite news | author = Holden, Stephen | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/22/arts/review-pop-for-whitney-houston-showy-doesn-t-count-the-show-is-the-voice.html | title = Review/Pop; For Whitney Houston, Showy Doesn't Count: The Show Is the Voice |work=The New York Times | date = July 22, 1993 | accessdate =March 13, 2011 | authorlink = Stephen Holden}}

Houston struggled with vocal challenges during her later years. Gary Catona, a voice coach who began working with Houston in 2005, stated: "'When I first started working with her in 2005, she had lost 99.9 percent of her voice... She could barely speak, let alone sing. Her lifestyle choices had made her almost completely hoarse.'" After Houston's death, Catona said that Houston's voice had been damaged by her "extra-curricular activities"; Catona said, "The vocal mechanism is made up of skin tissue and muscle. It doesn't do well when it's abused by smoke... and other substances."

===Influence===
During the 1980s, MTV was coming into its own and received criticism for not playing enough videos by black artists. With Michael Jackson breaking down the color barrier for black men, Houston did the same for black women. She became the first black woman to receive heavy rotation on the network following the success of the "How Will I Know" video."Whitney Houston". ''Headliners and Legends''. NBC. August 8, 2000. Following Houston's breakthrough, other African-American women, such as Janet Jackson and Anita Baker, were successful in popular music. Baker commented that "Because of what Whitney and Sade did, there was an opening for me... For radio stations, black women singers aren't taboo anymore."{{vcite news | first = Dennis |last=Hunt | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-18/entertainment/ca-5281_1_other-black-women | title = Baker And The Rise Of Black Women In Pop | publisher = Tribune Company |work=Los Angeles Times | date = January 18, 1987 | accessdate =March 26, 2011}}

AllMusic noted her contribution to the success of black artists on the pop scene, commenting, "Houston was able to handle big adult contemporary ballads, effervescent, stylish dance-pop, and slick urban contemporary soul with equal dexterity" and that "the result was an across-the-board appeal that was matched by scant few artists of her era, and helped her become one of the first black artists to find success on MTV in Michael Jackson's wake".{{vcite web | first = Steve |last=Huey | url = http://www.allmusic.com/artist/whitney-houston-p4519/biography | title = Whitney Houston Biography | publisher = AllMusic | accessdate =October 16, 2010}} ''The New York Times'' stated that "Houston was a major catalyst for a movement within black music that recognized the continuity of soul, pop, jazz and gospel vocal traditions".Holden, Stephen. "The Pop Life; 1986, A Musically Conservative Year". ''The New York Times''. December 31, 1986. Richard Corliss of ''Time'' magazine commented on her initial success breaking various barriers:Of her first album's ten cuts, six were ballads. This chanteuse [Houston] had to fight for air play with hard rockers. The young lady had to stand uncowed in the locker room of macho rock. The soul strutter had to seduce a music audience that anointed few black artists with superstardom. [...] She was a phenomenon waiting to happen, a canny tapping of the listener's yen for a return to the musical middle. And because every new star creates her own genre, her success has helped other blacks, other women, other smooth singers find an avid reception in the pop marketplace.{{vcite news | author = Corliss, Richard, Elizabeth L.

Stephen Holden of ''The New York Times'' said that Houston "revitalized the tradition of strong gospel-oriented pop-soul singing".Holden, Stephen. [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/16/arts/review-pop-diana-ross-flirts-with-a-willing-audience.html "Review/Pop; Diana Ross Flirts With a Willing Audience"]. ''The New York Times''. June 16, 1989. Ann Powers of the ''Los Angeles Times'' referred to the singer as a "national treasure". Jon Caramanica, another music critic of ''The New York Times'', called Houston "R&B's great modernizer", adding "slowly but surely reconciling the ambition and praise of the church with the movements and needs of the body and the glow of the mainstream". He also drew comparisons between Houston's influence and other big names' on 1980s pop:She was, alongside Michael Jackson and Madonna, one of the crucial figures to hybridize pop in the 1980s, though her strategy was far less radical than that of her peers. Jackson and Madonna were by turns lascivious and brutish and, crucially, willing to let their production speak more loudly than their voices, an option Ms. Houston never went for. Also, she was less prolific than either of them, achieving most of her renown on the strength of her first three solo albums and one soundtrack, released from 1985 to 1992. If she was less influential than they were in the years since, it was only because her gift was so rare, so impossible to mimic. Jackson and Madonna built worldviews around their voices; Ms. Houstons voice was the worldview. She was someone more to be admired, like a museum piece, than to be emulated.

''The Independent''{{'}}s music critic Andy Gill also wrote about Houston's influence on modern R&B and singing competitions, comparing it to Michael Jackson's. "Because Whitney, more than any other single artist  Michael Jackson included  effectively mapped out the course of modern R&B, setting the bar for standards of soul vocalese, and creating the original template for what we now routinely refer to as the 'soul diva' ", stated Gill. "Jackson was a hugely talented icon, certainly, but he will be as well remembered (probably more so) for his presentational skills, his dazzling dance moves, as for his musical innovations. Whitney, on the other hand, just sang, and the ripples from her voice continue to dominate the pop landscape." Gill said that there "are few, if any, Jackson imitators on today's TV talent shows, but every other contestant is a Whitney wannabe, desperately attempting to emulate that wondrous combination of vocal effects the flowing melisma, the soaring mezzo-soprano confidence, the tremulous fluttering that carried the ends of lines into realms of higher yearning".{{vcite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/whitney-houston-the-greatest-voice-of-her-generation-6988653.html | title = Whitney Houston, the greatest voice of her generation | work = The Independent | publisher = Independent Print Ltd.| first = Any | last = Gill | date = February 17, 2012 | accessdate = February 20, 2012}}

On 27 April 2016, it was announced that Macdonald would work with the film production team Altitude, who are behind the award-winning & controversially acclaimed Amy Winehouse film ''Amy'' (2015), on a new documentary film based on Houston's life and death. This is the first documentary to be officially authorized by the estate that will tell the unvarnished and authentic story of the singers life in a film, including access to never-before-seen footage of Houston, exclusive demo recordings, rare performances and audio archive. Macdonald also will interview those who knew her best, including Clive Davis, founder and president of Arista Records. Macdonald stated; "The story that is never told about Whitney is just how brilliant she was as an artist; by many measures she had the greatest voice of the last 50 years. She changed the way pop music was sung - bringing it back full circle to its blues and gospel roots. She was also completely unique in being a black pop star who transcended her race globally with her work sold in countries where black artists dont sell." The film, entitled ''Whitney'' is set to premiere at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival and is scheduled to released internationally in theatres on July 6, 2018.https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/films/941774/Whitney-Houston-film-trailer-release-date-Biopic-home-videos-died-drugs
