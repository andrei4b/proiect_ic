'''Adele Laurie Blue Adkins''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|MBE}} ({{IPAc-en|||d||l}}; born 5 May 1988) is an English singer and songwriter. After graduating from the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology in 2006, Adele was given a recording contract by XL Recordings after a friend posted her demo on Myspace the same year. In 2007, she received the Brit Awards "Critics' Choice" award and won the BBC Sound of 2008 poll. Her debut album, ''19'', was released in 2008 to commercial and critical success. It is certified seven times platinum in the UK, and three times platinum in the US. The album contains her first song, "Hometown Glory", written when she was 16, which is based on her home suburb of West Norwood in London. An appearance she made on ''Saturday Night Live'' in late 2008 boosted her career in the US. At the 51st Grammy Awards in 2009, Adele received the awards for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.

Adele released her second studio album, ''21'', in 2011. The album was critically well received and surpassed the success of her debut, earning numerous awards in 2012, among them a record-tying six Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year; two Brit Awards, including British Album of the Year; and three American Music Awards. The album has been certified 16 times platinum in the UK, and is overall the fourth best-selling album in the nation. In the US, it has held the top position longer than any album since 1985, and is certified diamond. The best-selling album worldwide of 2011 and 2012, ''21'' has sold over 31 million copies. The success of ''21'' earned Adele numerous mentions in the ''Guinness Book of World Records.'' She was the first female artist to simultaneously have two albums in the top five of the ''Billboard'' 200 and two singles in the top five of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 as well as the first woman in the history of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 to have three simultaneous top 10 singles as a lead artist with "Rolling in the Deep", "Someone Like You", and "Set Fire to the Rain", all of which also topped the chart. ''21'' is the longest-running number one album by a female solo artist in the history of the UK and US Album Charts.

In 2012, Adele released "Skyfall", which she co-wrote and recorded for the James Bond film of the same name. The song won an Academy Award, a Grammy Award, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, as well as the Brit Award for British Single of the Year. After taking a three-year break, Adele released her third studio album, ''25'', in 2015. It became the year's best-selling album and broke first-week sales records in the UK and US. ''25'' was her second album to be certified diamond in the US and earned her five Grammy Awards, including her second Grammy Award for Album of the Year, and four Brit Awards. The lead single, "Hello", became the first song in the US to sell over one million digital copies within a week of its release. Her third concert tour, Adele Live 2016, visited Europe, North America and Oceania, and concluded with finale concerts at Wembley Stadium in late June 2017.

In 2011, 2012, and 2016, Adele was named Artist of the Year by ''Billboard''. At the 2012 and 2016 Ivor Novello Awards, Adele was named Songwriter of the Year by the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.

== Life and career ==

=== 19882006: Childhood ===
Adele Laurie Blue Adkins was born on 5 May 1988 in Tottenham, London, to an English mother, Penny Adkins, and a Welsh father, Marc Evans. Evans left when Adele was two, leaving her mother to raise her. She began singing at age four and asserts that she became obsessed with voices. Growing up, Adele spent most of her time singing rather than reading; the last book she read was Roald Dahl's ''Matilda'' when she was six years old. In 1997, at the age of nine, Adele and her mother, who by then had found work as a furniture maker and an adult-learning activities organiser, relocated to Brighton on the south coast of England.

In 1999 she and her mother moved back to London; first to Brixton, then to the neighbouring district of West Norwood in south London.
Adele graduated from the BRIT School for Performing Arts & Technology in Croydon in May 2006, where she was a classmate of Leona Lewis and Jessie J.Collis, Clark (19 December 2008), "Spotlight on... Adele." ''Entertainment Weekly.'' (1026):62. Adele credits the school with nurturing her talent even though, at the time, she was more interested in going into A&R and hoped to launch other people's careers.

=== 20062010: Beginnings and ''19'' ===

Four months after graduation, she published two songs on the fourth issue of the online arts publication ''PlatformsMagazine.com.'' She had recorded a three-song demo for a class project and given it to a friend. The friend posted the demo on Myspace, where it became very successful and led to a phone call from Richard Russell, boss of the music label XL Recordings. She doubted if the offer was real because the only record company she knew was Virgin Records, and she took a friend with her to the meeting.

Nick Huggett, at XL, recommended Adele to manager Jonathan Dickins at September Management, and in June 2006, Dickins became her official representative. September was managing Jamie T at the time and this proved a major draw for Adele, a big fan of the British singer-songwriter. Huggett then signed Adele to XL in September 2006. Adele provided vocals for Jack Peate's song, "My Yvonne," for his debut album, and it was during this session she first met producer Jim Abbiss, who would go on to produce both the majority of her debut album, ''19,'' and tracks on ''21.'' In June 2007, Adele made her television debut, performing "Daydreamer" on the BBC's ''Later... with Jools Holland''. Adele's breakthrough song, "Hometown Glory", was released in October 2007.

By 2008, Adele had become the headliner and performed an acoustic set, in which she was supported by Damien Rice.{{dead link|date=August 2011}} She became the first recipient of the Brit Awards ''Critics' Choice'' and was named the number-one predicted breakthrough act of 2008 in an annual BBC poll of music critics, Sound of 2008. The album ''19,'' named for her age at the time she wrote and composed many of its songs, entered the British charts at number one. ''The Times'' ''Encyclopedia of Modern Music'' named ''19'' an "essential" blue-eyed soul recording. She released her second single, "Chasing Pavements", on 14 January 2008, two weeks ahead of her debut album, ''19''. The song reached number two on the UK Chart, and stayed there for four weeks. Adele was nominated for a 2008 Mercury Prize award for ''19''. She also won an Urban Music Award for "Best Jazz Act." She also received a Q Awards nomination in the category of Breakthrough Act and a Music of Black Origin nomination in the category of Best UK Female. In March 2008, Adele signed a deal with Columbia Records and XL Recordings for her foray into the United States. She embarked on a short North American tour in the same month, and ''19'' was released in the US in June. ''Billboard'' magazine stated of it: "Adele truly has potential to become among the most respected and inspiring international artists of her generation." The An Evening with Adele world tour began in May 2008 and ended in June 2009.

She later cancelled the 2008 US tour dates to be with a former boyfriend. She said in ''Nylon'' magazine in June 2009, "I'm like, 'I can't believe I did that.' It seems so ungrateful.... I was drinking far too much and that was kind of the basis of my relationship with this boy. I couldn't bear to be without him, so I was like, 'Well, I'll just cancel my stuff then.'"Shapiro, Marc (2012). "Adele: The Biography". p. 88. Macmillan. She referred to this period as her "early life crisis". She is also known for her dislike of flying and bouts of homesickness when away from her native London. By the middle of October 2008, Adele's attempt to break in America appeared to have failed.{{dead link|date=August 2011}} But then she was booked as the musical guest on 18 October 2008 episode of NBC's ''Saturday Night Live.'' The episode, which included an expected appearance by then US vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, earned the program its best ratings in 14 years with 17million viewers. Adele performed "Chasing Pavements" and "Cold Shoulder," and the following day, ''19'' topped the iTunes charts and ranked at number five at Amazon.com while "Chasing Pavements" rose into the top 25. The album reached number 11 on the ''Billboard'' 200 as a result, a jump of 35 places over the previous week.
In November 2008 Adele moved to Notting Hill, London after leaving her mother's house, a move that prompted her to give up drinking. The album was certified gold in February 2009 by the RIAA. By July 2009, the album had sold 2.2million copies worldwide.

At the 51st Annual Grammy Awards in February 2009, Adele received the award for Best New Artist, in addition to the award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for "Chasing Pavements", which was also nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. Adele performed "Chasing Pavements" at the ceremony in a duet with Jennifer Nettles. In 2010, Adele received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for "Hometown Glory." In April her song "My Same" entered the German Singles Chart after it had been performed by Lena Meyer-Landrut in the talent show contest ''Unser Star fr Oslo,'' or ''Our Star for Oslo,'' in which the German entry to the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 was determined.
In late September, after being featured on ''The X Factor,'' Adele's version of Bob Dylan's "Make You Feel My Love" re-entered the UK singles chart at number 4. During the 2010 ''CMT Artists of the Year'' special, Adele performed a widely publicised duet of Lady Antebellum's "Need You Now" with Darius Rucker. This performance was later nominated for a CMT Music Award.

=== 20112014: ''21'', worldwide recognition and hiatus ===
thumb|upright|Adele performing in Seattle, Washington, on 12 August 2011
Adele released her second studio album, ''21'', on 24 January 2011 in the UK and 22 February in the US. She said that the album was inspired by the break-up with her former partner. The album's sound is described as classic and contemporary country and roots music. The change in sound from her first album was the result of her bus driver playing contemporary music from Nashville when she was touring the American South, and the title reflected the growth she had experienced in the prior two years. Adele told ''Spin Magazine:'' "It was really exciting for me because I never grew up around [that music]." ''21'' hit number 1 in 30 countries, including the UK and the US.

An emotional performance of "Someone Like You" at the 2011 Brit Awards on 15 February propelled the song to number one in the UK. Her first album, ''19,'' re-entered the UK album chart alongside ''21,'' while first and second singles "Rolling in the Deep" and "Someone Like You" were in the top 5 of the UK singles chart, making Adele the first living artist to achieve the feat of two top-five hits in both the Official Singles Chart and the Official Albums Chart simultaneously since The Beatles in 1964. Both songs topped the charts in multiple markets and broke numerous sales performance records. Following her performance of "Someone Like You" at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, it became Adele's second number-one single on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. By December 2011, ''21'' sold over 3.4million copies in the UK, and became the biggest-selling album of the 21st century, overtaking Amy Winehouse's ''Back to Black'', with Adele becoming the first artist ever to sell three million albums in the UK in one calendar year. "Set Fire to the Rain" became Adele's third number one single on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, as Adele became the first artist ever to have an album, ''21,'' hold the number-one position on the ''Billboard'' 200 concurrently with three number one singles. Moreover, ''21'' had the most weeks on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart of any album by a woman.

To promote the album, Adele embarked upon the "Adele Live" tour, which sold out its North American leg. In October 2011, Adele was forced to cancel two tours because of a vocal-cord haemorrhage. She released a statement saying she needed an extended period of rest to avoid permanent damage to her voice. In the first week of November 2011 Steven M. Zeitels, director of the Center for Laryngeal Surgery and Voice Rehabilitation at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, performed laser microsurgery on Adele's vocal cords to remove a benign polyp.{{Citation | last = Colapinto | first = John | title = Giving Voice : A Surgeon Pioneers Methods to Help Singers Sing Again | journal = The New Yorker | pages = 48 to 57 |date = 4 March 2013 | url =http://www.newyorker.com}} A recording of her tour, ''Live at the Royal Albert Hall,'' was released in November 2011, debuting at number one in the US with 96,000 copies sold, the highest one-week tally for a music DVD in four years, becoming the best-selling music DVD of 2011. Adele is the first artist in Nielsen SoundScan history to have the year's number-one album (''21''), number-one single ("Rolling in the Deep"), and number-one music video. At the 2011 American Music Awards on 20 November, Adele won three awards; Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist, Favorite Adult Contemporary Artist, and Favorite Pop/Rock Album for ''21.'' On 9 December, ''Billboard'' named Adele Artist of the Year, ''Billboard'' 200 Album of the Year (''21''), and the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 Song of the Year ("Rolling in the Deep"), becoming the first woman ever to top all three categories.

Following the throat microsurgery, she made her live comeback at the 2012 Grammy Awards in February. She won in all six categories for which she was nominated, making her the second female artist in Grammy history, after Beyonc, to win that many categories in a single night. Following that success, ''21'' achieved the biggest weekly sales increase following a Grammy win since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking data in 1991. Adele received the Brit Award for Best British Female Solo Artist, and British Album of the Year presented to her by George Michael. Following the Brit Awards, ''21'' reached number one for the 21st non-consecutive week in the UK. The album has sold over 4.5million copies in the UK where it is the fourth best-selling album. In October, the album's sales surpassed 4.5million in the UK, and in November it surpassed 10 million sales in the US.Keith Caulfield (27 November 2012).

Adele is the only artist or band in the last decade in the US to earn an RIAA diamond certification for a one disc album in less than two years.

In October 2012, Adele confirmed that she had been writing, composing and recording the theme song for ''Skyfall,'' the twenty-third James Bond film."[http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/19785659 Adele confirms Skyfall Bond theme song]" BBC Newsbeat.

On 14 October, "Skyfall" rose to number 2 on the UK Singles Chart with sales of 92,000 copies bringing its overall sales to 176,000, and "Skyfall" entered the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 at number 8, selling 261,000 copies in the US in its first three days. This tied "Skyfall" with Duran Duran's "A View to a Kill" as the highest-charting James Bond theme song on the UK Singles Chart; a record surpassed in 2015 by Sam Smith's "Writing's on the Wall".

"Skyfall" has sold more than two million copies worldwide and earned Adele the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and the Academy Award for Best Original Song. In December 2012, Adele was named ''Billboard'' Artist of the Year, and ''21'' was named Album of the Year, making her the first artist to receive both accolades two years in a row. Adele was also named top female artist. The Associated Press named Adele Entertainer of the Year for 2012. The 2013 Grammy Awards saw Adele's live version of "Set Fire to the Rain" win the Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance, bringing her total wins to nine.

On 3 April 2012, Adele confirmed that her third album would likely be at least two years away, stating, "I have to take time and live a little bit. There were a good two years between my first and second albums, so it'll be the same this time." She stated that she would continue writing and composing her own material.Kaufman, Gil (3 April 2012) [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1682315/adele-new-single.jhtml "Adele To Release New Single This Year"].

At the 2013 Grammy Awards, she confirmed that she was in the very early stages of her third album. She also stated that she will most likely work with Paul Epworth again.

In September 2013, Wiz Khalifa confirmed that he and Adele had collaborated on a song for his upcoming fifth studio album, ''Blacc Hollywood,'' though the collaboration did not make the final track listing. In January 2014, Adele received her tenth Grammy Award with "Skyfall" winning Best Song Written for Visual Media at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards. On the eve of her 26th birthday in May 2014, Adele posted a cryptic message via her Twitter account which prompted media discussion about her next album. The message, "Bye bye 25... See you again later in the year," was interpreted by some in the media, including the ''Daily Mail'' and Capital FM, as meaning that her next album would be titled ''25'' and released later in the year. In 2014, Adele was nominated for nine World Music Awards. In early August, Paul Moss suggested that an album would be released in 2014 or 2015. However, in the October 2014 accounts filed with Companies House by XL Recordings, they ruled out a 2014 release.

On 27 August 2015, ''Billboard'' reported that Adele's label, XL Recordings, had intentions of releasing her third studio album sometime in November 2015. Danger Mouse has contributed a song, while Tobias Jesso Jr. has written a track, and Ryan Tedder is "back in the mix after producing and co-writing "Rumour Has It" on ''21''." At the 72nd Venice International Film Festival in early September 2015, Sia announced that her new single "Alive" was co-written by Adele, and had originally been intended for Adele's third album. On 18 October, a 30-second clip of new material from Adele was shown on UK television during a commercial break on ''The X Factor''.

In a statement released three days later she confirmed that the album is titled ''25'', with Adele stating, "My last record was a break-up record, and if I had to label this one, I would call it a make-up record. Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did. ''25'' is about getting to know who I've become without realising. And I'm sorry it took so long but, you know, life happened."

=== Influences and favourite musicians ===
thumb|left|225px|Adele credits the Spice Girls as being a major influence on her love of music
Adele has cited the Spice Girls as a major influence in regard to her love and passion for music, stating that "they made me what I am today". Adele impersonated the Spice Girls at dinner parties as a young girl. She stated she was left "heartbroken" when her favourite Spice Girl, Geri Halliwell aka "Ginger Spice", left the group.[http://www.nowmagazine.co.uk/celebrity-news/280157/adele-geri-halliwell-broke-my-heart "Adele: Geri Halliwell broke my heart"].

She has also stated that growing up, she listened to Sinad O'Connor, The Cure,Matt Doeden (2013). "Adele: Soul Musics Magical Voice". p. 72. Twenty-First Century Books.

Sunday Herald. Retrieved 12 November 2014.
One of Adele's earliest influences was Gabrielle, who Adele has admired since the age of five. During Adele's school years, her mother made her an eye patch with sequins which she used to perform as the Hackney born star in a school talent contest. After moving to south London, she became interested in R&B artists such as Aaliyah, Destiny's Child, and Mary J. Blige. Adele says that one of the most defining moments in her life was when she watched Pink perform at Brixton Academy in London. She states: "It was the ''Missundaztood'' record, so I was about 13 or 14. I had never heard, being in the room, someone sing like that live [] I remember sort of feeling like I was in a wind tunnel, her voice just hitting me. It was incredible."

thumb|upright|As a teenager Adele would listen to Etta James ''(pictured)'' while developing and practising her vocal skills
In 2002, aged 14, Adele discovered Etta James and Ella Fitzgerald as she stumbled on the artists' CDs in the jazz section of her local music store. She was struck by their appearance on the album covers. Adele states she then "started listening to Etta James every night for an hour," and in the process was getting "to know my own voice." Adele credits Amy Winehouse and her 2003 album ''Frank'' for inspiring her to take up the guitar, stating, "If it wasn't for Amy and ''Frank'', one hundred per cent I wouldn't have picked up a guitar, I wouldn't have written "Daydreamer" or "Hometown [Glory]" and I wrote "Someone Like You" on the guitar too." She also states that her mother, who is very close to her, exposed her to the music of Aaliyah, Lauryn Hill, Mary J. Blige, and Alicia Keys, all of whom inspired her as well. She is also a fan of Lana Del Rey, Grimes, Chvrches, FKA Twigs, Alabama Shakes, Kanye West, Rihanna, Frank Ocean, and Stevie Nicks. In 2017, she described Beyonc as a particular inspiration, calling her "my artist of my life" and added "the other artists who mean that much to me are all dead." Adele cited Madonna's album ''Ray of Light'' as a "chief inspiration" behind her album ''25''.

===Musical style===
Adele's first album, ''19'', is of the soul genre, with lyrics describing heartbreak and relationship. Her success occurred simultaneously with several other British female soul singers, with the British press dubbing her a new Amy Winehouse. This was described as a third British Musical Invasion of the US. However, Adele called the comparisons between her and other female soul singers lazy, noting "we're a gender, not a genre". AllMusic wrote that "Adele is simply too magical to compare her to anyone."

Her second album, ''21'', shares the folk and soul influences of her debut album, but was further inspired by the American country and Southern blues music to which she had been exposed during her 200809 North American tour An Evening with Adele. Composed in the aftermath of Adele's separation from her partner, the album typifies the near dormant tradition of the confessional singer-songwriter in its exploration of heartbreak, self-examination, and forgiveness. Having referred to ''21'' as a "break-up record", Adele labelled her third studio album, ''25'', a "make-up record", adding it was about "Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did." Her yearning for her old self, her nostalgia, and melancholy about the passage of time, is a feature of ''25'', with Adele stating, "I've had a lot of regrets since I turned 25. And sadness hits me in different ways than it used to. There's a lot of things I don't think I'll ever get 'round to doing."

{{Quote box|width=30%||align=right|style=padding:8px|quote="Clutching a Brits Critics' Choice Award before she'd even released her debut album, Adele had what seems like pre-ordained success, but it never would have happened without her extraordinary voice. Appropriately, her big, smoky pipes enter tonight before she does  singing from the wings, before she suddenly emerges, cackling "Awright Leeds." These first few seconds encapsulate her special connection with the public. A peculiar mixture of the sublime and the mundane. One minute she's adding an eerie tremor to the lyric "Of my world", the next she's explaining to the people pondering aloud just how one might Set Fire to the Rain, that the song was inspired "when mah lightah stopped workin'" in the wet."|source=Dave Simpson of ''The Guardian'' on her voice and down to earth manner.}}

thumb|left|Adele singing at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee during her Adele Live 2016 tour
Adele is a mezzo-soprano with a range spanning from C3 to B5. However Classic FM state she is often mistaken for a contralto due to the application of a tense chest mix to achieve her lower notes, whilst also noting that her voice becomes its clearest as she ascends the register, particularly from C4 to C5. ''Rolling Stone'' reported that following throat surgery her voice had become "palpably bigger and purer-toned", and that she had added a further four notes to the top of her range. Initially, critics suggested that her vocals were more developed and intriguing than her songwriting, a sentiment with which Adele agreed. She has stated: "I taught myself how to sing by listening to Ella Fitzgerald for acrobatics and scales, Etta James for passion and Roberta Flack for control."

Her voice has received acclaim from critics. In a review of ''19'', ''The Observer'' said, "The way she stretched the vowels, her wonderful soulful phrasing, the sheer unadulterated pleasure of her voice, stood out all the more; little doubt that she's a rare singer". BBC Music wrote, "Her melodies exude warmth, her singing is occasionally stunning and, ...she has tracks that make Lily Allen and Kate Nash sound every bit as ordinary as they are." For their reviews of ''21'', ''The New York Times''{{'}} chief music critic Jon Pareles commended Adele's emotive timbre, comparing her to Dusty Springfield, Petula Clark, and Annie Lennox: "[Adele] can seethe, sob, rasp, swoop, lilt and belt, in ways that draw more attention to the song than to the singer". Ryan Reed of ''Paste'' magazine regarded her voice as "a raspy, aged-beyond-its-years thing of full-blooded beauty", while MSN Music's Tom Townshend declared her "the finest singer of [our] generation".

==Personal life and other ventures==
Adele began dating charity entrepreneur and Old Etonian Simon Konecki in the summer of 2011. In June 2012, Adele announced that she and Konecki were expecting a baby. Their son Angelo was born on 19 October 2012. On the topic of becoming a parent, Adele observed that she "felt like I was truly living. I had a purpose, where before I didn't". Adele and Konecki brought a privacy case against a UK-based photo agency that published intrusive paparazzi images of their son taken during family outings in 2013. Lawyers working on their behalf accepted damages from the company in July 2014. Adele has also stated that she has suffered from postnatal depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and panic attacks.

In early 2017, tabloids started speculating that Adele and Konecki had secretly married when they were spotted wearing matching rings on their ring fingers. During her acceptance speech at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards for Album of the Year, Adele confirmed their marriage by calling Konecki her husband when thanking him. She subsequently clarified her marital status in March 2017, telling the audience at a concert in Brisbane, Australia, "I'm married now".

Politically she is a supporter of the Labour Party, stating in 2011 that she was a "Labour girl through and through", although, in May 2011, she advocated a lower tax rate for high-income earners; a view counter to that of the Labour Party. In 2015, Adele stated "I'm a feminist, I believe that everyone should be treated the same, including race and sexuality". In 2017, Adele was ranked the richest musician under 30 years old in the UK and Ireland in the ''Sunday Times Rich List'', which valued her wealth at 125 million. She was ranked the 19th richest musician overall.

She is an icon for the LGBT community.[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/adele-son-sexuality-time-magazine-interview_us_56796159e4b0b958f657e68c "Adele's Comment About Her Sons Sexuality Is Absolutely Perfect"]. Huffington Post. 14 June 2016 On 12 June 2016 an emotional Adele dedicated her show in Antwerp, Belgium to the victims of the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, earlier that day, adding "The LGBTQ community, they're like my soul mates since I was really young, so I'm very moved by it." In April 2018 it was widely reported that Adele had become an ordained minister in order to officiate at close friend comedian Alan Carr's wedding to Paul Drayton, something which Adele herself subsequently confirmed. The wedding, held in January 2018, took place in the garden of her house in Los Angeles. However, the news prompted Tim Worstall of ''The Continental Telegraph'' to observe that ordination in itself would not have allowed Adele to conduct the marriage under California law, and that she would have needed to apply to become a "one-time deputy marriage commissioner", a role similar to that of a Justice of the peace and known as becoming a "JP for a day": "Its certainly a cute story that Adele is now the Rev Miss Adele but its not really what happened."

Four days later she appeared at Chelsea fire station and brought cakes for the firefighters. Station manager Ben King stated "She came in, came up to the mess and had a cup of tea with the watch and then she joined us for the minutes silence." Paying tribute to the victims at her first Wembley show on 28 June, Adele encouraged fans to donate money to help the victims of the blaze rather than waste the money on "overpriced wine".[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-40440509 "Adele pays tribute to Grenfell victims at Wembley Stadium show"].
