Ford is married to actress Calista Flockhart.

==Early life==
Ford was born at the Swedish Covenant Hospital in Chicago, Illinois to Christopher Ford (born John William Ford), an advertising executive and former actor, and Dorothy (ne Nidelman), a former radio actress. A younger brother, Terence, was born in 1945. His father was Catholic and his mother was Jewish.[https://www.theguardian.com/film/interview/interviewpages/0,,2275988,00.html 'Keeping up with Indiana Jones'], The Guardian, April 27, 2008 Ford's paternal grandparents, John Fitzgerald Ford and Florence Veronica Niehaus, were of Irish and German descent, respectively. Ford's maternal grandparents, Harry Nidelman and Anna Lifschutz, were Jewish emigrants from Minsk, Belarus (at that time a part of the Russian Empire). When asked in which religion he and his brother were raised, Ford jokingly responded, "Democrat," "to be liberals of every stripe".[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/theticket/2011/0819/1224302657898.html 'I've had my time'], Tara Brady, The Irish Times, August 19, 2011 In a television interview shown in August 2000, when asked about what influence his Irish Catholic and Russian Jewish ancestry may have had on his life as a person and as an artist, Ford humorously stated, "As a man I've always felt Irish, as an actor I've always felt Jewish."''Inside the Actors Studio''. Harrison Ford, Season 6, Episode 613. August 20, 2000.

Ford was active in the Boy Scouts of America, and achieved its second-highest rank, Life Scout. He worked at Napowan Adventure Base Scout camp as a counselor for the Reptile Study merit badge. Because of this, he and director Steven Spielberg later decided to depict the young Indiana Jones as a Life Scout in the film ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade''.

In 1960, Ford graduated from Maine East High School in Park Ridge, Illinois. His was the first student voice broadcast on his high school's new radio station, WMTH, and he was its first sportscaster during his senior year (195960). He attended Ripon College in Wisconsin, where he was a philosophy major and a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity. He took a drama class in the final quarter of his senior year to get over his shyness. Ford, a self-described "late bloomer," became fascinated with acting.

==Early career==
In 1964, after a season of summer stock with the Belfry Players in Wisconsin,Franzene, Jessica, "Theologians & Thespians," in Welcome Home, a realtors' guide to property history in the Lake Geneva region, August 2012 Ford traveled to Los Angeles to apply for a job in radio voice-overs. He did not get it, but stayed in California and eventually signed a $150-a-week contract with Columbia Pictures' new talent program, playing bit roles in films. His first known role was an uncredited one as a bellhop in ''Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round'' (1966). There is little record of his non-speaking roles (or "extra" work) in film. Ford was at the bottom of the hiring list, having offended producer Jerry Tokovsky after he played a bellboy in the feature. He was told by Tokovsky that when actor Tony Curtis delivered a bag of groceries, he did it like a movie star; Ford felt his job was to act like a bellboy. Ford managed to secure other roles in movies, such as ''A Time for Killing (The Long Ride Home)'', starring Glenn Ford; George Hamilton; and Inger Stevens.

His speaking roles continued next with ''Luv'' (1967), though he was still uncredited. He was finally credited as "Harrison J. Ford" in the 1967 Western film ''A Time for Killing'', but the "J" did not stand for anything, since he has no middle name. It was added to avoid confusion with a silent film actor named Harrison Ford, who appeared in more than 80 films between 1915 and 1932 and died in 1957. Ford later said that he was unaware of the existence of the earlier actor until he came upon a star with his own name on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Ford soon dropped the "J" and worked for Universal Studios, playing minor roles in many television series throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, including ''Gunsmoke'', ''Ironside'', ''The Virginian'', ''The F.B.I.'', ''Love, American Style'', and ''Kung Fu''. He appeared in the western ''Journey to Shiloh'' (1968) and had an uncredited, non-speaking role in Michelangelo Antonioni's 1970 film ''Zabriskie Point'' as an arrested student protester. Not happy with the roles being offered to him, Ford became a self-taught professional carpenter to support his then-wife and two young sons.

Casting director and fledgling producer Fred Roos championed the young Ford and secured him an audition with George Lucas for the role of Bob Falfa, which Ford went on to play in ''American Graffiti'' (1973). Ford's relationship with Lucas would profoundly affect his career later on. After director Francis Ford Coppola's film ''The Godfather'' was a success, he hired Ford to expand his office and gave him small roles in his next two films, ''The Conversation'' (1974) and ''Apocalypse Now'' (1979); in the latter film he played an army officer named "G. Lucas".

==Milestone franchises==

===''Star Wars''===
Harrison Ford's previous work in ''American Graffiti'' eventually landed him his first starring film role, when he was hired by Lucas to read lines for actors auditioning for roles in his then-upcoming film ''Star Wars'' (1977). Lucas was eventually won over by Ford's performance during these line reads and cast him as Han Solo.Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy. Star Wars Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary. [2005] ''Star Wars'' became one of the most successful movies of all time and established Ford as a superstar. He went on to star in the similarly successful ''Star Wars'' sequels, ''The Empire Strikes Back'' (1980) and ''Return of the Jedi'' (1983), as well as the ''Star Wars Holiday Special'' (1978). Ford wanted Lucas to kill off Han Solo at the end of ''Return of the Jedi'', saying, "That would have given the whole film a bottom," but Lucas refused. 

Ford reprised the role of Han Solo in the sequel ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' (2015). During filming on June 11, 2014, Ford suffered what was said to be a fractured ankle, when a hydraulic door fell on him. He was rushed to hospital for treatment. Ford's son Ben released details on his father's injury, saying that his ankle would likely need a plate and screws, and that filming could be altered slightly with the crew needing to shoot Ford from the waist up for a short time until he recovered. Ford made his return to filming in mid-August, after a two-month layoff as he recovered from his injury. Ford's character was killed off in ''The Force Awakens''; however, it was subsequently announced, via a casting call, that Ford would return in some capacity as Han Solo in ''Episode VIII''. In February 2016, when the cast for ''Episode VIII'' was confirmed, it was indicated that Ford would not reprise his role in the film. When Ford was asked if his character could come back in "some form", he replied, "Anything is possible in space." A Han Solo spin-off movie, ''Solo: A Star Wars Story'', was released in May 2018, but Ford was not involved in the production.

===''Indiana Jones''===

Ford's status as a leading actor was solidified when he starred as globe-trotting archeologist Indiana Jones in the film ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' (1981), a collaboration between George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. Though Spielberg was interested in casting Ford from the beginning, Lucas was not, due to having already worked with the actor in ''American Graffiti'' and ''Star Wars'', but he eventually relented after Tom Selleck was unable to accept.(DVD) Indiana Jones: Making the Trilogy. Paramount Pictures. 2003.

Ford went on to star in the prequel ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' (1984) and the sequel ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' (1989). He returned to the role yet again for a 1993 episode of the television series ''The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles'', and even later for the fourth film ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'' (2008). On March 15, 2016 Walt Disney Studios announced that Ford is scheduled to appear in a fifth film due for release in July 2019. However on April 25, 2017 Walt Disney Studios announced that the film will be released on July 10, 2020.

==Other film work==
Ford has been in other films, including ''Heroes'' (1977), ''Force 10 from Navarone'' (1978), and ''Hanover Street'' (1979). Ford also co-starred alongside Gene Wilder in the buddy-Western ''The Frisco Kid'' (1979), playing a bank robber with a heart of gold. He then starred as Rick Deckard in Ridley Scott's cult sci-fi classic ''Blade Runner'' (1982), and in a number of dramatic-action films: Peter Weir's ''Witness'' (1985) and ''The Mosquito Coast'' (1986), and Roman Polanski's ''Frantic'' (1988).

The 1990s brought Ford the role of Jack Ryan in Tom Clancy's ''Patriot Games'' (1992) and ''Clear and Present Danger'' (1994); as well as leading roles in Alan Pakula's ''Presumed Innocent'' (1990) and ''The Devil's Own'' (1997); Andrew Davis' ''The Fugitive ''(1993); Sydney Pollack's remake of ''Sabrina ''(1995); and Wolfgang Petersen's ''Air Force One'' (1997). Ford also played straight dramatic roles, including an adulterous husband in both ''Presumed Innocent'' (1990) and ''What Lies Beneath'' (2000), and a recovering amnesiac in Mike Nichols' ''Regarding Henry'' (1991).

Many of Ford's major film roles came to him by default through unusual circumstances: he won the role of Han Solo while reading lines for other actors, was cast as Indiana Jones because Tom Selleck was not available, he also took over the role of Jack Ryan supposedly due to Alec Baldwin's fee demands, Baldwin had previously played the role of Ryan in ''The Hunt for Red October''.

===1990s2010s===
thumb|upright|Ford in 2017
Starting in the late 1990s, Ford appeared in several critically derided and commercially disappointing movies, including ''Six Days, Seven Nights'' (1998); ''Random Hearts'' (1999); ''K-19: The Widowmaker'' (2002); ''Hollywood Homicide'' (2003); ''Firewall'' (2006); and ''Extraordinary Measures'' (2010). One exception was 2000's ''What Lies Beneath,'' which grossed over $155million in the United States and $291million worldwide.  In the 2001 ''Guinness Book of World Records'', Ford was listed as the richest male actor in the world.

In 2004, Ford declined a chance to star in the thriller ''Syriana'', later commenting that "I didn't feel strongly enough about the truth of the material and I think I made a mistake." The role eventually went to George Clooney, who won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for his work. Prior to that, he had passed on a role in another Stephen Gaghan-written role, Robert Wakefield in ''Traffic''. That role went to Michael Douglas.

In 2008, Ford enjoyed success with the release of ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'', another Lucas/Spielberg collaboration. The film received generally positive reviews and was the second highest-grossing film worldwide in 2008. He later said he would like to star in another sequel, "...if it didn't take another 20 years to digest."

Other 2008 work included ''Crossing Over'', directed by Wayne Kramer. In the film, he plays an ICE / Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent, working alongside Ashley Judd and Ray Liotta. He also narrated a feature documentary film about the Dalai Lama entitled ''Dalai Lama Renaissance''.
thumb|left|upright|Ford at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival

Ford filmed the medical drama ''Extraordinary Measures'' in 2009 in Portland, Oregon. Released January 22, 2010, the film also starred Brendan Fraser and Alan Ruck. Also in 2010, he co-starred in the film ''Morning Glory,'' along with Patrick Wilson, Rachel McAdams, and Diane Keaton.

In July 2011, Ford starred alongside Daniel Craig and Olivia Wilde in the science fiction Western film ''Cowboys & Aliens''. To promote the film, Ford appeared at the San Diego Comic-Con International and, apparently surprised by the warm welcome, told the audience, "I just wanted to make a living as an actor. I didn't know about this."

In 2011, Ford starred in Japanese commercials advertising the video game ''Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception'' for the PlayStation 3. In 2013, Ford co-starred in the corporate espionage thriller ''Paranoia'', with Liam Hemsworth and Gary Oldman, and directed by Robert Luketic, as well as ''Ender's Game'', ''42'', and ''Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues''.

On February 26, 2015, Alcon Entertainment announced Ford would reprise his role as Rick Deckard in ''Blade Runner 2049''. ''The Economist'' has described Ford's appearance in the film as "little more than a cameo", despite his being used heavily in the film's promotion. The film grossed $259.3million worldwide, far short of the estimated $400million that the film needed to gross in order to break even.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and family===
Ford is one of Hollywood's most private actors, guarding much of his personal life. He has two sons, Benjamin (born 1966) and Willard (born 1969), with his first wife, Mary Marquardt, to whom he was married from 1964 until their divorce in 1979. With his second wife, screenwriter Melissa Mathison, whom he married in March 1983 and from whom he was separated in August 2001 and eventually divorced, he has two more children, Malcolm and Georgia (born 1990).

Ford flies his de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver (N28S) more than any of his other aircraft, and has repeatedly said that he likes this aircraft and the sound of its Pratt & Whitney R-985 radial engine.[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/05/21/harrison-ford-discusses-p_n_102891.html "Harrison Ford Discusses Piloting His Beaver into the Bush"], ''Huffington Post'', May 21, 2008. According to Ford, it had been flown in the CIA's Air America operations, and was riddled with bullet holes that had to be patched up.Per Ford's remarks on ''Late Night with David Letterman'' (viewed July 9, 2008).

In March 2004, Ford officially became chairman of the Young Eagles program of the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA). Ford was asked to take the position by Greg Anderson, Senior Vice President of the EAA at the time, to replace General Charles "Chuck" Yeager, who was vacating the post that he had held for many years. Ford at first was hesitant, but later accepted the offer and has made appearances with the Young Eagles at the EAA AirVenture Oshkosh gathering at Oshkosh, Wisconsin, for two years. In July 2005, at the gathering in Oshkosh, Ford agreed to accept the position for another two years. Ford has flown over 280 children as part of the Young Eagles program, usually in his DHC-2 Beaver, which can seat the actor and five children. He is involved with the EAA chapter in Driggs, Idaho, just over the Teton Range from Jackson, Wyoming. On July 28, 2016, Ford flew the two millionth Young Eagle at the EAA AirVenture convention.

As of 2009, Ford appears in Internet advertisements for General Aviation Serves America, a campaign by the advocacy group Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA).

====Incidents====
On October 23, 1999, Harrison Ford was involved in the crash of a Bell 206L4 LongRanger helicopter (N36R). The NTSB accident report states that Ford was piloting the aircraft over the Lake Piru riverbed near Santa Clarita, California, on a routine training flight. While making his second attempt at an autorotation with powered recovery, Ford allowed the aircraft's altitude to drop to 150200 feet before beginning power-up. The aircraft was unable to recover power before hitting the ground. The aircraft landed hard and began skidding forward in the loose gravel before one of its skids struck a partially embedded log, flipping the aircraft onto its side. Neither Ford nor the instructor pilot suffered any injuries, though the helicopter was seriously damaged. When asked about the incident by fellow pilot James Lipton in an interview on the TV show ''Inside the Actor's Studio'', Ford replied, "I broke it."

On March 5, 2015, Ford's plane, believed to be a Ryan PT-22 Recruit, made an emergency landing on the Penmar Golf Course in Venice, California. Ford had radioed in to report that the plane had experienced engine failure. He was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where he was reported to be in fair to moderate condition. Ford suffered a broken pelvis and broken ankle during the accident, as well as other injuries.

On February 13, 2017, Ford landed an Aviat Husky at John Wayne Airport on the taxiway left of runway 20L. A Boeing 737 was holding short of the runway on the taxiway when Ford overflew them.

==Activism==
===Environmental causes===
Ford is vice-chair of Conservation International an American nonprofit environmental organization headquartered in Arlington, Virginia. The organization's intent is to protect nature. The institution tries to combine the services or benefits of science, field work, and partnership to find global solutions to global problems. Three ways CI goes about solving nature-related problems are: 1) identifying and moving to protect locations that are crucial, such as those affecting water, food, and air; 2) working with large companies that are involved in energy and agriculture, to ensure the environment is being protected; and 3) working with governments to ensure they have the knowledge and the proper tools to construct policies that are environmentally friendly.

From its origins as an NGO dedicated to protecting tropical biodiversity, CI has evolved into an organization that works with governments, scientists, charitable foundations, and business. CI has been criticised for links to companies with a poor environmental record such as BP, Cargill, Chevron, Monsanto and Shell and for allegedly offering greenwashing services. CI has also been chastised for poor judgment in its expenditure of donors' money.

In September 2013, Ford, while filming an environmental documentary in Indonesia, interviewed the Indonesian Forestry Minister, Zulkifli Hasan. After the interview the Presidential Advisor, Andi Arief, accused Ford and his crew of "harassing state institutions" and publicly threatened them with deportation. Questions within the interview concerned the Tesso Nilo National Park, Sumatra. It was alleged the Minister of Forestry was given no prior warning of questions nor the chance to explain the challenges of catching people with illegal logging. Ford was provided an audience with the Indonesian President, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, during which he expressed concerns regarding Indonesia's environmental degradation and the government efforts to address climate change. In response, the President explained Indonesia's commitment to preserving its oceans and forests.

In 1993, the arachnologist Norman Platnick named a new species of spider ''Calponia harrisonfordi'', and in 2002, the entomologist Edward O. Wilson named a new ant species ''Pheidole harrisonfordi'' (in recognition of Harrison's work as Vice Chairman of Conservation International).

Since 1992, Ford has lent his voice to a series of public service messages promoting environmental involvement for EarthShare, an American federation of environmental and conservation charities.

Ford has been a spokesperson for Restore Hetch Hetchy, a non-profit organization dedicated to restoring Yosemite National Park's Hetch Hetchy Valley to its original condition.

Ford appears in the documentary series ''Years of Living Dangerously'', which provides reports on those affected by, and seeking solutions to, climate change.

===Political views===
Like his parents, Ford is a lifelong Democrat.

On September 7, 1995, Ford testified before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee in support of the Dalai Lama and an independent Tibet.Laurence Caracalla, ''Harrison Ford'', Silverback Books, 2007 p.93 In 2007, he narrated the documentary ''Dalai Lama Renaissance''.[http://dalailamafilm.com/ "Official Site of Dalai Lama Renaissance"], ''dalailamafilm.com'', Retrieved November 30, 2015

In 2003, he publicly condemned the Iraq War and called for "regime change" in the United States. He also criticized Hollywood for making movies which were "more akin to video games than stories about human life and relationships", and he called for more gun control in the United States.

After Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said his favorite role of Ford's was ''Air Force One'' because he "stood up for America", Ford reasoned that it was just a film and was doubtful that Trump's presidential bid would be successful.

===Archaeology===
Following on his success portraying the archaeologist Indiana Jones, Ford also plays a part in supporting the work of professional archaeologists. He serves as a General Trustee on the Governing Board of the Archaeological Institute of America (AIA), North America's oldest and largest organization devoted to the world of archaeology. Ford assists them in their mission of increasing public awareness of archaeology and preventing looting and the illegal antiquities trade.

===Star Wars: Force for Change===
