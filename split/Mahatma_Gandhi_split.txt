______SCHOOL______
' teach' ' authorit' ' class' 
The Indian classics, especially the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra, had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood.
______________________________
His mother came from the medieval Krishna bhakti-based Pranami tradition, whose religious texts include the ''Bhagavad Gita'', the ''Bhagavata Purana'', and a collection of 14 texts with teachings that the tradition believes to include the essence of the Vedas, the Quran and the Bible.
______________________________
Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, Gandhi took the administration by surprise and won concessions from the authorities.
______________________________
After Gandhi's arrest, the women marched and picketed shops on their own, accepting violence and verbal abuse from British authorities for the cause in a manner Gandhi inspired.
______________________________
The British questioned Congress party and Gandhi's authority to speak for all of India.
______________________________
Nehru used the assassination to consolidate the authority of the new Indian state.
______________________________
The most profound influence on Gandhi were those from Hinduism, Christianity and Jainism, states Parekh, with his thoughts "in harmony with the classical Indian traditions, specially the Advaita or monistic tradition".
______________________________
For example, in 1935, N. A. Toothi stated that Gandhi was influenced by the reforms and teachings of the Swaminarayan tradition of Hinduism.
______________________________
Gandhi saw himself a disciple of Tolstoy, for they agreed regarding opposition to state authority and colonialism; both hated violence and preached non-resistance.
______________________________
It did not lead to inner transformation or moral advance or to the Christian teaching of "love", but was based on false one-sided criticisms of other religions, when Christian societies faced similar problems in South Africa and Europe.
______________________________
According to Gandhi, the message of Jesus wasn't to humiliate and imperialistically rule over other people considering them inferior or second class or slaves, but that "when the hungry are fed and peace comes to our individual and collective life, then Christ is born".
______________________________
He stated in 1925, for example, that he had not criticised the teachings of the Quran, but he did criticise the interpreters of Quran.
______________________________
According to Christophe Jaffrelot, while Gandhi considered untouchability to be wrong and evil, he believed that caste or class are based neither on inequality nor on inferiority.
______________________________
Swaraj to Gandhi did not mean transferring colonial era British power brokering system, favours-driven, bureaucratic, class exploitative structure and mindset into Indian hands.
______________________________
Andrews, Gandhi stated that if we believe all religions teach the same message of love and peace between all human beings, then there is neither any rationale nor need for proselytisation or attempts to convert people from one religion to another.
______________________________
Gandhi refused to endorse the view that economic forces are best understood as "antagonistic class interests".
______________________________
I have nothing new to teach the world.

______________________________
There he died about 30 minutes later as one of Gandhi's family members read verses from Hindu scriptures.
______________________________
According to Bhikhu Parekh, three books that influenced Gandhi most in South Africa were William Salter's ''Ethical Religion'' (1889); Henry David Thoreau's ''On the Duty of Civil Disobedience'' (1849); and Leo Tolstoy's ''The Kingdom of God Is Within You'' (1894).
______________________________
====Religious texts====
During his stay in South Africa, along with scriptures and philosophical texts of Hinduism and other Indian religions, Gandhi read translated texts of Christianity such as the Bible, and Islam such as the Quran.
______________________________
Gandhi accepted this and began having Muslim prayers read in Hindu temples to play his part, but was unable to get Hindu prayers read in mosques.
______________________________
At other times, he acknowledged that he knew little about Buddhism other than his reading of Edwin Arnold's book on it.
______________________________
According to the 1960s memoir of his grandniece Manu, Gandhi feared in early 1947 that he and she may be killed by Muslims in the run up to India's independence in August 1947, and asked her when she was 18-year-old if she wanted to help him with his experiments to test their "purity", for which she readily accepted.
______________________________
The book was translated into English the next year, with a copyright legend that read "No Rights Reserved".
______________________________
Gandhi also wrote several books including his autobiography, ''The Story of My Experiments with Truth (Gujart "   ")'', of which he bought the entire first edition to make sure it was reprinted.
