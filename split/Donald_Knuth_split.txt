'''Donald Ervin Knuth''' ({{IPAc-en|k|||n|u|}} {{respell|k|NOOTH|'}}; born January 10, 1938) is an American computer scientist, mathematician, and professor emeritus at Stanford University.
______________________________
==Biography==
===Early life===
Knuth was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to German-Americans Ervin Henry Knuth and Louise Marie Bohning.
______________________________
Just before publishing the first volume of ''The Art of Computer Programming'', Knuth left Caltech to accept employment with the Institute for Defense Analyses' Communications Research Division, then situated on the Princeton University campus, which was performing mathematical research in cryptography to support the National Security Agency.
______________________________
Knuth then left this position to join the Stanford University faculty, where he is now Fletcher Jones Professor of Computer Science, Emeritus.https://profiles.stanford.edu/donald-knuth

== Writings ==
Knuth is a writer as well as a computer scientist.

(Several students from the civil engineering department got up and quietly left the room.)

______MULTILINGUAL______
' multilingual' ' language' ' speak' ' foreign' 
In addition to fundamental contributions in several branches of theoretical computer science, Knuth is the creator of the TeX computer typesetting system, the related METAFONT font definition language and rendering system, and the Computer Modern family of typefaces.
______________________________
He accepted a commission to write a book on computer programming language compilers.
______________________________
Knuth is also an occasional contributor of language puzzles to ''Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics''.
______________________________
In 1989, his Chinese name was placed atop the ''Journal of Computer Science and Technology''{{'s}} header, which Knuth says "makes me feel close to all Chinese people although I cannot speak your language".

______SCHOOLING______
' school' ' education' ' home' ' self' ' self taught' 
As prizes, the school received a new television and enough candy bars for all of his schoolmates to eat.
______________________________
After reading the computer's manual, Knuth decided to rewrite the assembly and compiler code for the machine used in his school, because he believed he could do it better.
______________________________
In 1958, Knuth created a program to help his school's basketball team win their games.
______________________________
Knuth published his first "scientific" article in a school magazine in 1957 under the title "The Potrzebie System of Weights and Measures."

______SCHOOL______
' teach' ' authorit' ' class' 
His father had two jobs: running a small printing company and teaching bookkeeping at Milwaukee Lutheran High School.
______________________________
The preface of ''Concrete Mathematics'' has the following paragraph:When DEK taught Concrete Mathematics at Stanford for the first time, he explained the somewhat strange title by saying that it was his attempt to teach a math course that was hard instead of soft.
______________________________
He announced that, contrary to the expectations of his colleagues, he was ''not'' going to teach the Theory of Aggregates, nor Stone's Embedding Theorem, nor even the Stoneech compactification.
______________________________
Also that year, he retired from regular research and teaching at Stanford University in order to finish ''The Art of Computer Programming''.
______________________________
Knuth was elected as a Fellow (first class of Fellows) of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics in 2009 for his outstanding contributions to mathematics.
______________________________

______GRADUATING______
' PhD' ' diploma' ' college' ' drop out' ' dropping out' ' left schoo' 
In 1963, with mathematician Marshall Hall as his adviser, he earned a PhD in mathematics from the California Institute of Technology.
______________________________
===Early work===
After receiving his PhD, Knuth joined Caltech's faculty as an associate professor.
______________________________

______READING______
' read' ' books' 
After reading the computer's manual, Knuth decided to rewrite the assembly and compiler code for the machine used in his school, because he believed he could do it better.
______________________________
Bill Gates has praised the difficulty of the subject matter in ''The Art of Computer Programming'', stating, "If you think you're a really good programmer... You should definitely send me a rsum if you can read the whole thing."

===Humor===

thumb|right|"Nested [[parentheses|parens"Donald Knuth (on Jacob Appelbaum's shirt within the two parentheses), Jacob Appelbaum, and Donald Knuth]]
Knuth used to pay a finder's fee of $2.56 for any typographical errors or mistakes discovered in his books, because "256 pennies is one hexadecimal dollar", and $0.32 for "valuable suggestions".
