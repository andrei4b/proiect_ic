==Early life and career==
{{Main|Early life and career of Julius Caesar}}
thumb|upright|Gaius Marius, Caesar's uncle
Caesar was born into a patrician family, the ''gens Julia'', which claimed descent from Iulus, son of the legendary Trojan prince Aeneas, supposedly the son of the goddess Venus.
______________________________
The ''cognomen'' "Caesar" originated, according to Pliny the Elder, with an ancestor who was born by Caesarean section (from the Latin verb to cut, ''caedere'', ''caes-'').Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+7.7 7.7].
______________________________
The misconception that Julius Caesar himself was born by Caesarian section dates back at least to the 10th century (''Suda'' [http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?db=REAL&search_method=QUERY&login=guest&enlogin=guest&user_list=LIST&page_num=1&field=adlerhw_gr&searchstr=kappa%2C1199 kappa 1199]).
______________________________
Julius wasn't the first to bear the name, and in his time the procedure was only performed on dead women, while Caesar's mother Aurelia lived long after he was born.
______________________________
Ironically, the loss of his priesthood had allowed him to pursue a military career, as the high priest of Jupiter was not permitted to touch a horse, sleep three nights outside his own bed or one night outside Rome, or look upon an army.William Smith, ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'': ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Flamen.html Flamen]''

Caesar felt that it would be much safer far away from Sulla should the Dictator change his mind, so he left Rome and joined the army, serving under Marcus Minucius Thermus in Asia and Servilius Isauricus in Cilicia.
______________________________
Even so, to avoid becoming a private citizen and thus open to prosecution for his debts, Caesar left for his province before his praetorship had ended.
______________________________
If he were to celebrate a triumph, he would have to remain a soldier and stay outside the city until the ceremony, but to stand for election he would need to lay down his command and enter Rome as a private citizen.
______________________________
The term of his governorship, and thus his immunity from prosecution, was set at five years, rather than the usual one.Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#44.4 2:44.4]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#14.10 14.10], ''Crassus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#14.3 14.3], ''Pompey'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#48 48], ''Cato the Younger'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Minor*.html#33.3 33.3]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#22 22]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/38*.html#8.5 38:8.5] When his consulship ended, Caesar narrowly avoided prosecution for the irregularities of his year in office, and quickly left for his province.Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#23 23]

Caesar was still deeply in debt, but there was money to be made as a governor, whether by extortionSee Cicero's speeches against Verres for an example of a former provincial governor successfully prosecuted for illegally enriching himself at his province's expense.
______________________________
The Romans feared these tribes were preparing to migrate south, closer to Italy, and that they had warlike intent.
______________________________
Heading for Spain, Caesar left Italy under the control of Mark Antony.
______________________________
Plutarch writes that many Romans found the triumph held following Caesar's victory to be in poor taste, as those defeated in the civil war had not been foreigners, but instead fellow Romans.Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#56 56.756.8] On Caesar's return to Italy in September 45 BC, he filed his will, naming his grandnephew Gaius Octavius (Octavian, later known as Augustus Caesar) as his principal heir, leaving his vast estate and property including his name.
______________________________
Caesar also wrote that if Octavian died before Caesar did, Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus would be the next heir in succession.Appian, ''The Civil Wars'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/2*.html#143 2:143.1] In his will, he also left a substantial gift to the citizens of Rome.
______________________________
When Arsinoe IV, Egypt's former queen, was paraded in chains, the spectators admired her dignified bearing and were moved to pity.Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' 43.19.23; Appian, ''Civil Wars'' 2.101.420 Triumphal games were held, with beast-hunts involving 400 lions, and gladiator contests.
______________________________
The calendar was then regulated by the movement of the moon, and this had left it in a mess.
______________________________
This addressed the underlying problem that had caused the Social War decades earlier, where individuals outside Rome and Italy were not considered "Roman", thus were not given full citizenship rights.
______________________________
They were met with silence, as the citizens of Rome had locked themselves inside their houses as soon as the rumour of what had taken place had begun to spread.
______________________________
To his surprise and chagrin, Caesar had named his grandnephew Gaius Octavius his sole heir (hence the name Octavian), bequeathing him the immensely potent Caesar name and making him one of the wealthiest citizens in the Republic.Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#83.2 83.2]

The crowd at the funeral boiled over, throwing dry branches, furniture, and even clothing on to Caesar's funeral pyre, causing the flames to spin out of control, seriously damaging the Forum.

It has no basis in historical fact and Shakespeare's use of Latin here is not from any assertion that Caesar would have been using the language, rather than the Greek reported by Suetonius, but because the phrase was already popular when the play was written, as it appears in Richard Edes's Latin play ''Caesar Interfectus'' of 1582 and ''The True Tragedie of Richarde Duke of Yorke & etc.''

===Politics===
{{Main|Caesarism}}
Julius Caesar is seen as the main example of ''Caesarism'', a form of political rule led by a charismatic strongman whose rule is based upon a cult of personality, whose rationale is the need to rule by force, establishing a violent social order, and being a regime involving prominence of the military in the government.|page=34}} Other people in history, such as the French Napoleon Bonaparte and the Italian Benito Mussolini, have defined themselves as Caesarists.

As a result, Caesar found himself with no other options but to cross the Rubicon with the 13th Legion, leaving his province and illegally entering Roman Italy under arms.

The term of his governorship, and thus his immunity from prosecution, was set at five years, rather than the usual one.Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#44.4 2:44.4]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#14.10 14.10], ''Crassus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#14.3 14.3], ''Pompey'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#48 48], ''Cato the Younger'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Minor*.html#33.3 33.3]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#22 22]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/38*.html#8.5 38:8.5] When his consulship ended, Caesar narrowly avoided prosecution for the irregularities of his year in office, and quickly left for his province.Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#23 23]

Caesar was still deeply in debt, but there was money to be made as a governor, whether by extortionSee Cicero's speeches against Verres for an example of a former provincial governor successfully prosecuted for illegally enriching himself at his province's expense.

Caesar is sometimes thought to have suffered from epilepsy.

Several specialists in headache medicine believe that instead of epilepsy, a more accurate diagnosis would be migraine headache.Seymour Diamond and Mary Franklin, ''Conquering Your Migraine: The Essential Guide to Understanding and Treating Migraines for all Sufferers and Their Families'', (New York: Fireside, 2001), 19.
______________________________
In 2003, psychiatrist Harbour F. Hodder published what he termed as the "Caesar Complex" theory, arguing that Caesar was a sufferer of temporal lobe epilepsy and the debilitating symptoms of the condition were a factor in Caesar's conscious decision to forgo personal safety in the days leading up to his assassination.

By covering his ear, Alexander indicated that he had turned his attention from an accusation in order to hear the defence.Plutarch, ''Alexander'' 42; Jeremy Paterson discussing Caesar's health in general in "Caesar the Man," ''A Companion to Julius Caesar'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2009), p. 130 [https://books.google.com/books?id=gzOXLGbIIYwC&pg=PT150&dq=julius+caesar+deaf&hl=en&ei=zPtSTO-xFYaDngfwjbHvAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=julius%20caesar%20deaf&f=false online.]

* Marcus Junius Brutus (born 85 BC): The historian Plutarch notes that Caesar believed Brutus to have been his illegitimate son, as his mother Servilia had been Caesar's lover during their youth.Plutarch, ''Brutus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Brutus*.html#5 5] Caesar would have been 15 years old when Brutus was born.

{{ISBN|978-0-19-214231-3}} known by his cognomen '''Julius Caesar''', was a Roman politician and military general who played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire.
______________________________
Upon crossing the Rubicon, Caesar, according to Plutarch and Suetonius, is supposed to have quoted the Athenian playwright Menander, in Greek, "the die is cast".Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#32.8 32.8] Erasmus, however, notes that the more accurate Latin translation of the Greek imperative mood would be "''alea iacta esto''", '''let''' the die be cast.
______________________________
It has no basis in historical fact and Shakespeare's use of Latin here is not from any assertion that Caesar would have been using the language, rather than the Greek reported by Suetonius, but because the phrase was already popular when the play was written, as it appears in Richard Edes's Latin play ''Caesar Interfectus'' of 1582 and ''The True Tragedie of Richarde Duke of Yorke & etc.''
