==Legacy==

thumb|upright|A [[Ronald Reagan (Fagan)|bronze statue of Reagan standing in the Capitol rotunda (a part of the National Statuary Hall Collection)]]
Since Reagan left office in 1989, substantial debate has occurred among scholars, historians, and the general public surrounding his legacy.Andrew L. Johns, ed., ''A Companion to Ronald Reagan'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2015).
______________________________
Supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of Reagan's economic policies,Hayward, pp.635638 foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold War,Beschloss, p. 324 and a restoration of American pride and morale.
______________________________
Edwin Feulner, president of The Heritage Foundation, said that Reagan "helped create a safer, freer world" and said of his economic policies: "He took an America suffering from 'malaise'... and made its citizens believe again in their destiny."
______________________________
Since he left office, historians have reached a consensus, as summarized by British historian M. J. Heale, who finds that scholars now concur that Reagan rehabilitated conservatism, turned the nation to the right, practiced a considerably pragmatic conservatism that balanced ideology and the constraints of politics, revived faith in the presidency and in American exceptionalism, and contributed to victory in the Cold War.Heale, M.J. in Cheryl Hudson and Gareth Davies, eds.
______________________________
Reagan's aggressive rhetoric toward the USSR had mixed effects; Jeffery W. Knopf observes that being labeled "evil" probably made no difference to the Soviets but gave encouragement to the East-European citizens opposed to communism.
______________________________
This time period emphasized that the conservative "Reagan Revolution," led by Reagan, had a permanent impact on the United States in domestic and foreign policy.
______________________________
Reagan never left the United States during the war, but he kept a film reel that he obtained while he was in the service.
______________________________
The reel depicted the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp; he believed that doubts would someday arise as to whether the Holocaust had occurred.Cannon, Lou (1991), pp.486490 It has been alleged that he was overheard telling Israeli foreign minister Yitzhak Shamir in 1983 that he had filmed that footage himself and helped liberate Auschwitz,Schaller, M., ''Reckoning with Reagan'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 9 though this purported conversation was disputed by Secretary of State George P. Shultz.Shultz, George (1993).
______________________________
In 1989, Reagan was made an Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, one of the highest British orders (this entitled him to the use of the post-nominal letters "GCB" but, as a foreign national, not to be known as "Sir Ronald Reagan"); only two U.S. presidents have received this honor since attaining office, Reagan and George H. W. Bush, while Dwight D. Eisenhower received his before becoming President in his capacity as a general after World War II.
