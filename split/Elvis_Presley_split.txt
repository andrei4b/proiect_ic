{{sfn|Szatmary|1996|p=35}} By the time he graduated from high school in June 1953, Presley had already singled out music as his future.

Phillips, meanwhile, was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused.
______________________________
He was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist Winfield "Scotty" Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, to work something up with Presley for a recording session.
______________________________
As they were about to give up and go home, Presley took his guitar and launched into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's "That's All Right".
______________________________
Moore recalled, "All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them.

{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=9497}} Three days later, popular Memphis DJ Dewey Phillips played "That's All Right" on his ''Red, Hot, and Blue'' show.

The trio played publicly for the first time on July 17 at the Bon Air clubPresley still sporting his child-size guitar.
______________________________
A combination of his strong response to rhythm and nervousness at playing before a large crowd led Presley to shake his legs as he performed: his wide-cut pants emphasized his movements, causing young women in the audience to start screaming.
______________________________
{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=106, 10811}} Moore recalled, "During the instrumental parts, he would back off from the mike and be playing and shaking, and the crowd would just go wild".
______________________________
{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=110}}
Soon after, Moore and Black quit their old band, the Starlite Wranglers, to play with Presley regularly, and DJ and promoter Bob Neal became the trio's manager.
______________________________
From August through October, they played frequently at the Eagle's Nest club and returned to Sun Studio for more recording sessions,{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=11727, 131}} and Presley quickly grew more confident on stage.
______________________________
{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=12728, 13542}} House drummer D. J. Fontana brought a new element, complementing Presley's movements with accented beats that he had mastered playing in strip clubs.
______________________________
Trading in his old guitar for $8 (and seeing it promptly dispatched to the garbage), he purchased a Martin instrument for $175, and his trio began playing in new locales including Houston, Texas, and Texarkana, Arkansas.
______________________________
In January, Neal signed a formal management contract with Presley and brought the singer to the attention of Colonel Tom Parker, whom he considered the best promoter in the music business.
______________________________
Some of the songs, like "That's All Right", were in what one Memphis journalist described as the "R&B idiom of negro field jazz"; others, like "Blue Moon of Kentucky", were "more in the country field", "but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both".
______________________________
{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=163}} This blend of styles made it difficult for Presley's music to find radio airplay.
______________________________
According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because he sounded too much like a black artist and none of the rhythm-and-blues stations would touch him because "he sounded too much like a hillbilly.
______________________________
In mid-October, they played a few shows in support of Bill Haley, whose "Rock Around the Clock" had been a number-one hit the previous year.

{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=35, 51, 57, 61, 75}} (Parker, however, failed to register Presley with such musical licensing firms as ASCAP and/or its rival BMI, which eventually denied Presley annuity from songwriter's royalties.)
______________________________
He received credit on two other songs to which he did contribute: he provided the title for "That's Someone You Never Forget" (1961), written by his friend and former Humes schoolmate Red West; Presley and West collaborated with another friend, guitarist Charlie Hodge, on "You'll Be Gone" (1962).

On January 10, 1956, Presley made his first recordings for RCA in Nashville.
______________________________
{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=30}} Extending the singer's by now customary backup of Moore, Black, and Fontana, RCA enlisted pianist Floyd Cramer, guitarist Chet Atkins, and three background singers, including Gordon Stoker of the popular Jordanaires quartet, to fill out the sound.
______________________________
He not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar, not piano, the lead instrument in all three cases.
______________________________
{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=30}} While Presley was not an innovative guitarist like Moore or contemporary African American rockers Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry, cultural historian Gilbert B. Rodman argues that the album's cover image, "of Elvis having the time of his life on stage ''with a guitar in his hands'' played a crucial role in positioning the guitar... as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new music.
______________________________
Berle persuaded the singer to leave his guitar backstage, advising, "Let 'em see you, son.
______________________________
"{{sfn|Gould|1956}} Ben Gross of the New York ''Daily News'' opined that popular music "has reached its lowest depths in the 'grunt and groin' antics of one Elvis Presley.... Elvis, who rotates his pelvis... gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar, tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and bordellos".
______________________________
I don't see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when it's only music....

I mean, how would rock 'n' roll music make anyone rebel against their parents?

The album includes "Old Shep", which he sang at the talent show in 1945, and which now marked the first time he played piano on an RCA session.
______________________________
"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=335}} Assessing the musical and cultural impact of Presley's recordings from "That's All Right" through ''Elvis'', rock critic Dave Marsh wrote that "these records, more than any others, contain the seeds of what rock & roll was, has been and most likely what it may foreseeably become.
______________________________
To further take advantage of Presley's popularity, four musical numbers were added to what was originally a straight acting role.
______________________________
The results, none officially released for 25 years, became known as the "Million Dollar Quartet" recordingsJohnny Cash was long thought to have played as well, but was present just briefly at Phillips's instigation for a photo opportunity.
______________________________
{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=37}} In his first full year at RCA, one of the music industry's largest companies, Presley had accounted for over 50 percent of the label's singles sales.

From the make-up over his eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing Rudolph Valentino in ''The Sheik'', with all stops out.

Already an international star, he was attracting fans even where his music was not officially released.
______________________________
Under the headline "Presley Records a Craze in Soviet", ''The New York Times'' reported that pressings of his music on discarded X-ray plates were commanding high prices in Leningrad.

In Special Services, he would have been able to give musical performances and remain in touch with the public, but Parker had convinced him that to gain popular respect, he should serve his country as a regular soldier.
______________________________
The album features several songs described by Greil Marcus as full of Chicago blues "menace, driven by Presley's own super-miked acoustic guitar, brilliant playing by Scotty Moore, and demonic sax work from Boots Randolph.
______________________________
"{{sfn|Marcus|1982|pp=27980}} As a whole, the record "conjured up the vision of a performer who could be all things", in the words of music historian John Robertson: "a flirtatious teenage idol with a heart of gold; a tempestuous, dangerous lover; a gutbucket blues singer; a sophisticated nightclub entertainer; [a] raucous rocker".
______________________________
{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=148}} As described by John Robertson, it exemplifies the Nashville sound, the restrained, cosmopolitan style that would define country music in the 1960s.

===Influences===
Presley's earliest musical influence came from gospel.
______________________________
"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=14}} In Memphis, Presley frequently attended all-night gospel singings at the Ellis Auditorium, where groups such as the Statesmen Quartet led the music in a style that, Guralnick suggests, sowed the seeds of Presley's future stage act:
{{blockquote|The Statesmen were an electric combination... featuring some of the most thrillingly emotive singing and daringly unconventional showmanship in the entertainment world... dressed in suits that might have come out of the window of Lansky's.... Bass singer Jim Wetherington, known universally as the Big Chief, maintained a steady bottom, ceaselessly jiggling first his left leg, then his right, with the material of the pants leg ballooning out and shimmering.

"He went about as far as you could go in gospel music," said Jake Hess.

As a teenager, Presley's musical interests were wide-ranging, and he was deeply informed about African American musical idioms as well as white ones (see "Teenage life in Memphis").
______________________________
Though he never had any formal training, he was blessed with a remarkable memory, and his musical knowledge was already considerable by the time he made his first professional recordings in 1954 at the age of 19.
______________________________
When Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller met him two years later, they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the blues,{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=211}} and, as Stoller put it, "He certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music.

Presley was a central figure in the development of rockabilly, according to music historians.
______________________________
{{sfn|Morrison|1996|p=x}} Paul Friedlander describes the defining elements of rockabilly, which he similarly characterizes as "essentially... an Elvis Presley construction": "the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [of] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [of] country".
______________________________
{{sfn|Friedlander|1996|p=45}} In "That's All Right", the Presley trio's first record, Scotty Moore's guitar solo, "a combination of Merle Travisstyle country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie, and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, is a microcosm of this fusion.

At RCA, Presley's rock and roll sound grew distinct from rockabilly with group chorus vocals, more heavily amplified electric guitars{{sfn|Gillett|2000|p=113}} and a tougher, more intense manner.

Jorgensen calls the 1966 recording of "How Great Thou Art" "an extraordinary fulfillment of his vocal ambitions", as Presley "crafted for himself an ad-hoc arrangement in which he took every part of the four-part vocal, from [the] bass intro to the soaring heights of the song's operatic climax", becoming "a kind of one-man quartet".
______________________________
{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}}  Scholar Lindsay Waters, who figures Presley's range as two-and-a-quarter octaves, emphasizes that "his voice had an emotional range from tender whispers to sighs down to shouts, grunts, grumbles, and sheer gruffness that could move the listener from calmness and surrender, to fear.

===Racial issues===
When Dewey Phillips first aired "That's All Right" on Memphis's WHBQ, many listeners who contacted the station by phone and telegram to ask for it again assumed that its singer was black.
______________________________
{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=1001}} From the beginning of his national fame, Presley expressed respect for African American performers and their music, and disregard for the norms of segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South.
______________________________
Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician Arthur Crudupthe originator of "That's All Right""bang his box the way I do now, and I said if I ever got to the place where I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw.

The persistence of such attitudes was fueled by resentment over the fact that Presley, whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to African American sources, achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers.

{{Sfn|Dyer|195960|p=30}} Brett Farmer places the "orgasmic gyrations" of the title dance sequence in ''Jailhouse Rock'' within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a "spectacular eroticization, if not homoeroticization, of the male image".

Therefore, Frank Coffey is of the opinion that a plausible cause of Elvis' death is "a phenomenon called the Valsalva maneuver (essentially straining on the toilet leading to heart stoppageplausible because Elvis suffered constipation, a common reaction to drug use)..."Frank Coffey, ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Elvis'' (New York: Alpha Books 1997), p. 247.

{{sfn|Nash|2003|p=187}} After Presley's death, it was revealed that Parker was born Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk in the Netherlands; having immigrated illegally to the U.S., he had reason to fear that if he left the country, he would not be allowed back in again.

"{{sfn|Harris|2006}} Tony Brown, who played piano for Presley regularly in the last two years of the singer's life, observed his rapidly declining health and the urgent need to address it: "But we all knew it was hopeless because Elvis was surrounded by that little circle of people... all those so-called friends".

Presley, who received no formal music training and could not read music, studied and played by ear.
______________________________
{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=51}} He certainly listened to the regional radio stations, such as WDIA-AM, that played "race records": spirituals, blues, and the modern, backbeat-heavy sound of rhythm and blues.
______________________________
{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=80}} His friend Ronnie Smith, after playing a few local gigs with him, suggested he contact Eddie Bond, leader of Smith's professional band, which had an opening for a vocalist.
______________________________
He was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist Winfield "Scotty" Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, to work something up with Presley for a recording session.
______________________________
Moore recalled, "All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them.

{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=9497}} Three days later, popular Memphis DJ Dewey Phillips played "That's All Right" on his ''Red, Hot, and Blue'' show.

====Early live performances and signing with RCA====
The trio played publicly for the first time on July 17 at the Bon Air clubPresley still sporting his child-size guitar.
______________________________
A combination of his strong response to rhythm and nervousness at playing before a large crowd led Presley to shake his legs as he performed: his wide-cut pants emphasized his movements, causing young women in the audience to start screaming.
______________________________
{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=106, 10811}} Moore recalled, "During the instrumental parts, he would back off from the mike and be playing and shaking, and the crowd would just go wild".

{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=110}}
Soon after, Moore and Black quit their old band, the Starlite Wranglers, to play with Presley regularly, and DJ and promoter Bob Neal became the trio's manager.
______________________________
From August through October, they played frequently at the Eagle's Nest club and returned to Sun Studio for more recording sessions,{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=11727, 131}} and Presley quickly grew more confident on stage.
______________________________
{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=12728, 13542}} House drummer D. J. Fontana brought a new element, complementing Presley's movements with accented beats that he had mastered playing in strip clubs.
______________________________
Trading in his old guitar for $8 (and seeing it promptly dispatched to the garbage), he purchased a Martin instrument for $175, and his trio began playing in new locales including Houston, Texas, and Texarkana, Arkansas.
______________________________
According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because he sounded too much like a black artist and none of the rhythm-and-blues stations would touch him because "he sounded too much like a hillbilly.

In mid-October, they played a few shows in support of Bill Haley, whose "Rock Around the Clock" had been a number-one hit the previous year.

{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=30}} While Presley was not an innovative guitarist like Moore or contemporary African American rockers Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry, cultural historian Gilbert B. Rodman argues that the album's cover image, "of Elvis having the time of his life on stage ''with a guitar in his hands'' played a crucial role in positioning the guitar... as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new music.

The album includes "Old Shep", which he sang at the talent show in 1945, and which now marked the first time he played piano on an RCA session.

The results, none officially released for 25 years, became known as the "Million Dollar Quartet" recordingsJohnny Cash was long thought to have played as well, but was present just briefly at Phillips's instigation for a photo opportunity.

From the make-up over his eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing Rudolph Valentino in ''The Sheik'', with all stops out.

It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons....

The album features several songs described by Greil Marcus as full of Chicago blues "menace, driven by Presley's own super-miked acoustic guitar, brilliant playing by Scotty Moore, and demonic sax work from Boots Randolph.

The live segments saw Presley clad in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days.

"{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=26}} Binder said of Presley's reaction, "I played Elvis the 60-minute show, and he told me in the screening room, 'Steve, it's the greatest thing I've ever done in my life.

"{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=39}} The next day, Parker's negotiations with the hotel resulted in a five-year contract for Presley to play each February and August, at an annual salary of $1 million.

{{'"}}{{sfn|Hopkins|1986|p=136}} Presley continued to play to sellout crowds.

Asked if drugs were involved, he declared that "drugs played no role in Presley's death".
______________________________
Dr. Francisco had offered a cause of death before the autopsy was complete; claimed the underlying ailment was cardiac arrhythmia, a condition that can be determined only in someone who is still alive; and denied drugs played any part in Presley's death before the toxicology results were known.

Carl Perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around Jackson, and I know for a fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old.

Jorgensen calls the 1966 recording of "How Great Thou Art" "an extraordinary fulfillment of his vocal ambitions", as Presley "crafted for himself an ad-hoc arrangement in which he took every part of the four-part vocal, from [the] bass intro to the soaring heights of the song's operatic climax", becoming "a kind of one-man quartet".

I'll probably start out here in this country and after that, play some concerts abroad, probably starting in Europe.

"{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=215}} Rumors that he would play overseas for the first time were fueled in 1974 by a million-dollar bid for an Australian tour.

{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=56365}} In each case, any ambitions the singer may have had to play such parts were thwarted by his manager's negotiating demands or flat refusals.

{{sfn|Mawer|2007b}} (2) Before late 1958, rather than unified pop and country singles charts, ''Billboard'' had as many as four charts for each, separately ranking records according to sales, jukebox play, jockey spins (i.e., airplay), and, in the case of pop, a general Top 100.

Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42.
