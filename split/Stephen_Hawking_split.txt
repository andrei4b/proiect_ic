' brother' ' sister' ' youngest' ' oldest' ' child' ' sibling' 
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=21}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=6}} Hawking had two younger sisters, Philippa and Mary, and an adopted brother, Edward Frank David (19552003).
______________________________
At the time, he was one of the youngest scientists to become a Fellow.
______________________________
{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=xxix}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=114}}{{London Gazette |issue=48837 |date=30 December 1981 |page=8 |supp=y}} These awards did not significantly change Hawking's financial status, and motivated by the need to finance his children's education and home expenses, he decided in 1982 to write a popular book about the universe that would be accessible to the general public.
______________________________
Hawking quickly conceded that he had lost his bet and said that Higgs should win the Nobel Prize for Physics, which he did in 2013.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages ===
When Hawking was a graduate student at Cambridge, his relationship with Jane Wilde, a friend of his sister whom he had met shortly before his late 1963 diagnosis with motor neurone disease, continued to develop.
______________________________
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=65}} A third child, Timothy, was born in April 1979.
______________________________
In 2006, Hawking and Mason quietly divorced,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=225}} and Hawking resumed closer relationships with Jane, his children, and his grandchildren.

______NATIONALITY______
' born' ' lived' ' left' ' moved' ' migrate' ' migration' ' citizen' ' travel' ' jew' ' ethnic' ' foreign' 
== Early life and education ==
=== Family ===
Hawking was born on 8 January 1942 in Oxford to Frank (19051986) and Isobel Eileen Hawking (ne Walker; 19152013).
______________________________
{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=xiii, 2}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=21}} Hawking's mother was born into a family of doctors in Glasgow, Scotland.
______________________________
{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=2, 5}}

In 1950, when Hawking's father became head of the division of parasitology at the National Institute for Medical Research, the family moved to St Albans, Hertfordshire.
______________________________
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=22}} They lived a frugal existence in a large, cluttered, and poorly maintained house and travelled in a converted London taxicab.
______________________________
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=68}}

Beginning in 1973, Hawking moved into the study of quantum gravity and quantum mechanics.
______________________________
One cannot travel north of the North Pole, but there is no boundary there{{snd}}it is simply the point where all north-running lines meet and end.{{sfn|Baird|2007|loc=p.
______________________________
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=14546}} Hawking travelled extensively to promote his work, and enjoyed partying and dancing into the small hours.
______________________________
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=14344}} A difficulty refusing the invitations and visitors left him limited time for work and his students.
______________________________
Hawking continued to travel widely, including trips to Chile, Easter Island, South Africa, Spain (to receive the Fonseca Prize in 2008),{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=233}} Canada,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=239}} and numerous trips to the United States.
______________________________
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=269}} For practical reasons related to his disability, Hawking increasingly travelled by private jet, and by 2011 that had become his only mode of international travel.
______________________________
On 28 June 2009, as a tongue-in-cheek test of his 1992 conjecture that travel into the past is effectively impossible, Hawking held a party open to all, complete with hors d'oeuvres and iced champagne, but publicised the party only after it was over so that only time-travellers would know to attend; as expected, nobody showed up to the party.
______________________________
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=4344}}

During their first years of marriage, Jane lived in London during the week as she completed her degree, and they travelled to the United States several times for conferences and physics-related visits.
______________________________
Jane began a PhD programme, and a son, Robert, was born in May 1967.
______________________________
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=4547}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=9298}} A daughter, Lucy, was born in 1970.
______________________________
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=65}} A third child, Timothy, was born in April 1979.
______________________________
Hawking accepted, and Bernard Carr travelled with them as the first of many students who fulfilled this role.
______________________________
=== Plans for a trip to space ===
alt=Hawking, without his wheelchair, floating weightless in the air inside a plane|thumb|upright=1.15|Hawking taking a zero-gravity flight in a reduced-gravity aircraft, 2007
In late 2006, Hawking revealed in a BBC interview that one of his greatest unfulfilled desires was to travel to space; on hearing this, Richard Branson offered a free flight into space with Virgin Galactic, which Hawking immediately accepted.
______________________________
Hawking was born on the 300th anniversary of Galileo's death and died on the 139th anniversary of Einstein's birth.
______________________________

______MULTILINGUAL______
' multilingual' ' language' ' speak' ' foreign' 
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=137}} Peter Guzzardi, his editor at Bantam, pushed him to explain his ideas clearly in non-technical language, a process that required many revisions from an increasingly irritated Hawking.
______________________________
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=143}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=24345}} The book was translated into many languages,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=14344}} and ultimately sold an estimated 9{{nbsp}}million copies.
______________________________
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=139}}

For his communication, Hawking initially raised his eyebrows to choose letters on a spelling card,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=136}} but in 1986 he received a computer program called the "Equalizer" from Walter Woltosz, CEO of Words Plus, who had developed an earlier version of the software to help his mother-in-law, who also suffered from ALS and had lost her ability to speak and write.
______________________________
In September 2014, he joined the Starmus Festival as keynote speaker and declared himself an atheist.

______________________________
The family placed a high value on education.
______________________________
His family could not afford the school fees without the financial aid of a scholarship, so Hawking remained at St Albans.
______________________________
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=26}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=1920}}

Although known at school as "Einstein", Hawking was not initially successful academically.
______________________________
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=2728}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=4243}}

=== Undergraduate years ===
Hawking began his university education at University College, Oxford, in October 1959 at the age of 17.
______________________________
So, when asked at the oral{{clarify|It is unclear to those unfamiliar with the UK educational system whether these are Oxford examiners, Cambridge, or 3rd parties|date=March 2018}} to describe his plans, he said, "If you award me a First, I will go to Cambridge.
______________________________
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=9394}} His promotion coincided with a health crisis which led to his accepting, albeit reluctantly, some nursing services at home.
______________________________
As Hawking explained, "If the universe has no boundaries but is self-contained... then God would not have had any freedom to choose how the universe began.
______________________________
{{sfn|Larsen|2005|pp=xxix}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=114}}{{London Gazette |issue=48837 |date=30 December 1981 |page=8 |supp=y}} These awards did not significantly change Hawking's financial status, and motivated by the need to finance his children's education and home expenses, he decided in 1982 to write a popular book about the universe that would be accessible to the general public.
______________________________
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=3739, 77}} His disabilities meant that the responsibilities of home and family rested firmly on his wife's increasingly overwhelmed shoulders, leaving him more time to think about physics.
______________________________
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=8388}}

Hawking returned to Cambridge in 1975 to a new home and a new job, as reader.
______________________________
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p = 145}} Hawking told Jane that he was leaving her for Mason,{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p = 165}} and departed the family home in February 1990.
______________________________
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=32}} The problems worsened, and his speech became slightly slurred and his family noticed the changes when he returned home for Christmas, and medical investigations were begun.
______________________________
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=13536}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=23236}} The National Health Service was ready to pay for a nursing home, but Jane was determined that he would live at home.
______________________________
== Death ==
Hawking died at his home in Cambridge, England, early in the morning of 14 March 2018, at the age of 76.
______________________________
At the release party for the home video version of the ''A Brief History of Time'', Leonard Nimoy, who had played Spock on ''Star Trek'', learned that Hawking was interested in appearing on the show.
______________________________

______SCHOOL______
' teach' ' authorit' ' class' 
{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|pp=1416}} From 1958 on, with the help of the mathematics teacher Dikran Tahta, they built a computer from clock parts, an old telephone switchboard and other recycled components.
______________________________
He developed into a popular, lively and witty college member, interested in classical music and science fiction.
______________________________
The initial singularity of the classical Big Bang models was replaced with a region akin to the North Pole.
______________________________
He stated: "There is a fundamental difference between religion, which is based on authority, [and] science, which is based on observation and reason.

He developed into a popular, lively and witty college member, interested in classical music and science fiction.
______________________________
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=28}} Part of the transformation resulted from his decision to join the college boat club, the University College Boat Club, where he coxed a rowing crew.{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=3031}}{{sfn|Hawking|1992|loc=p.
______________________________
There were other positive developments: Hawking received a research fellowship at Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge;{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=4344}} he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology, in March 1966;{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=47}} and his essay "Singularities and the Geometry of Space-Time" shared top honours with one by Penrose to win that year's prestigious Adams Prize.
______________________________
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|pp=23738}}

During his career, Hawking supervised 39 successful PhD students.
______________________________
One doctoral student did not successfully complete the PhD.
______________________________
Jane began a PhD programme, and a son, Robert, was born in May 1967.
______________________________

______READING______
' read' ' books' 
Despite their families' financial constraints, both parents attended the University of Oxford, where Frank read medicine and Isobel read Philosophy, Politics and Economics.
______________________________
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=22}}{{sfn|Larsen|2005|p=xiii}} In St Albans, the family was considered highly intelligent and somewhat eccentric;{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=22}}{{sfn|White|Gribbin|2002|p=12}} meals were often spent with each person silently reading a book.
______________________________
He later blamed its "progressive methods" for his failure to learn to read while at the school.
______________________________
{{sfn|Ferguson|2011|p=25}} With time, he began to show considerable aptitude for scientific subjects and, inspired by Tahta, decided to read mathematics at university.
______________________________
As it was not possible to read mathematics there at the time, Hawking decided to study physics and chemistry.
