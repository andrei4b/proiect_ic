=== Lessons learned ===
Washington never gained the commission in the British army that he yearned for, but in these years he acquired military, political, and leadership skills that proved invaluable during the Revolution,{{sfn|Chernow|2010|pp=9193}} aided by his observations, readings, and conversations with professional officers.

After five years of suffering from epileptic attacks, step-daughter Patsy Custis died peacefully in Washington's arms on June 19, 1773.
______________________________
"{{sfn|Alden|1993|p=101}} In July 1774, he chaired a committee which adopted the "Fairfax Resolves" calling for a Continental Congress, among other things.
______________________________
He unsuccessfully lobbied anti-federalist Patrick Henry, saying that "the adoption of it under the present circumstances of the Union is in my opinion desirable;" he declared that the only alternative would be anarchy.
______________________________
Nevertheless, he did not consider it appropriate to cast his vote in favor of adoption for Virginia, since he was expected to be nominated president under it.
______________________________
Washington's most pressing foreign problem, at the start of his presidency, was the British occupation of forts on the American western frontier.
______________________________
The younger slaves were to be taught to read and write, and find suitable occupations.
______________________________
With Martha calmly composed at the foot of his bed, Washington died peacefully without further struggle five hours later at home around 10p.m.
______________________________
The service was restricted mostly to family, friends, and neighbors.

=== Subsequent diagnoses ===
The diagnosis of Washington's final illness and the immediate cause of his death have been subjects of debate since the day he died.
______________________________
{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1pp=806-10|Felisati|2005|2pp=5558}} Various modern medical authors have speculated that Washington probably died from a severe case of epiglottitis complicated by the given treatments (all of which were accepted medical practice in Washington's day), most notably the massive deliberate blood loss, which almost certainly caused hypovolemic shock.
______________________________
{{efn|At least three modern medical authors (Wallenborn 1999{{sfn|Wallenborn|1999}}, Shapiro 1975, Scheidemandel 1976) concluded that Washington most probably died from acute bacterial epiglottitis complicated by the administered treatments.
