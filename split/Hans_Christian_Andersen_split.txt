{{Quote box |width=25em |quote="It doesn't matter about being born in a duckyard, as long as you are hatched from a swan's egg"|source="The Ugly Duckling"}}
Hans Christian Andersen was born in Odense, Denmark on 2 April 1805.

At fourteen, he moved to Copenhagen to seek employment as an actor.
______________________________
At one school, he lived at his schoolmaster's home, where he was abused, being told that it was "to improve his character".
______________________________
Although he made little progress writing and publishing immediately thereafter, in 1833 he received a small travel grant from the king, thus enabling him to set out on the first of many journeys through Europe.
______________________________
Andersen's travels in Italy were to be reflected in his first novel, a fictionalized autobiography titled ''The Improvisatore'' ({{lang|da|Improvisatoren}}), published in 1835 to instant acclaim.
______________________________
===Travelogues===
In 1851, he published to wide acclaim ''In Sweden'', a volume of travel sketches.
______________________________
A keen traveller, Andersen published several other long travelogues: ''Shadow Pictures of a Journey to the Harz, Swiss Saxony, etc.
______________________________
In his travelogues, Andersen took heed of some of the contemporary conventions about travel writing, but always developed the genre to suit his own purposes.
______________________________
Each of his travelogues combines documentary and descriptive accounts of the sights he saw with more philosophical passages on topics such as being an author, immortality, and the nature of fiction in the literary travel report.
______________________________
Some of the travelogues, such as ''In Sweden'', even contain fairy-tales.
______________________________
Between 1845 and 1864, H. C. Andersen lived at 67 Nyhavn, Copenhagen, where a memorial plaque now stands.
______________________________
However in 1914 the stone was moved to another cemetery (today known as ''"Frederiksbergs ldre kirkegaard"''), where younger Collin family members were buried.
