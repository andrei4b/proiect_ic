______________________________
Her brother also became a lawyer and another member of the Supreme Court.
______________________________
At the age of 40, when her children became independent and began their separate lives, Murphy began to actively organize women's groups where the isolated housewives could meet and discuss ideas and plan group projects.
______________________________
Her strong interest in the rights and protection of women and children intensified when she was made aware of an unjust experience of an Albertan woman whose husband sold the family farm; the husband then abandoned his wife and children who were left homeless and penniless.
______________________________
In one passage, for example, she chastises whites who use the Chinese as "scapegoats", |p=233 |access-date=24 July 2015}} while elsewhere, she refers to the Chinese man as a "visitor" in this country, and that "it might be wise to put him out" if it turns out that this visitor carries "poisoned lollipops in his pocket and feeds them to our children".
______________________________
In a petition, she wrote that mentally defective children were "a menace to society and an enormous cost to the state... science is proving that mental defectiveness is a transmittable hereditary condition".
______________________________
She called it "a neglect amounting to a crime to permit these two women to go on bearing children".

______SCHOOL______

' read' ' books' 
In Canada's Senate Chamber, the five women are honoured with a plaque that reads, "To further the cause of womankind these five outstanding pioneer women caused steps to be taken resulting in the recognition by the Privy Council of women as persons eligible for appointment to the Senate of Canada."
______________________________
Although Murphy's anti-drug screeds were widely read and helped spread the drug panic across Canada, she was not respected by the Division of Narcotic Control because of the creative liberties she took in presenting research they had assisted her with.
______________________________
On the other hand, she may have deliberately tried to distance herself from those prejudices, especially the ones propagated by the more vulgar and hysterical Asian exclusionists in British Columbia in order to maximize her own credibility and sway her more moderate readers.

===Drugs and race===
thumb|200px|The cover of Murphy's 1922 book ''The Black Candle''
Although Murphy's views on race changed over the course of her life, the perspective contained in her book ''The Black Candle'' is considered the most consequential because it played a role in creating a widespread "war on drugs mentality" leading to legislation that "defined addiction as a law enforcement problem".
______________________________
This motivation may have influenced her racial analysis by playing to the popular prejudices of her white audiences.

______PERSONALITY______

The women were known as the Famous Five and were considered leaders in education for social reform and women's rights.
______________________________
===Eugenics movement===
During the early twentieth century, scientific knowledge emerged in the forefront of social importance.
______________________________
Advances in science and technology  were thought to hold answers to current and future social problems.
______________________________
Her solution to these social issues was eugenics.
______________________________
She believed that the mentally and socially inferior reproduced more than the "human thoroughbreds" and appealed to the Alberta Legislative Assembly for forced sterilization.
______________________________

______HEALTH ISSUES______
' health' ' depression' ' suffer' ' hospital' ' drug' ' medicine' ' ill' ' recover' 
However, there has been some criticism of her later work, mainly for her role in the Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta and her allegations that a ring of immigrants from other countries, particularly China, would corrupt the white race by getting Canadians hooked on drugs.

______________________________
Using extensive anecdotes and "expert" opinion, ''The Black Candle'' depicts an alarming picture of drug abuse in Canada, detailing Murphy's understanding of the use and effects of opium, cocaine, and pharmaceuticals, as well as a "new menace", "marihuana".
______________________________
|p=331 |access-date=24 July 2015}} Murphy's concern with drugs began when she started coming into "disproportionate contact with Chinese people" in her courtroom because they were over-represented in the criminal justice system.
______________________________
Vancouver at the time was in the midst of a moral panic over drugs that was part of the anti-Oriental campaign that precipitated the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923.

Canadian drug historian Catherine Carstairs has argued that Murphy's importance regarding drug policy has been "overstated".
______________________________
Although Murphy's anti-drug screeds were widely read and helped spread the drug panic across Canada, she was not respected by the Division of Narcotic Control because of the creative liberties she took in presenting research they had assisted her with.
______________________________
Carstairs also avers that Murphy did not influence the drug panic in Vancouver, but that nevertheless "her articles did mark a turning point and her book... brought the Vancouver drug panic to a larger Canadian audience".
______________________________
Race permeates ''The Black Candle'', and is intricately entwined with the drug trade and addiction in Murphy's analysis.
______________________________
Drugs victimize everyone, and members of all races perpetrate the drug trade, according to Murphy.
______________________________
Murphy's distaste for non-whites is reflected in scholarly debates, but what is not controversial is that ''The Black Candle'' was written "for the express purpose of arousing public demands for stricter drug legislation" and that in this she was to some degree successful.
______________________________
Murphy was among those who thought that societal problems like alcoholism, drug abuse and crime resulted from mental deficiencies.
______________________________
Recent memorializing of the Famous Five, such as the illustration on the back of the fifty-dollar bill, has been used as the occasion for re-evaluating Murphy's legacy.
______________________________
It has been speculated that today's drug laws are built on the racist foundations laid by Murphy and that the drug war has harmed more women than the Persons Case has benefited.
