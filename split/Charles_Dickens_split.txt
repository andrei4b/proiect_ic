Charles John Huffam Dickens was born on 7 February 1812, at 1 Mile End Terrace (now 393 Commercial Road), Landport in Portsea Island (Portsmouth), the second of eight children of Elizabeth Dickens (ne Barrow; 17891863) and John Dickens (17851851).
______________________________
In January 1815, John Dickens was called back to London, and the family moved to Norfolk Street, Fitzrovia.Charles Dickens and the Great Theatre of the World, Simon Callow, p.5 When Charles was four, they relocated to Sheerness, and thence to Chatham, Kent, where he spent his formative years until the age of 11.
______________________________
This period came to an end in June 1822, when John Dickens was recalled to Navy Pay Office headquarters at Somerset House, and the family (except for Charles, who stayed behind to finish his final term of work) moved to Camden Town in London.Simon Callow, p.13 The family had left Kent amidst rapidly mounting debts, and, living beyond his means,{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=76}}:'recklessly improvident'.
______________________________
Later, he lived in a back-attic in the house of an agent for the Insolvent Court, Archibald Russell, "a fat, good-natured, kind old gentleman... with a quiet old wife" and lame son, in Lant Street in Southwark.{{harvnb|Forster|2006|p=27}}.
______________________________
The strenuous and often harsh working conditions made a lasting impression on Dickens and later influenced his fiction and essays, becoming the foundation of his interest in the reform of socio-economic and labour conditions, the rigours of which he believed were unfairly borne by the poor.
______________________________
As he recalled to John Forster (from ''The Life of Charles Dickens''):

The blacking-warehouse was the last house on the left-hand side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs.
______________________________
When the warehouse was moved to Chandos Street in the smart, busy district of Covent Garden the boys worked in a room in which the window gave onto the street and little audiences gathered and watched them at workin Dickens biographer Simon Callow's estimation, the public display was "a new refinement added to his misery".Callow, p.25

A few months after his imprisonment, John Dickens's paternal grandmother, Elizabeth Dickens, died and bequeathed him 450.
______________________________
Under the Insolvent Debtors Act, Dickens arranged for payment of his creditors, and he and his family left Marshalsea,{{harvnb|Schlicke|1999|p=157}}.
______________________________
Righteous indignation stemming from his own situation and the conditions under which working-class people lived became major themes of his works, and it was this unhappy period in his youth to which he alluded in his favourite, and most autobiographical, novel, ''David Copperfield'':{{harvnb|Cain|2008|p=91}}.
______________________________
His favourite actor was Charles Mathews, and Dickens learnt his ''monopolylogues'', (farces in which Mathews played every character), by heart.Callow, p.34, 36 Then, having learned Gurney's system of shorthand in his spare time, he left to become a freelance reporter.

He rented rooms at Furnival's Inn and worked as a political journalist, reporting on Parliamentary debates, and he travelled across Britain to cover election campaigns for the ''Morning Chronicle''.

Born in Portsmouth, Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors' prison.

Charles John Huffam Dickens was born on 7 February 1812, at 1 Mile End Terrace (now 393 Commercial Road), Landport in Portsea Island (Portsmouth), the second of eight children of Elizabeth Dickens (ne Barrow; 17891863) and John Dickens (17851851).
______________________________
His father's brief work as a clerk in the Navy Pay Office afforded him a few years of private education, first at a dame school, and then at a school run by William Giles, a dissenter, in Chatham.{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=41}}.
______________________________
To pay for his board and to help his family, Dickens was forced to leave school and work ten-hour days at Warren's Blacking Warehouse, on Hungerford Stairs, near the present Charing Cross railway station, where he earned six shillings a week pasting labels on pots of boot blacking.
______________________________
for the home of Mrs Roylance.
______________________________
This influenced Dickens's view that a father should rule the family, and a mother find her proper sphere inside the home: "I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my being sent back".
______________________________
He did not consider it to be a good school: "Much of the haphazard, desultory teaching, poor discipline punctuated by the headmaster's sadistic brutality, the seedy ushers and general run-down atmosphere, are embodied in Mr. Creakle's Establishment in ''David Copperfield''."{{harvnb|Wilson|1972|p=61}}.
______________________________
This education was to inform works such as ''Nicholas Nickleby'', ''Dombey and Son'', and especially ''Bleak House''whose vivid portrayal of the machinations and bureaucracy of the legal system did much to enlighten the general public and served as a vehicle for dissemination of Dickens's own views regarding, particularly, the heavy burden on the poor who were forced by circumstances to "go to law".

In 1832, at age 20, Dickens was energetic and increasingly self-confident.Callow, p.48 He enjoyed mimicry and popular entertainment, lacked a clear, specific sense of what he wanted to become, and yet knew he wanted fame.

The first of their ten children, Charley, was born in January 1837, and a few months later the family set up home in Bloomsbury at 48 Doughty Street, London, (on which Charles had a three-year lease at 80 a year) from 25 March 1837 until December 1839.{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=221}}.
______________________________
The popularity he gained caused a shift in his self-perception according to critic Kate Flint, who writes that he "found himself a cultural commodity, and its circulation had passed out his control", causing him to become interested in and delve into themes of public and personal personas in the next novels.{{harvnb|Flint|2001|p=35}}.
______________________________
==Philanthropy==

Angela Burdett Coutts, heir to the Coutts banking fortune, approached Dickens in May 1846 about setting up a home for the redemption of fallen women of the working class.
______________________________
Coutts envisioned a home that would replace the punitive regimes of existing institutions with a reformative environment conducive to education and proficiency in domestic household chores.
______________________________
After initially resisting, Dickens eventually founded the home, named "Urania Cottage", in the Lime Grove section of Shepherds Bush, which he managed for ten years,{{harvnb|Nayder|2011|p=148}}.

______________________________
After further provincial readings were cancelled, he began work on his final novel, ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood''.
______________________________
After Dickens had regained sufficient strength, he arranged, with medical approval, for a final series of readings to partially make up to his sponsors what they had lost due to his illness.

Dickens worked intensively on developing arresting names for his characters that would reverberate with associations for his readers, and assist the development of motifs in the storyline, giving what one critic calls an "allegorical impetus" to the novels' meanings.
______________________________
His characters were often so memorable that they took on a life of their own outside his books.

The story of Nell Trent in ''The Old Curiosity Shop'' (1841) was received as extraordinarily moving by contemporary readers but viewed as ludicrously sentimental by Oscar Wilde.
______________________________
In ''Oliver Twist'' Dickens provides readers with an idealised portrait of a boy so inherently and unrealistically good that his values are never subverted by either brutal orphanages or coerced involvement in a gang of young pickpockets.

Such coincidences are a staple of 18th-century picaresque novels, such as Henry Fielding's ''Tom Jones,'' which Dickens enjoyed reading as a youth.{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=44}}.

Born in Portsmouth, Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors' prison.
______________________________
His father was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and was temporarily stationed in the district.
______________________________
In January 1815, John Dickens was called back to London, and the family moved to Norfolk Street, Fitzrovia.Charles Dickens and the Great Theatre of the World, Simon Callow, p.5 When Charles was four, they relocated to Sheerness, and thence to Chatham, Kent, where he spent his formative years until the age of 11.
______________________________
His father's brief work as a clerk in the Navy Pay Office afforded him a few years of private education, first at a dame school, and then at a school run by William Giles, a dissenter, in Chatham.{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=41}}.

______________________________
This period came to an end in June 1822, when John Dickens was recalled to Navy Pay Office headquarters at Somerset House, and the family (except for Charles, who stayed behind to finish his final term of work) moved to Camden Town in London.Simon Callow, p.13 The family had left Kent amidst rapidly mounting debts, and, living beyond his means,{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=76}}:'recklessly improvident'.
______________________________
Charles, then 12 years old, boarded with Elizabeth Roylance, a family friend, at 112 College Place, Camden Town.{{harvnb|Pope-Hennessy|1945|p=11}}.
______________________________
Roylance was "a reduced [impoverished] old lady, long known to our family", whom Dickens later immortalised, "with a few alterations and embellishments", as "Mrs. Pipchin" in ''Dombey and Son''.
______________________________
To pay for his board and to help his family, Dickens was forced to leave school and work ten-hour days at Warren's Blacking Warehouse, on Hungerford Stairs, near the present Charing Cross railway station, where he earned six shillings a week pasting labels on pots of boot blacking.
______________________________
When the warehouse was moved to Chandos Street in the smart, busy district of Covent Garden the boys worked in a room in which the window gave onto the street and little audiences gathered and watched them at workin Dickens biographer Simon Callow's estimation, the public display was "a new refinement added to his misery".Callow, p.25

A few months after his imprisonment, John Dickens's paternal grandmother, Elizabeth Dickens, died and bequeathed him 450.
______________________________
Under the Insolvent Debtors Act, Dickens arranged for payment of his creditors, and he and his family left Marshalsea,{{harvnb|Schlicke|1999|p=157}}.
______________________________
Charles's mother, Elizabeth Dickens, did not immediately support his removal from the boot-blacking warehouse.
______________________________
This influenced Dickens's view that a father should rule the family, and a mother find her proper sphere inside the home: "I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my being sent back".
______________________________
His mother's failure to request his return was a factor in his dissatisfied attitude towards women.{{harvnb|Wilson|1972|p=58}}.
______________________________
Maria's parents disapproved of the courtship and ended the relationship by sending her to school in Paris.{{harvnb|Davis|1998|p=23}}.
______________________________
William Barrow, a brother of his mother, offered him a job on ''The Mirror of Parliament'' and he worked in the House of Commons for the first time early in 1832.
______________________________
His journalism, in the form of sketches in periodicals, formed his first collection of pieces, published in 1836: ''Sketches by Boz''Boz being a family nickname he employed as a pseudonym for some years.
______________________________
Dickens apparently adopted it from the nickname "Moses", which he had given to his youngest brother Augustus Dickens, after a character in Oliver Goldsmith's ''The Vicar of Wakefield''.
______________________________
Hogarth invited Dickens to contribute ''Street Sketches'' and Dickens became a regular visitor to his Fulham house, excited by Hogarth's friendship with a hero of his, Walter Scott, and enjoying the company of Hogarth's three daughtersGeorgina, Mary, and nineteen-year-old Catherine.Callow p.54

Dickens made rapid progress both professionally and socially.
______________________________
The first of their ten children, Charley, was born in January 1837, and a few months later the family set up home in Bloomsbury at 48 Doughty Street, London, (on which Charles had a three-year lease at 80 a year) from 25 March 1837 until December 1839.{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=221}}.
______________________________
Dickens became very attached to Mary, and she died in his arms after a brief illness in 1837.
______________________________
At this time Georgina Hogarth, another sister of Catherine, joined the Dickens household, now living at Devonshire Terrace, Marylebone, to care for the young family they had left behind.
______________________________
He also wrote a religious work called ''The Life of Our Lord'' (1849), which was a short book about the life of Jesus Christ, written with the purpose of inculcating his faith to his children and family.Stephen Skelton, [https://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/churchandministry/Skelton_Christmas_Carol_A.aspx Reclaiming 'A Christmas Carol'].

In 1857, Dickens hired professional actresses for the play ''The Frozen Deep'', written by him and his protg, Wilkie Collins.
______________________________
That the two had a son who died in infancy was alleged by Dickens's daughter, Kate Perugini, whom Gladys Storey had interviewed before her death in 1929.
______________________________
Dickens managed to avoid an appearance at the inquest to avoid disclosing that he had been travelling with Ternan and her mother, which would have caused a scandal.
______________________________
He never regained consciousness, and the next day, five years to the day after the Staplehurst rail crash, he died at Gads Hill Place.

==Literary style==

Dickens favoured the style of the 18th-century picaresque novels that he found in abundance on his father's shelves.
______________________________
Many were drawn from real life: Mrs Nickleby is based on his mother, though she didn't recognise herself in the portrait,{{harvnb|Ziegler|2007|p=45}}.

Dickens's father was sent to prison for debt, and this became a common theme in many of his books, with the detailed depiction of life in the Marshalsea prison in ''Little Dorrit'' resulting from Dickens's own experiences of the institution.{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=}}.
______________________________
For example, Oliver Twist turns out to be the lost nephew of the upper-class family that rescues him from the dangers of the pickpocket group.

Dickens catalysed the emerging Christmas as a family-centred festival of generosity, in contrast to the dwindling community-based and church-centred observations, as new middle-class expectations arose.{{harvnb|Hutton|2001|p=188}}.

'''Charles John Huffam Dickens''' ({{IPAc-en||d||k||n|z}}; 7 February 1812 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic.
______________________________
Despite his lack of formal education, he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed readings extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, education, and other social reforms.
______________________________
Dickens has been praised by fellow writersfrom Leo Tolstoy to George Orwell, G. K. Chesterton and Tom Wolfe for his realism, comedy, prose style, unique characterisations, and social criticism.
______________________________
The term ''Dickensian'' is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters.
______________________________
Hogarth invited Dickens to contribute ''Street Sketches'' and Dickens became a regular visitor to his Fulham house, excited by Hogarth's friendship with a hero of his, Walter Scott, and enjoying the company of Hogarth's three daughtersGeorgina, Mary, and nineteen-year-old Catherine.Callow p.54

===Social commentary===
thumb|right|upright|Nurse Sarah Gamp (left) from ''Martin Chuzzlewit'' became a stereotype of untrained and incompetent nurses of the early Victorian era, before the reforms of Florence Nightingale
Dickens's novels were, among other things, works of social commentary.
______________________________
He was a fierce critic of the poverty and social stratification of Victorian society.
______________________________
===Literary techniques===

Dickens is often described as using idealised characters and highly sentimental scenes to contrast with his caricatures and the ugly social truths he reveals.
______________________________
While later novels also centre on idealised characters (Esther Summerson in ''Bleak House'' and Amy Dorrit in ''Little Dorrit''), this idealism serves only to highlight Dickens's goal of poignant social commentary.
______________________________
In this work, he uses vitriol and satire to illustrate how this marginalised social stratum was termed "Hands" by the factory owners; that is, not really "people" but rather only appendages of the machines they operated.
______________________________
Karl Marx asserted that Dickens "issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians, publicists and moralists put together".{{harvnb|Kucich|Sadoff|2006|p=155}}.
______________________________
The exceptional popularity of Dickens's novels, even those with socially oppositional themes (''Bleak House'', 1853; ''Little Dorrit'', 1857; ''Our Mutual Friend'', 1865), not only underscored his almost preternatural ability to create compelling storylines and unforgettable characters, but also ensured that the Victorian public confronted issues of social justice that had commonly been ignored.

All these became his friends and collaborators, with the exception of Disraeli, and he met his first publisher, John Macrone, at the house.Simon Callow, Charles Dickens and the Great Theatre of the World, p.56 The success of ''Sketches by Boz'' led to a proposal from publishers Chapman and Hall for Dickens to supply text to match Robert Seymour's engraved illustrations in a monthly letterpress.
______________________________
The resulting story became ''The Pickwick Papers'', and though the first few episodes were not successful, the introduction of the Cockney character Sam Weller in the fourth episode (the first to be illustrated by Phiz) marked a sharp climb in its popularity.Simon Callow, Charles Dickens and the Great theatre of the World, p.60 The final instalment sold 40,000 copies.
______________________________
Dickens became very attached to Mary, and she died in his arms after a brief illness in 1837.

Although in grave health by this time, he read ''A Christmas Carol'' and ''The Trial from Pickwick''.
______________________________
On 2 May, he made his last public appearance at a Royal Academy Banquet in the presence of the Prince and Princess of Wales, paying a special tribute on the death of his friend, the illustrator Daniel Maclise.{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=10691070}}.

Biographer Claire Tomalin has suggested Dickens was actually in Peckham when he suffered the stroke, and his mistress Ellen Ternan and her maids had him taken back to Gad's Hill so the public would not know the truth about their relationship.omalin, Claire ''Charles Dickens: A Life'' (2011) p.395-96, p.484 Contrary to his wish to be buried at Rochester Cathedral "in an inexpensive, unostentatious, and strictly private manner",{{harvnb|Forster|2006|p=628}}.
