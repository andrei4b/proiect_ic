==Early life and education==
Brin was born in Moscow in the Soviet Union, to Russian Jewish parents, Yevgenia and Mikhail Brin, both graduates of Moscow State University (MSU).

The Brin family lived in a three-room apartment in central Moscow, which they also shared with Sergey's paternal grandmother.
______________________________
In "The Story of Sergey Brin", Brin told Mark Malseed of ''Moment'' magazine, "I've known for a long time that my father wasn't able to pursue the career he wanted", but Brin only picked up the details years later after they had settled in the United States.
______________________________
In 1977, after his father returned from a mathematics conference in Warsaw, Poland, Mikhail Brin announced that it was time for the family to emigrate.
______________________________
"We cannot stay here any more", he told his wife and mother.
______________________________
He added, "I was the only one in the family who decided it was really important to leave."
______________________________
Sergey's mother was less willing to leave their home in Moscow, where they had spent their entire lives.
______________________________
They formally applied for their exit visa in September 1978, and as a result his father was "promptly fired".
______________________________
For related reasons, his mother had to leave her job.
______________________________
During this time his parents shared responsibility for looking after him and his father taught himself computer programming.
______________________________
At an interview in October 2000, Brin said, "I know the hard times that my parents went through there and am very thankful that I was brought to the States.

''Google: Corporations That Changed the World'', Greenwood Publishing Group (2008) In 2017, Brin later recalled: "I came here to the US at age six with my family from the Soviet Union, which was at that time the greatest enemy the US had...

And even then the US had the courage to take me and my family in as refugees."

In the summer of 1990, a few weeks before his 17th birthday, his father led a group of high school math students, including Sergey, on a two-week exchange program to the Soviet Union.

Malseed adds, "On the second day of the trip, while the group toured a sanatorium in the countryside near Moscow, Brin took his father aside, looked him in the eye and said, 'Thank you for taking us all out of Russia.'"

==Censorship of Google in China==
{{details|Censorship in the People's Republic of China}}
Remembering his youth and his family's reasons for leaving the Soviet Union, he "agonized over Google's decision to appease the Communist government of China by allowing it to censor search engine results", but he decided that the Chinese would still be better off than without having Google available.

Brin's mother, Eugenia, has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.
______________________________
In 2008, he decided to make a donation to the University of Maryland School of Medicine, where his mother is being treated.
______________________________
Brin used the services of 23andMe and discovered that although Parkinson's is generally not hereditary, both he and his mother possess a mutation of the LRRK2 gene (G2019S) that puts the likelihood of him developing Parkinson's in later years between 20% and 80%.
