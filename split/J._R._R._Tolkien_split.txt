Tolkien had one sibling, his younger brother, Hilary Arthur Reuel Tolkien, who was born on 17 February 1894.
______________________________
As a child, Tolkien was bitten by a large baboon spider in the garden, an event some think later echoed in his stories, although he admitted no actual memory of the event and no special hatred of spiders as an adult.
______________________________
In another incident, a young family servant, who thought Tolkien a beautiful child, took the baby to his kraal to show him off, returning him the next morning.
______________________________
When he was three, he went to England with his mother and brother on what was intended to be a lengthy family visit.

Tolkien met Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, when he and his brother Hilary moved into the boarding house where she lived in Duchess Road, Edgbaston.
______________________________
Edith replied that she had already accepted the proposal of George Field, the brother of one of her closest schoolfriends.
______________________________
It was at this time that Edith bore their first child, John Francis Reuel Tolkien.
______________________________
In 1920, he took up a post as Reader in English Language at the University of Leeds, and became the youngest professor there.
______________________________
At the time, the consensus of scholarship deprecated ''Beowulf'' for dealing with childish battles with monsters rather than realistic tribal warfare; Tolkien argued that the author of ''Beowulf'' was addressing human destiny in general, not as limited by particular tribal politics, and therefore the monsters were essential to the poem.Tolkien: ''Finn and Hengest''.

===Family===
The Tolkiens had four children: John Francis Reuel Tolkien (17 November 1917  22 January 2003), Michael Hilary Reuel Tolkien (22 October 1920  27 February 1984), Christopher John Reuel Tolkien (born 21 November 1924) and Priscilla Mary Anne Reuel Tolkien (born 18 June 1929).
______________________________
Tolkien was very devoted to his children and sent them illustrated letters from Father Christmas when they were young.

They delighted to discuss and mull over every detail of the lives of their children, and later their grandchildren.Humphrey Carpenter, "Tolkien: The Authorized Biography", page 158.}}

In a 1945 letter to his son Christopher, he wrote:{{quote|We were supposed to have reached a stage of civilization in which it might still be necessary to execute a criminal, but not to gloat, or to hang his wife and child by him while the orc-crowd hooted.

====''The Hobbit''====
Tolkien never expected his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident a book called ''The Hobbit'', which he had written some years before for his own children, came in 1936 to the attention of Susan Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm George Allen & Unwin, who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication.
______________________________
When it was published a year later, the book attracted adult readers as well as children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel.
______________________________
Tolkien at first intended ''The Lord of the Rings'' to be a children's tale in the style of ''The Hobbit'', but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing.

===Childhood===
thumb|right|1892 Christmas card with a coloured photo of the Tolkien family in Bloemfontein, sent to relatives in Birmingham, England

John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on 3 January 1892 in Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State (now Free State Province in South Africa) to Arthur Reuel Tolkien (18571896), an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, ''ne'' Suffield (18701904).
______________________________
The couple had left England when Arthur was promoted to head the Bloemfontein office of the British bank for which he worked.
______________________________
Tolkien had one sibling, his younger brother, Hilary Arthur Reuel Tolkien, who was born on 17 February 1894.
______________________________
This left the family without an income, so Tolkien's mother took him to live with her parents in Kings Heath,''Biography'', Ch I, "Bloemfontein".
______________________________
Soon after, in 1896, they moved to Sarehole (now in Hall Green), then a Worcestershire village, later annexed to Birmingham.
______________________________
In Edgbaston, Tolkien lived there in the shadow of Perrott's Folly and the Victorian tower of Edgbaston Waterworks, which may have influenced the images of the dark towers within his works.
______________________________
Tolkien met Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, when he and his brother Hilary moved into the boarding house where she lived in Duchess Road, Edgbaston.
______________________________
On 8 January 1913, Tolkien travelled by train to Cheltenham and was met on the platform by Edith.
______________________________
He left taples on 27 June 1916 and joined his battalion at Rubempr, near Amiens.Garth (2003), pages 147148.

On 3 November 1920, Tolkien was demobilized and left the army, retaining his rank of lieutenant.
______________________________
In 1945, Tolkien moved to Merton College, Oxford, becoming the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature, in which post he remained until his retirement in 1959.
______________________________
332. and eventually he and Edith moved to Bournemouth, which was then a seaside resort patronized by the British upper middle class.
______________________________
He once said, "It may be said that the chief purpose of life, for any one of us, is to increase according to our capacity our knowledge of God by all the means we have, and to be moved by it to praise and thanks."
______________________________
Such allegory is entirely foreign to my thought.
______________________________
In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world.
______________________________
He had dismissed dramatic representations of fantasy in his essay "On Fairy-Stories", first presented in 1939:

______MULTILINGUAL______

This pronunciation no doubt arose by analogy with such words as ''toll'' and ''polka'', or because speakers of General American realise {{IPA|//}} as {{IPA|[]}}, while often hearing British {{IPA|//}} as {{IPA|[]}}; thus {{IPA|[]}} or General American {{IPA|[o]}} become the closest possible approximation to the Received Pronunciation for many American speakers.

______________________________
Young Tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees, but his favourite lessons were those concerning languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of Latin very early.

Another strong influence was the romantic medievalist paintings of Edward Burne-Jones and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood; the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery had a large collection of works on public display.Saler, Michael T.

===Youth===
While in his early teens, Tolkien had his first encounter with a constructed language, Animalic, an invention of his cousins, Mary and Marjorie Incledon.
______________________________
Their interest in Animalic soon died away, but Mary and others, including Tolkien himself, invented a new and more complex language called Nevbosh.
______________________________
The next constructed language he came to work with, Naffarin, would be his own creation.
______________________________
52, to Christopher Tolkien, 29 November 1943

Although he did not often write or speak about it, Tolkien advocated the dismantling of the British Empire and even of the United Kingdom.
______________________________
Such allegory is entirely foreign to my thought.
______________________________
In the unsent letter, Tolkien makes the point that "Aryan" is a linguistic term, denoting speakers of Indo-Iranian languages.
______________________________
I do know Celtic things (many in their original languages Irish and Welsh), and feel for them a certain distaste: largely for their fundamental unreason.
______________________________
Fimi pointed out that despite his dismissive remarks about "Celtic things" in 1937 that Tolkien was fluent in medieval Welsh (though not modern Welsh) and declared when delivering the first O'Donnell lectures at Oxford in 1954 about the influences of Celtic languages on the English language that "Welsh is beautiful".

==Languages and philology==

===Linguistic career===
Both Tolkien's academic career and his literary production are inseparable from his love of language and philology.
______________________________
Privately, Tolkien was attracted to "things of racial and linguistic significance", and in his 1955 lecture ''English and Welsh'', which is crucial to his understanding of race and language, he entertained notions of "inherent linguistic predilections", which he termed the "native language" as opposed to the "cradle-tongue" which a person first learns to speak.
______________________________
He considered the West Midlands dialect of Middle English to be his own "native language", and, as he wrote to W. H. Auden in 1955, "I am a West-midlander by blood (and took to early west-midland Middle English as a known tongue as soon as I set eyes on it).
______________________________
'', the beginning of the Quenya poem Namri written in Tengwar and in [[Latin alphabet|Latin script]]

Parallel to Tolkien's professional work as a philologist, and sometimes overshadowing this work, to the effect that his academic output remained rather thin, was his affection for constructing languages.
______________________________
A notable addition came in late 1945 with Adnaic or Nmenrean, a language of a "faintly Semitic flavour", connected with Tolkien's Atlantis legend, which by ''The Notion Club Papers'' ties directly into his ideas about the inability of language to be inherited, and via the "Second Age" and the story of Erendil was grounded in the ''legendarium'', thereby providing a link of Tolkien's 20th-century "real primary world" with the legendary past of his Middle-earth.
______________________________
Tolkien considered languages inseparable from the mythology associated with them, and he consequently took a dim view of auxiliary languages: in 1930 a congress of Esperantists were told as much by him, in his lecture ''A Secret Vice'', "Your language construction will breed a mythology", but by 1956 he had concluded that "Volapk, Esperanto, Ido, Novial, &c, &c, are dead, far deader than ancient unused languages, because their authors never invented any Esperanto legends".
______________________________
The popularity of Tolkien's books has had a small but lasting effect on the use of language in fantasy literature in particular, and even on mainstream dictionaries, which today commonly accept Tolkien's idiosyncratic spellings ''dwarves'' and ''dwarvish'' (alongside ''dwarfs'' and ''dwarfish''), which had been little used since the mid-19th century and earlier.

While a pupil there, Tolkien was one of the cadets from the school's Officers Training Corps who helped "line the route" for the 1910 coronation parade of King George V. Like the other cadets from King Edward's, Tolkien was posted just outside the gates of Buckingham Palace.

______READING______

He enjoyed exploring Sarehole Mill and Moseley Bog and the Clent, Lickey and Malvern Hills, which would later inspire scenes in his books, along with nearby towns and villages such as Bromsgrove, Alcester, and Alvechurch and places such as his aunt Jane's farm of Bag End, the name of which he used in his fiction.
______________________________
Tolkien could read by the age of four and could write fluently soon afterwards.
______________________________
His mother allowed him to read many books.

Where ''Beowulf'' does deal with specific tribal struggles, as at Finnsburg, Tolkien argued firmly against reading in fantastic elements.Tolkien: ''Finn and Hengest'', the discussion of ''Eotena'', ''passim''.

______________________________
The sales of his books were so profitable that he regretted that he had not chosen early retirement.

One of Tolkien's purposes when writing his Middle-earth books was to create what his biographer Humphrey Carter called a "mythology for England", complaining in a letter to Milton Waldman of the "poverty of my country: it had no stories of its own (bound up with its tongue and soil)" unlike the Celtic nations of Scotland, Ireland and Wales, which all had their own well developed mythologies.
______________________________
Tolkien himself never used the exact phrase "a mythology for England", but he often made statements to that effect, writing to one reader that his intention in writing the Middle-earth stories was "to restore to the English an epic tradition and present them with a mythology of their own".
______________________________
====Children's books and other short works====
In addition to his mythopoeic compositions, Tolkien enjoyed inventing fantasy stories to entertain his children.

''The Lord of the Rings'' became immensely popular in the 1960s and has remained so ever since, ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the 20th century, judged by both sales and reader surveys.

He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from him after the success of ''The Hobbit''.

The popularity of Tolkien's books has had a small but lasting effect on the use of language in fantasy literature in particular, and even on mainstream dictionaries, which today commonly accept Tolkien's idiosyncratic spellings ''dwarves'' and ''dwarvish'' (alongside ''dwarfs'' and ''dwarfish''), which had been little used since the mid-19th century and earlier.

Nine years after her death, Tolkien wrote, "My own dear mother was a martyr indeed, and it is not to everybody that God grants so easy a way to his great gifts as he did to Hilary and myself, giving us a mother who killed herself with labour and trouble to ensure us keeping the faith."

After his mother's death, Tolkien grew up in the Edgbaston area of Birmingham and attended King Edward's School, Birmingham, and later St. Philip's School.
______________________________
Their interest in Animalic soon died away, but Mary and others, including Tolkien himself, invented a new and more complex language called Nevbosh.

In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled:
{{quote|I had to choose between disobeying and grieving (or deceiving) a guardian who had been a father to me, more than most fathers ... and "dropping" the love-affair until I was 21.

On the evening of his 21st birthday, Tolkien wrote to Edith, who was living with family friend C. H. Jessop at Cheltenham.
______________________________
Field was "dreadfully upset at first", and the Field family was "insulted and angry".

Tolkien was very devoted to his children and sent them illustrated letters from Father Christmas when they were young.

It was visible in the small things, the almost absurd degree in which each worried about the other's health, and the care in which they chose and wrapped each other's birthday presents; and in the large matters, the way in which Ronald willingly abandoned such a large part of his life in retirement to give Edith the last years in Bournemouth that he felt she deserved, and the degree in which she showed pride in his fame as an author.

==Writing==
Tolkien devised several themes that were reused in successive drafts of his ''legendarium'', beginning with ''The Book of Lost Tales'', written while recuperating from illnesses contracted during The Battle of the Somme.
______________________________
Critics have compared this device to the ''Testament of Isildur'' in ''The Lord of the Rings'' and to Tolkien's efforts to produce as an illustration a realistic page from the ''Book of Mazarbul''.
______________________________
Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book.
______________________________
The lavish ink and coloured-pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive.
______________________________
The book was published in 1982 as a facsimile of Tolkien's difficult-to-read illustrated manuscript, with a typeset transcription on each facing page.

====''The Fall of Gondolin''====
''The Fall of Gondolin'' is a tale of a beautiful, mysterious city destroyed by dark forces, that called "the first real story" of Middle-earth, will be published in August 2018 as a standalone book, edited by Christopher Tolkien and illustrated by Alan Lee.

Queen Margrethe II of Denmark created illustrations to ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the early 1970s.
______________________________
In 1946, he rejected suggestions for illustrations by Horus Engels for the German edition of ''The Hobbit'' as "too Disnified ... Bilbo with a dribbling nose, and Gandalf as a figure of vulgar fun rather than the Odinic wanderer that I think of".
