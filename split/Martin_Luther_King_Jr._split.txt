'''Martin Luther King Jr.''' (January 15, 1929 April 4, 1968) was an American Baptist minister and activist who became the most visible spokesperson and leader in the civil rights movement from 1954 until his death in 1968.
______________________________
In 1968, King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., to be called the Poor People's Campaign, when he was assassinated on April 4 in Memphis, Tennessee.
______________________________
King's legal name at birth was Michael King, and his father was also born Michael King, but, after a period of gradual transition on the elder King's part, he changed both his and his son's names in 1934.
______________________________
{{sfn|King|1992|p=31}} King's parents were both African-American, and he also had Irish ancestry through his paternal great-grandfather.
______________________________
His mother was an accomplished organist and choir leader who took him to various churches to sing, and he received attention for singing "I Want to Be More and More Like Jesus".
______________________________
King said that his father regularly whipped him until he was fifteen; a neighbor reported hearing the elder King telling his son "he would make something of him even if he had to beat him to death."
______________________________
King saw his father's proud and fearless protests against segregation, such as King Sr. refusing to listen to a traffic policeman after being referred to as "boy," or stalking out of a store with his son when being told by a shoe clerk that they would have to "move to the rear" of the store to be served.
______________________________
When King was a child, he befriended a white boy whose father owned a business near his family's home.
______________________________
King lost his friend because the child's father no longer wanted the boys to play together.
______________________________
In his adolescent years, he initially felt resentment against whites due to the "racial humiliation" that he, his family, and his neighbors often had to endure in the segregated South.
______________________________
At the age of 12, shortly after his maternal grandmother died, King blamed himself and jumped out of a second-story window, but survived.
______________________________
King's father fully supported his decision to continue his education.
______________________________
King tearfully told a friend that he could not endure his mother's pain over the marriage and broke the relationship off six months later.

King married Coretta Scott on June 18, 1953, on the lawn of her parents' house in her hometown of Heiberger, Alabama.

______PERSONALITY______
' introvert' ' extrovert' ' lone' ' solitary' ' social' ' outsider'

King also opposed the Vietnam War because it took money and resources that could have been spent on social welfare at home.

Another influence for King's nonviolent method was Henry David Thoreau's essay ''On Civil Disobedience'' and its theme of refusing to cooperate with an evil system.King, M. L. Morehouse College (Chapter 2 of The Autobiography of Martin Luther King Jr.) He also was greatly influenced by the works of Protestant theologians Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich,Reinhold Niebuhr and Contemporary Politics: God and Power and said that Walter Rauschenbusch's ''Christianity and the Social Crisis'' left an "indelible imprint" on his thinking by giving him a theological grounding for his social concerns.
______________________________
King was moved by Rauschenbusch's vision of Christians spreading social unrest in "perpetual but friendly conflict" with the state, simultaneously critiquing it and calling it to act as an instrument of justice.
______________________________
King supported the ideals of democratic socialism, although he was reluctant to speak directly of this support due to the anti-communist sentiment being projected throughout the United States at the time, and the association of socialism with communism.
