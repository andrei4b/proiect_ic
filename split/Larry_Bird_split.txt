______________________________
Inside the final minute, Boston and Philadelphia were tied 8989 when Bird sank a fast-break mid-range pull-up bank shot with his left hand, a very difficult shot to execute under intense pressure.

______________________________
{{ISBN|0-385-24921-7}} He had a successful three-year career with the Sycamores, helping them reach the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history with a 33-0 record where they played the 1979 championship game against Michigan State.

Bird was named MVP of the 198384 season with averages of 24.2 points, 10.1 rebounds, 6.6 assists, and 1.8 steals per game.
______________________________
In the playoffs, the Celtics avenged their loss from the year before to the Bucks, winning in five games in the Conference Finals to advance to the Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers.

______________________________
In the playoffs, the Celtics lost only one game through the first three rounds en route to a match-up against the Rockets in the Finals.
______________________________
The apparent contrast between the two players and their respective teams seemed scripted for television: Bird, the introverted small-town hero with the blue-collar work ethic, fit perfectly with the throwback, hard-nosed style of the Celtics, while the stylish, gregarious Johnson ran the Lakers' fast-paced Showtime offense amidst the bright lights and celebrities of Los Angeles.

Eddie also played basketball at Indiana State from 1986 to 1990 and today is the city park superintendent at Terre Haute.
______________________________
For the 2008 NBA Finals, which featured a rematch of the Celtics-Lakers rivalry, Bird appeared in a split-screen advertisement with Magic Johnson (as part of the "There Can Only Be One" campaign which had played throughout the 2008 NBA Playoffs but to that point only featured players from the two teams competing in a given series) discussing the meaning of rivalries.
______________________________
Bird was widely considered one of Red Auerbach's favorite players.
______________________________
He considered Bird to be the greatest basketball player of all time.
______________________________
https://web.archive.org/web/20151120132151/ and http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/1998/bird/flashbacks/1988flash.html Auerbach was so enamored with the player that he drafted him out of Indiana State and waited a year before Bird was eligible to suit up for the Celtics.
______________________________
During his introductory press conference, after Auerbach's contentious negotiations with agent Bob Woolf, Bird announced he "would have played for free".
______________________________
This was after Woolf asked for the most lucrative contract in NBA history, to which Auerbach was quick to point out that Bird had not played a game in the NBA yet.
______________________________
==Player profile==
{{Example farm|date=January 2014}}

Bird, a wing who played the small forward and power forward positions, was nominated to twelve All-Star teams.
______________________________
His talent for recognizing the moves of opponents and teammates prompted his first coach with the Celtics, Bill Fitch, to nickname him "Kodak", because he seemed to formulate mental pictures of every play that took place on the court.
______________________________
His multidimensional game made him a consistent triple-double threat; Bird currently ranks seventh all-time in triple-doubles with 59, not including the 10 he recorded in the playoffs.
______________________________
Bird's lifetime player efficiency rating (PER) is 23.5, 18th all-time.
______________________________
Additionally, he is the only 20, 10, 5 player in NBA history (points, rebounds, assists per game) with a lifetime PRA rating (points + rebounds + assists per game) of 40.6, which is 8th all-time.
______________________________
Bird was the first player in NBA history to shoot 50% or better on field goals, 40% on three-pointers, and 90% on free-throws in a single NBA season while achieving the league minimum for makes in each category.
______________________________
While he was neither fast nor quick-footed, and could not always shut down an individual player one-on-one, he consistently displayed a knack for anticipating the moves of his opponent, allowing him to intercept passes and create turnovers.
______________________________
Bird, who was known to take insult when an opposing team put a white player on him, laughed at Collins, "Ben Poquette?
______________________________
{{ISBN|0-385-24921-7}} Eventually a shoving match ensued, then swings taken by both players, and finally a bench-clearing brawl.
______________________________
Bird and Erving were each fined $7,500 by the NBA, while a total of $15,500 in fines was levied amongst Philadelphia 76ers head coach Billy Cunningham and 15 players from both teams.
______________________________
Few players have performed as brilliantly in critical moments of games.
______________________________
The dramatic play saved the series for the Celtics who won in 7 games, and they advanced to the Finals.
______________________________
That's the greatest game I've ever played in or seen played.
______________________________
* On March 31, 1991, the Celtics played a double overtime game with the Chicago Bulls in their last meeting of the season.
______________________________
At Fenway Park that day, the Boston Red Sox were playing the California Angels.
______________________________
===Memorable games===
* On March 30, 1983, Bird scored 53 points against the Indiana Pacers to set the Celtic record for highest scoring output in a game by an individual player (the previous record belonged to Sam Jones who scored 51 points against the Detroit Pistons on October 29, 1965).
______________________________
* On February 18, 1985, Bird registered a triple double (30 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists) and also had 9 steals in three quarters of play against the Utah Jazz.
______________________________
When asked by reporters if he actually wanted to play in the 4th quarter to get the quadruple double, Bird said "What for?
______________________________
==In popular culture==
* Bird has appeared in three movies, each time playing himself: ''Blue Chips'', released in 1994 by Paramount; the Warner Brothers film ''Space Jam'' with Michael Jordan and Bill Murray, in 1996; and ''Celtic Pride'' with Dan Aykroyd, Daniel Stern, and Damon Wayans, which was also released in 1996.
______________________________
* Bird also voiced himself in the Futurama episode Saturday Morning Fun Pit, where a team of himself and his clones plays basketball against the Harlem Globetrotters.
______________________________
In ''One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird'', Bird plays opposite Julius Erving in a game of one-on-one.
______________________________
Bird is also a playable character in the revamped ''NBA Jam''.

For the 2008 NBA Finals, which featured a rematch of the Celtics-Lakers rivalry, Bird appeared in a split-screen advertisement with Magic Johnson (as part of the "There Can Only Be One" campaign which had played throughout the 2008 NBA Playoffs but to that point only featured players from the two teams competing in a given series) discussing the meaning of rivalries.

Bird was widely considered one of Red Auerbach's favorite players.

______________________________
During his introductory press conference, after Auerbach's contentious negotiations with agent Bob Woolf, Bird announced he "would have played for free".
______________________________

==Player profile==
{{Example farm|date=January 2014}}

Bird, a wing who played the small forward and power forward positions, was nominated to twelve All-Star teams.
______________________________
His talent for recognizing the moves of opponents and teammates prompted his first coach with the Celtics, Bill Fitch, to nickname him "Kodak", because he seemed to formulate mental pictures of every play that took place on the court.
______________________________
His multidimensional game made him a consistent triple-double threat; Bird currently ranks seventh all-time in triple-doubles with 59, not including the 10 he recorded in the playoffs.
______________________________
Bird's lifetime player efficiency rating (PER) is 23.5, 18th all-time.
______________________________
Additionally, he is the only 20, 10, 5 player in NBA history (points, rebounds, assists per game) with a lifetime PRA rating (points + rebounds + assists per game) of 40.6, which is 8th all-time.
______________________________
Bird was the first player in NBA history to shoot 50% or better on field goals, 40% on three-pointers, and 90% on free-throws in a single NBA season while achieving the league minimum for makes in each category.
______________________________
While he was neither fast nor quick-footed, and could not always shut down an individual player one-on-one, he consistently displayed a knack for anticipating the moves of his opponent, allowing him to intercept passes and create turnovers.
______________________________
Bird, who was known to take insult when an opposing team put a white player on him, laughed at Collins, "Ben Poquette?
______________________________
{{ISBN|0-385-24921-7}} Eventually a shoving match ensued, then swings taken by both players, and finally a bench-clearing brawl.
______________________________
Bird and Erving were each fined $7,500 by the NBA, while a total of $15,500 in fines was levied amongst Philadelphia 76ers head coach Billy Cunningham and 15 players from both teams.
______________________________
Few players have performed as brilliantly in critical moments of games.
