Lionel Andrs Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop.
______________________________
{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=3237}} Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matas, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.
______________________________
At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, Mara Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.
______________________________
{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=246249}} Ronaldinho soon befriended Messi, whom he called "little brother", which greatly eased his transition into the first team.
______________________________
At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition.
______________________________
He scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005, against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming  at that time  the youngest-ever scorer for the club.
______________________________
As the season's Champions League top scorer with nine goals, the youngest in the tournament's history, Messi scored two goals and assisted two more to ensure a 40 quarter-final victory over Bayern Munich.
______________________________
On 16 September, he became the youngest player to make 100 appearances in the UEFA Champions League in a 11 away draw to Roma.
______________________________
Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent ''La Albiceleste'' since childhood.
______________________________
In the next match, against Serbia and Montenegro, he became the youngest player to represent Argentina at a FIFA World Cup when he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute.
______________________________
He assisted their fourth strike within minutes and scored the final goal in their 60 victory, making him the youngest scorer in the tournament and the sixth-youngest goalscorer in the history of the World Cup.
______________________________
Ahead of the tournament, Maradona visited Messi in Barcelona to request his tactical input; Messi then outlined a 4312 formation with himself playing behind the two strikers, a playmaking position known as the ''enganche'' in Argentine football, which had been his preferred position since childhood.

===Charity===
Throughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood.
______________________________
Messi has served as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the recent earthquake.

But immediately you'd realise that he was born different, that he was a phenomenon and that he was going to be something impressive.
______________________________
First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age.
______________________________
In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou.
______________________________
During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the ''Infantiles'' due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league.
______________________________
At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, Mara Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.
______________________________
{{sfn|Hunter|2012|pp=4445}} At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while Fbregas and Piqu soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.
______________________________
{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=246249}} Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved Messi from his usual position onto the right flank (though initially against the player's wishes), allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot.

Due to issues regarding his legal status in the Royal Spanish Football Federation, Messi missed the start of La Liga, but on 26 September, he acquired Spanish citizenship and became eligible to play.
______________________________
{{sfn|Balagu|2013|p=472}} Ahead of the new season, a major concern remained his frequent muscular injuries, which had left him side-lined for a total of eight months between 2006 and 2008.
______________________________
To combat the problem, the club implemented new training, nutrition, and lifestyle regimens, and assigned him a personal physiotherapist, who would travel with him during call-ups for the Argentina national team.
______________________________
On 26 September, Messi sustained an injury in Barcelona's match against Las Palmas; tests later confirmed that he suffered a tear in the medial collateral ligament of his left knee, ruling him out for six to eight weeks.
______________________________
After he was left out of the starting line-up in their first match against the United States, a 10 defeat, the squad's senior players asked manager Francisco Ferraro to let Messi start, as they considered him their best player.
______________________________
After the match, Pkerman described him as "a jewel".

As Messi evolved into one of the best players in the world, he secured a place in Alfio Basile's starting line-up, as part of a team considered favourites to win the 2007 Copa Amrica, held in Venezuela.
______________________________
It was later reported that he had suffered a deep bruise in his lumbar region, but that he would remain in Martino's squad for the tournament, although he was later left on the bench in Argentina's 21 opening win over defending champions Chile on 6 June due to concerns regarding his fitness.
______________________________
Although Messi was declared match-fit for his nation's second group match against Panama on 10 June, Martino left him on the bench once again; he replaced Augusto Fernndez in the 61st minute and subsequently scored a hat-trick in 19 minutes, also starting the play which led to Sergio Agero's goal, as the match ended in a 50 victory, sealing Argentina's place in the quarter-finals of the competition; he was elected man of the match for his performance.
______________________________
Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.

His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the ''enganche'' in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward.
______________________________
{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=155156, 405406}} Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates.
______________________________
Four years later, after Messi had won his first Ballon d'Or by a record margin,{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=519524}} the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was the greatest player in history.
______________________________
Throughout his career, Messi has been compared with his compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers.
______________________________
{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=414420}} Despite having lived in Spain since age 13, Messi has said: "Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself.

On 9 September, Messi scored his first hat-trick of the 201718 league campaign, against Espanyol in derbi barcelon, thus helping to secure a 50 home victory for Blaugrana over local rivals.

On 18 October, in his 122nd European club appearance, Messi scored his 97th UEFA Champions League goal, and his 100th in all UEFA club competitions, in a 31 home victory over Olympiakos; he also set up Lucas Digne's goal during the same match.

On 4 November, he made his 600th appearance for Barcelona in a 21 home win over Sevilla in La Liga.
______________________________
On 7 January 2018, Messi made his 400th La Liga appearance with Barcelona in a 30 home win over Levante, marking the occasion with his 144th league assist and 365th league goal for the club, the latter of which saw him equal Gerd Mller's record for the most league goals scored for the same club in one of Europe's top five divisions.

On 4 March, he scored his 600th senior career goal from a free kick in a 10 home win over Atltico Madrid, in La Liga.
______________________________
On 14 March, Messi scored his 99th and 100th Champions League goals in a 30 home win over Chelsea, becoming only the second player after Cristiano Ronaldo to reach this landmark, and achieving it at a younger age, in fewer appearances, having played fewer minutes, and having taken fewer shots than his Portuguese counterpart; his opening goal, which came after only two minutes and eight seconds, was also the fastest of his career.
______________________________
{{sfn|Lisi|2011|pp=492493}} Back home, Pkerman's decision to leave him on the bench against Germany led to widespread criticism from those who believed Messi could have changed the outcome of the match in Argentina's favour.
______________________________
Back home, however, Messi was the subject of far harsher judgement.
______________________________
On 1 September 2016, in his first game back, he scored in a 10 home win over Uruguay in a 2018 World Cup qualifier.

Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players; beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiquesRonaldo is {{height|m=1.85}} with a muscular buildand contrasting public personalities, with Ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi's humility.

______________________________
{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=246249}} Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved Messi from his usual position onto the right flank (though initially against the player's wishes), allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot.

At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition.

After Ronaldinho lost form, Messi became Bara's new star player at only 20 years old, receiving the nickname "Messiah" from the Spanish media.

His efforts in 2007 also earned him award recognition; journalists voted him the third-best player of the year for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, behind Kak and runner-up Cristiano Ronaldo, while international managers and national team captains voted him second for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, again behind Kak.

During his first season under Barcelona's new manager, former captain Pep Guardiola, Messi played mainly on the right wing, like he had under Rijkaard, though this time as a false winger with the freedom to cut inside and roam the centre.
______________________________
During the ''Clsico'' on 2 May 2009, however, he played for the first time as a false nine, positioned as a centre-forward but dropping deep into midfield to link up with Xavi and Andrs Iniesta.

Among his 43 league goals that season was a hat-trick scored in 11 minutes against Rayo Vallecano on 8 March, the fastest of his senior career; it was his 32nd hat-trick overall for Barcelona, allowing him to overtake Telmo Zarra as the player with the most hat-tricks ever in Spanish football.
______________________________
Additionally, as the season's top assist provider with 18 assists, he surpassed Lus Figo as the player with the most assists in La Liga;{{refn|group=note|name="Assist statistics"|Assist statistics began in 1990.}}
______________________________
His opening goal was hailed as one of the greatest in his career; he collected the ball near the halfway line and beat four opposing players, before feinting the goalkeeper to score in a tight space by the near post.
______________________________
In addition to being the top assist provider with six assists, Messi finished the competition as the joint top scorer with ten goals, which earned him the distinction of being the first player ever to achieve the top scoring mark in five Champions League seasons.
______________________________
On 16 September, he became the youngest player to make 100 appearances in the UEFA Champions League in a 11 away draw to Roma.

Cruyff himself was "very happy" with the play, insisting "it was legal and entertaining".

______________________________
Messi's first goal marked his 350th in the fixture, becoming the first player ever to achieve this milestone.
______________________________
Three weeks later, on 1 October, Messi surpassed his former teammate Carles Puyol to become the third highest appearance maker in the club's history, as he helped ''Bara'' defeat Las Palmas 30 by assisting Sergio Busquets' opener and later adding two himself in his 594th official game for the club; the league game was played behind closed doors at the Camp Nou due to violence in Catalonia relating to an ongoing independence referendum.

______________________________
{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=384387}} In a surprise defeat, Argentina lost the final 30 to a Brazil squad which lacked several of the nation's best players.

Their unexpected loss was followed by much criticism in Argentina, though Messi was mostly exempt due to his young age and secondary status to star player Juan Romn Riquelme.

{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=384387}} Under manager Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to World Cup victory as a player, the team struggled to qualify for the 2010 World Cup, securing their place in the tournament only after defeating Uruguay 10 in their last qualifying match.
______________________________
Maradona was criticised for his strategic decisions as he played Messi out of position, positioned too deep for him to be able to contribute to the attack to his full ability.
______________________________
{{sfn|Lisi|2011|pp=533539}} During that game, played on 28 March 2009, he wore Argentina's number 10 shirt for the first time, following the international retirement of Riquelme.
______________________________
Ahead of the tournament, Maradona visited Messi in Barcelona to request his tactical input; Messi then outlined a 4312 formation with himself playing behind the two strikers, a playmaking position known as the ''enganche'' in Argentine football, which had been his preferred position since childhood.
______________________________
During the next match, against South Korea, he excelled in his playmaking role, participating in all four goals of his side's 41 victory.

{{sfn|Lisi|2011|pp=564567}} FIFA subsequently identified Messi as one of the tournament's 10 best players, citing his "outstanding" pace and creativity and "spectacular and efficient" dribbling, shooting and passing.
______________________________
As the perceived best player in the world, he had been expected to lead an average team to the title, as Maradona arguably did in 1986, but he had failed to replicate his performances at Barcelona with the national team, leading to the accusation that he cared less about his country than his club.

Reserved by nature, Messi went on to lead his squad by example as their best player, while Mascherano continued to fulfil the role of the team's on-field leader and motivator.

In his first World Cup match as captain, he led them to a 21 victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina; he helped create their early opening goal and scored their second strike after a dribble past three players, his first World Cup goal since his debut in the tournament eight years earlier.

Messi assisted a late goal in extra time to ensure a 10 win against Switzerland in the round of 16, before starting the play that led to their match-winning 10 goal in the quarter-final against Belgium, helping Argentina progress to the semi-final of the World Cup for the first time since 1990.

==Player profile==

===Style of play===
{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote="I have fun like a child in the street.
______________________________
Due to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles; this has led the Spanish media to dub him ''La Pulga Atmica'' ("The Atomic Flea").
______________________________
Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting.
______________________________
His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, "Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it."
______________________________
Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.
______________________________
He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and precise passing, and is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker, though his ability on penalties has somewhat deteriorated in recent seasons.
______________________________
Widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world, and one of the greatest of all time, with regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, "The ball stays glued to his foot; I've seen great players in my career, but I've never seen anyone with Messi's ball control."
______________________________
Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andrs Iniesta.
______________________________
It was she who encouraged a young Messi to play, and also took him to games.
______________________________
Tactically, Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch.
______________________________
His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the ''enganche'' in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward.
______________________________
Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, dribbling runs or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta.
______________________________
Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career, while also being deployed in a deeper, free role.
______________________________
With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, or in a deeper, creative role as a classic number 10 or attacking midfielder.
______________________________
===Reception===
A prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world's best players before age 20.
______________________________
Diego Maradona considered the 18-year-old Messi the best player in the world alongside Ronaldinho, while the Brazilian himself, shortly after winning the Ballon d'Or, commented, "I'm not even the best at Bara," in reference to his protg.
______________________________
Four years later, after Messi had won his first Ballon d'Or by a record margin,{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=519524}} the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was the greatest player in history.
______________________________
An early proponent was his then-manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen.
______________________________
In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players, and by the end of Bara's second treble-winning season, Messi's superiority, ahead of Maradona and Pel, had become the predominant view among insiders in continental Europe.
______________________________
A frequent dismissal, however, has centred on the fact that Messi has not won the FIFA World Cup with Argentina, leading some in the sport to instead cite him as the best club player in history.
______________________________
{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote="I've seen the player who will inherit my place in Argentinian football and his name is Messi.
______________________________
Throughout his career, Messi has been compared with his compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers.
______________________________
Initially, he was merely one of many young Argentine players, including his boyhood idol Pablo Aimar, to receive the "New Maradona" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player Argentina had produced since Maradona.
______________________________
Csar Menotti, who as manager orchestrated their 1978 World Cup victory, echoed this sentiment when he opined that Messi plays "at the level of the best Maradona".
______________________________
Other notable Argentines in the sport, such as Osvaldo Ardiles, Javier Zanetti, and Diego Simeone, have expressed their belief that Messi has overtaken Maradona as the best player in history.
______________________________
An enduring mark against him is the fact that, although through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera Divisin as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age, while his lack of outward passion for the ''Albiceleste'' shirthe does not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displayshave in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine.
______________________________
Although Messi has at times denied any rivalry, they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world: since 2008, both players have won five Ballons d'Or and four European Golden Shoes.
______________________________
Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players; beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiquesRonaldo is {{height|m=1.85}} with a muscular buildand contrasting public personalities, with Ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi's humility.

According to ''France Football'', Messi was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the 40million benchmark, with earnings of 41million in 2013, and the 5060million points, with income of 65million in 2014.
______________________________
In 2018 he was the first player to exceed the 100m benchmark for a calendar year, with earnings of 126m ($154m) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements deals.

Messi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires.
______________________________
His former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players.

Facing the judge, he said, "I just played football."

______PERSONALITY______
' introvert' ' extrovert' ' lone' ' solitary' ' social' ' outsider' 
On social networks, ''NoTeVayasLeo'' became a global trending topic, and even a playlist on Spotify.
______________________________
Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, dribbling runs or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta.
______________________________
Messi is in some ways the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football.
______________________________
Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.
______________________________
His fanbase on the social media website Facebook is among the largest of all public figures: within seven hours of its launch in April 2011, his Facebook page had nearly sevenmillion followers, and by November 2013, he had become only the second sportsperson, after Cristiano Ronaldo, to amass over 50million followers.
______________________________
He's introverted.
______________________________
He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children.
______________________________

______HEALTH ISSUES______
' health' ' depression' ' suffer' ' hospital' ' drug' ' medicine' ' ill' ' recover' 
As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.
______________________________
At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, Mara Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.
______________________________
A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution.
______________________________
{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=279284}}{{sfn|Hunter|2012|pp=266269}} After he had scored 8 goals in 25 games, including his first in the Champions League, his season ended prematurely during the return leg against Chelsea on 7 March 2006, when he suffered a torn hamstring.
______________________________
He recovered in time for the last 16 round of the Champions League against Liverpool, but was effectively marked out of the game; Barcelona, the reigning champions, were out of the competition.
______________________________
{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=519524}} Although he managed to score 16 goals  during the 200708 campaign, the second half of his season was again marred by injuries after he suffered a torn hamstring on 15 December.
______________________________
However, their performances deteriorated in the second half of the 201213 campaign, concurrently with Vilanova's absence due to ill health.
______________________________
After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain, his appearances became sporadic.
______________________________
Following an irregular start to the new season under manager Gerardo Martino, formerly of his boyhood club Newell's Old Boys, Messi suffered his fifth injury of 2013 when he tore his hamstring on 10 November, leaving him sidelined for two months.
______________________________
On 26 September, Messi sustained an injury in Barcelona's match against Las Palmas; tests later confirmed that he suffered a tear in the medial collateral ligament of his left knee, ruling him out for six to eight weeks.
______________________________
It was later reported that he had suffered a deep bruise in his lumbar region, but that he would remain in Martino's squad for the tournament, although he was later left on the bench in Argentina's 21 opening win over defending champions Chile on 6 June due to concerns regarding his fitness.
______________________________
Other events have illustrated Messi's presence in popular culture.
______________________________
thumb|left|upright|Messi pictured in July 2014
In addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children.
______________________________
It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society.
______________________________

______SPORTS______
' play' ' sport' 
After winning a libel case in 2017, Messi's own management company stated: "The football player Lionel Andres Messi Cuccittini has donated a total of 72,783.20 to the organisation Doctors Without Borders.
______________________________
born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for Spanish club Barcelona and the Argentine national team.
______________________________
Often considered the best player in the world and regarded by many as the greatest of all time, Messi has a record-tying five Ballon d'Or awards,{{refn|group=note|In addition to four FIFA Ballons d'Or, Messi received ''France Football''{{'}}s Ballon d'Or and FIFA's World Player of the Year award prior to their fusion; both organisations credit him with five (FIFA) Ballons d'Or.}}
______________________________
Both a prolific goalscorer and a creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most official goals scored in La Liga (383), a La Liga season (50), a club football season in Europe (73), a calendar year (91), El Clsico (26), as well as those for most assists in La Liga (149) and the Copa Amrica (11).
______________________________
Despite being injury-prone during his early career, he established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, finishing 2007 as a finalist for both the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award, a feat he repeated the following year.
______________________________
His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who declared the teenager his successor.
______________________________
After making his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup during the 2006 edition, and reached the final of the 2007 Copa Amrica, where he was named young player of the tournament.

==Early life==
thumb|left|180px|5-year-old Lionel Messi with Club Abanderado Grandoli of Rosario, where he started to play football
Lionel Andrs Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop.
______________________________
{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=3237}} Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matas, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.
______________________________
{{sfn|Caioli|2012|pp=910}} At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.
______________________________
{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=4445}}

{{quote box|width=27%|align=right|quote="When you saw him you would think: this kid can't play ball.
______________________________
During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of "The Machine of '87", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games.
______________________________
{{sfn|Caioli|2012|pp=3135}} However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, at age 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency.
______________________________
He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker, Pablo Aimar, he idolised, but they were also unable to pay for his treatment due to the country's economic collapse.
______________________________
First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age.
______________________________
During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the ''Infantiles'' due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league.
______________________________
Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc Fbregas and Gerard Piqu.

====200305: Rise to the first team====
{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="It seemed as if he had been playing with us all his life.
______________________________
After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the ''Juveniles'' B, he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the ''Juveniles A'', where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.
______________________________
{{sfn|Caioli|2012|pp=6871}} Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break.

He would dribble past four players and score a goal.
______________________________
{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=191193}} After his first training session with the senior squad, Bara's new star player, Ronaldinho, told his teammates that he believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself.

To gain further match experience, Messi joined Barcelona C in addition to the ''Juveniles'' A, playing his first game for the third team on 29 November.
______________________________
{{sfn|Caioli|2012|pp=6871}}{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=262263}} He played five games with the B team that season but did not score.
______________________________
{{sfn|Caioli|2012|pp=6871}}{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=183185}}

During the 200405 season, Messi was a guaranteed starter for the B team, playing 17 games throughout the campaign and scoring on six occasions.
______________________________
{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=246249}} Since his debut the previous November, he had not been called up to the first team again, but in October 2004, the senior players asked manager Frank Rijkaard to promote him.
______________________________
{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=246249}} Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved Messi from his usual position onto the right flank (though initially against the player's wishes), allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot.
______________________________
At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition.
______________________________
As a substitute player, he played only 77 minutes in nine matches for the first team that season, including his debut in the UEFA Champions League against Shakhtar Donetsk.

On 24 June 2005, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first contract as a senior team player.
______________________________
It made him a Barcelona player until 2010, two years less than his previous contract, but his buyout clause increased to 150million.

Due to issues regarding his legal status in the Royal Spanish Football Federation, Messi missed the start of La Liga, but on 26 September, he acquired Spanish citizenship and became eligible to play.
______________________________
{{sfn|Hunter|2012|pp=266269}} He was in the starting line-up in major matches like his first ''Clsico'' against rivals Real Madrid on 19 November, as well as Barcelona's away victory over Chelsea in the last 16 round of the Champions League, where he played his best match to that point.
______________________________
{{sfn|Hunter|2012|pp=266269}}

While Barcelona began a gradual decline, the 19-year-old Messi established himself as one of the best players in the world during the 200607 campaign.
______________________________
On 10 March 2007, he scored his first hat-trick in a ''Clsico'', the first player to do so in 12 years, equalising after each goal by Real Madrid to end the match in a 33 draw in extra time.
______________________________
After Ronaldinho lost form, Messi became Bara's new star player at only 20 years old, receiving the nickname "Messiah" from the Spanish media.
______________________________
His efforts in 2007 also earned him award recognition; journalists voted him the third-best player of the year for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, behind Kak and runner-up Cristiano Ronaldo, while international managers and national team captains voted him second for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, again behind Kak.
______________________________
Rijkaard had fielded him despite warning from the medical staff, leading captain Carles Puyol to criticise the Spanish media for pressuring Messi to play every match.
______________________________
He signed a new contract in July 2008 on an annual salary of 7.8million, becoming the club's highest-paid player.
______________________________
thumb|Messi in the [[2009 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League final against Manchester United in May 2009]]

During his first season under Barcelona's new manager, former captain Pep Guardiola, Messi played mainly on the right wing, like he had under Rijkaard, though this time as a false winger with the freedom to cut inside and roam the centre.
______________________________
During the ''Clsico'' on 2 May 2009, however, he played for the first time as a false nine, positioned as a centre-forward but dropping deep into midfield to link up with Xavi and Andrs Iniesta.
______________________________
{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=453459}} Returning to the wing, he played his first final since breaking into the first team on 13 May, scoring once and assisting a second goal as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 41 to win the Copa del Rey.

{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote="Messi is the best player in the world by some distance.
______________________________
Unsatisfied with his position on the right wing, Messi resumed playing as a false nine in early 2010, beginning with a Champions League last 16-round match against VfB Stuttgart.
______________________________
Assuming a playmaking role, he was again instrumental in a ''Clsico'' on 29 November 2010, the first with Jos Mourinho in charge of Real Madrid, as Barcelona defeated their rivals 50.
______________________________
Towards the end of the season, Barcelona played four ''Clsicos'' in the span of 18 days.
______________________________
After Barcelona lost the Copa del Rey final four days later, Messi scored both goals in his side's 20 win in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals, the second of which  a dribble past three players  was acclaimed as one of the best ever in the competition.
______________________________
He finished the season with 53 goals and 24 assists in all competitions, becoming Barcelona's all-time single-season top scorer and the first player in Spanish football to reach the 50-goal benchmark.
______________________________
At the close of the year, on 18 December, he scored twice in the FIFA Club World Cup final, a 40 victory over Santos, earning the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament, as he had done two years previously.
______________________________
For his efforts in 2011, he again received the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d'Or three times, after Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini, and Marco van Basten.
______________________________
By then, Messi was already widely considered one of the best footballers in history, alongside players like Diego Maradona and Pel.
______________________________
In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying Jos Altafini's record from the 196263 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd Mller to be top scorer in four campaigns.
______________________________
As the odds-on favourite, Messi again won the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming the only player in history to win the Ballon d'Or four times.
______________________________
{{sfn|Balagu|2013|p=556}} He wore the captain's armband for the first time a month later, on 17 March, in a league match against Rayo Vallecano; by then, he had become the team's tactical focal point to a degree that was arguably rivalled only by former Barcelona players Josep Samitier, Lszl Kubala and Johan Cruyff.

Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich and was unable to play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 70 on aggregate by the eventual champions.
______________________________
These matches gave credence to the notion of ''Messidependencia'', Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.
______________________________
Further damage to his hamstring sustained on 12 May ended his goalscoring streak of 21 consecutive league games, a worldwide record; he had netted 33 goals during his run, including a four-goal display against Osasuna, while becoming the first player to score consecutively against all 19 opposition teams in La Liga.
______________________________
|date=27 January 2013 |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/sport/football/European_football/article1203156.ece |accessdate=9 August 2015}} With 60 goals  in all competitions, including 46 goals in La Liga, he finished the campaign as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for the second consecutive year, becoming the first player in history to win the European Golden Shoe three times.
______________________________
He still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 March against Osasuna saw him overtake Paulino Alcntara's 369 goals to become Barcelona's top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against Real Madrid on 23 March made him the all-time top scorer in ''El Clsico'', ahead of the 18 goals scored by former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di Stfano.
______________________________
After prolonged speculation over his future with the club, Messi signed a new contract on 19 May 2014, only a year after his last contractual update; his salary increased to 20million, or 36million before taxes, the highest wage ever in the sport.

______________________________
After five years of playing in the centre of the pitch, Messi had returned to his old position on the right wing late the previous year, by his own suggestion according to Surez, their striker.
______________________________
From there, he regained his best  arguably his best-ever  form, while Surez and Neymar ended the team's attacking dependency on their star player.
______________________________
Among his 43 league goals that season was a hat-trick scored in 11 minutes against Rayo Vallecano on 8 March, the fastest of his senior career; it was his 32nd hat-trick overall for Barcelona, allowing him to overtake Telmo Zarra as the player with the most hat-tricks ever in Spanish football.
______________________________
Additionally, as the season's top assist provider with 18 assists, he surpassed Lus Figo as the player with the most assists in La Liga;{{refn|group=note|name="Assist statistics"|Assist statistics began in 1990.}}
______________________________
His opening goal was hailed as one of the greatest in his career; he collected the ball near the halfway line and beat four opposing players, before feinting the goalkeeper to score in a tight space by the near post.
______________________________
His second goal, which came only three minutes after his first, saw him chip the ball over goalkeeper Manuel Neuer after his dribble past Jrme Boateng had made the defender drop to the ground; it went viral, becoming the year's most tweeted about sporting moment, and was named the best goal of the season by UEFA.
______________________________
In addition to being the top assist provider with six assists, Messi finished the competition as the joint top scorer with ten goals, which earned him the distinction of being the first player ever to achieve the top scoring mark in five Champions League seasons.
______________________________
On 16 September, he became the youngest player to make 100 appearances in the UEFA Champions League in a 11 away draw to Roma.
______________________________
With teammate Luis Surez scoring the other four goals in the same match, this was the first time that two players had scored at least three goals each at Camp Nou, and the first time since Luis Surez Miramontes and Justo Tejada in 1956.
______________________________
The Celta players, however, never complained and their coach defended the penalty, stating, "Barca's forwards are very respectful."
______________________________
Cruyff himself was "very happy" with the play, insisting "it was legal and entertaining".
______________________________
No, the club is bigger than any manager, than any player... except Leo.
______________________________
On 13 September 2016, Messi scored his first hat-trick of the season in the opening game of the 201617 UEFA Champions League campaign against Celtic in a 70 victory; this was also Messi's sixth hat-trick in the Champions League, the most by any player.
______________________________
Messi's first goal marked his 350th in the fixture, becoming the first player ever to achieve this milestone.
______________________________
Three weeks later, on 1 October, Messi surpassed his former teammate Carles Puyol to become the third highest appearance maker in the club's history, as he helped ''Bara'' defeat Las Palmas 30 by assisting Sergio Busquets' opener and later adding two himself in his 594th official game for the club; the league game was played behind closed doors at the Camp Nou due to violence in Catalonia relating to an ongoing independence referendum.
______________________________
Messi became only the second player after Cristiano Ronaldo to reach this century milestone, but accomplished it in 21 fewer appearances than the Portuguese counterpart.
______________________________
On 14 March, Messi scored his 99th and 100th Champions League goals in a 30 home win over Chelsea, becoming only the second player after Cristiano Ronaldo to reach this landmark, and achieving it at a younger age, in fewer appearances, having played fewer minutes, and having taken fewer shots than his Portuguese counterpart; his opening goal, which came after only two minutes and eight seconds, was also the fastest of his career.
______________________________
==International career==

===200405: Success at youth level===
As a dual Argentine-Spanish national, Messi was eligible to play for the national team of both countries.
______________________________
Selectors for Spain's Under-17 squad began pursuing him in 2003 after Barcelona's director of football, Carles Rexach, alerted the Royal Spanish Football Federation to their young player.
______________________________
To further prevent Spain from taking him, the Argentine Football Association organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in FIFA.
______________________________
After he was left out of the starting line-up in their first match against the United States, a 10 defeat, the squad's senior players asked manager Francisco Ferraro to let Messi start, as they considered him their best player.
______________________________
Ahead of the final, he was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament.
______________________________
In the next match, against Serbia and Montenegro, he became the youngest player to represent Argentina at a FIFA World Cup when he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute.
______________________________
{{sfn|Lisi|2011|pp=470471}} In the round of 16 match against Mexico, played on his 19th birthday, Messi came on in the 84th minute, with the score tied at 11.
______________________________
{{sfn|Lisi|2011|pp=485486}} He did not play in the quarter-final against Germany, during which Argentina were eliminated 42 in a penalty shootout.

===200708: Copa Amrica final and Olympic gold===
thumb|Messi evades Brazil's [[Marcelo (footballer, born 1988)|Marcelo in the semi-final of the 2008 Summer Olympics]]

As Messi evolved into one of the best players in the world, he secured a place in Alfio Basile's starting line-up, as part of a team considered favourites to win the 2007 Copa Amrica, held in Venezuela.
______________________________
{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=384387}} In a surprise defeat, Argentina lost the final 30 to a Brazil squad which lacked several of the nation's best players.
______________________________
Their unexpected loss was followed by much criticism in Argentina, though Messi was mostly exempt due to his young age and secondary status to star player Juan Romn Riquelme.
______________________________
{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=384387}} He was named the best young player of the tournament by CONMEBOL.
______________________________
{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=436437}} Along with Riquelme, Messi was singled out by FIFA as the stand-out player from the tournament's best team.
______________________________
{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=384387}} Under manager Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to World Cup victory as a player, the team struggled to qualify for the 2010 World Cup, securing their place in the tournament only after defeating Uruguay 10 in their last qualifying match.
______________________________
Maradona was criticised for his strategic decisions as he played Messi out of position, positioned too deep for him to be able to contribute to the attack to his full ability.
______________________________
{{sfn|Lisi|2011|pp=533539}} During that game, played on 28 March 2009, he wore Argentina's number 10 shirt for the first time, following the international retirement of Riquelme.
______________________________
Ahead of the tournament, Maradona visited Messi in Barcelona to request his tactical input; Messi then outlined a 4312 formation with himself playing behind the two strikers, a playmaking position known as the ''enganche'' in Argentine football, which had been his preferred position since childhood.
______________________________
During the next match, against South Korea, he excelled in his playmaking role, participating in all four goals of his side's 41 victory.
______________________________
{{sfn|Lisi|2011|pp=533539}} He wore the captain's armband for the first time in their 20 win against Greece; as the focal point of their play, he helped create their second goal to see Argentina finish as group winners.
______________________________
{{sfn|Lisi|2011|pp=564567}} FIFA subsequently identified Messi as one of the tournament's 10 best players, citing his "outstanding" pace and creativity and "spectacular and efficient" dribbling, shooting and passing.
______________________________
As the perceived best player in the world, he had been expected to lead an average team to the title, as Maradona arguably did in 1986, but he had failed to replicate his performances at Barcelona with the national team, leading to the accusation that he cared less about his country than his club.
______________________________
Reserved by nature, Messi went on to lead his squad by example as their best player, while Mascherano continued to fulfil the role of the team's on-field leader and motivator.
______________________________
{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=595602}} In a further redesign of the team, Sabella dismissed Tevez and brought in players with whom Messi had won the World Youth Championship and Olympic Games.
______________________________
Now playing in a free role in an improving team, Messi finally ended his goal drought by scoring during their first World Cup qualifying match against Chile on 7 October, his first official goal for Argentina in two-and-a-half years.
______________________________
In his first World Cup match as captain, he led them to a 21 victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina; he helped create their early opening goal and scored their second strike after a dribble past three players, his first World Cup goal since his debut in the tournament eight years earlier.
______________________________
Messi assisted a late goal in extra time to ensure a 10 win against Switzerland in the round of 16, before starting the play that led to their match-winning 10 goal in the quarter-final against Belgium, helping Argentina progress to the semi-final of the World Cup for the first time since 1990.
______________________________
thumb|left|upright|Messi battles Germany's Mats Hummels for the ball during the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final|final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup]]

Billed as Messi versus Germany, the world's best player against the best team, the final was a repeat of the 1990 final featuring Diego Maradona.
______________________________
Within the first half-hour, Messi had started the play that led to a goal, but it was ruled offside.
______________________________
At the conclusion of the final, Messi was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament.
______________________________
At the semi-final stage, Messi excelled as playmaker as he provided three assists and helped create three more goals in his side's 61 victory over Paraguay, receiving applause from the initially hostile crowd.
______________________________
Faced with aggression from opposing players, including taking a boot to the midriff, Messi played below his standards, though he was the only Argentine to successfully convert his penalty.
______________________________
Although Messi was declared match-fit for his nation's second group match against Panama on 10 June, Martino left him on the bench once again; he replaced Augusto Fernndez in the 61st minute and subsequently scored a hat-trick in 19 minutes, also starting the play which led to Sergio Agero's goal, as the match ended in a 50 victory, sealing Argentina's place in the quarter-finals of the competition; he was elected man of the match for his performance.
______________________________
Sources reported that other Argentine players  Sergio Agero, Javier Mascherano, Gonzalo Higuan, Lucas Biglia, ver Banega, Ezequiel Lavezzi and ngel Di Mara  could follow their captain in retiring from international football.
______________________________
But I think the best player ever played today here in the United States."
______________________________
Messi finished the tournament as the second highest scorer, behind Eduardo Vargas, with five goals, and was the highest assist provider with four assists, also winning more Man of the Match awards than any other player in the tournament (3); he was named to the team of the tournament for his performances, but missed out on the Golden Ball Award for best player, which went to Alexis Snchez. }}
______________________________
President of Argentina Mauricio Macri urged Messi not to quit, stating, "We are lucky, it is one of life's pleasures, it is a gift from God to have the best player in the world in a footballing country like ours... Lionel Messi is the greatest thing we have in Argentina and we must take care of him."

Just a week after Messi announced his international retirement, Argentine newspaper ''La Nacin'' reported that he was reconsidering playing for Argentina at the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in September.
______________________________
On 5 May 2017, Messi's four match ban as well as his 10,000 CHF fine was lifted by FIFA after Argentina Football Association appealed against his suspension, which meant he could now play Argentina's remaining World Cup Qualifiers.
______________________________
==Player profile==

===Style of play===
{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote="I have fun like a child in the street.
______________________________
Due to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles; this has led the Spanish media to dub him ''La Pulga Atmica'' ("The Atomic Flea").
______________________________
Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting.
______________________________
His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, "Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it."
______________________________
Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.
______________________________
He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and precise passing, and is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker, though his ability on penalties has somewhat deteriorated in recent seasons.
______________________________
Widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world, and one of the greatest of all time, with regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, "The ball stays glued to his foot; I've seen great players in my career, but I've never seen anyone with Messi's ball control."
______________________________
Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andrs Iniesta.
______________________________
It was she who encouraged a young Messi to play, and also took him to games.
______________________________
Tactically, Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch.
______________________________
His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the ''enganche'' in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward.
______________________________
Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, dribbling runs or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta.
______________________________
Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career, while also being deployed in a deeper, free role.
______________________________
With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, or in a deeper, creative role as a classic number 10 or attacking midfielder.
______________________________
===Reception===
A prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world's best players before age 20.
______________________________
Diego Maradona considered the 18-year-old Messi the best player in the world alongside Ronaldinho, while the Brazilian himself, shortly after winning the Ballon d'Or, commented, "I'm not even the best at Bara," in reference to his protg.
______________________________
Four years later, after Messi had won his first Ballon d'Or by a record margin,{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=519524}} the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was the greatest player in history.
______________________________
An early proponent was his then-manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen.
______________________________
In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players, and by the end of Bara's second treble-winning season, Messi's superiority, ahead of Maradona and Pel, had become the predominant view among insiders in continental Europe.
______________________________
A frequent dismissal, however, has centred on the fact that Messi has not won the FIFA World Cup with Argentina, leading some in the sport to instead cite him as the best club player in history.
______________________________
{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote="I've seen the player who will inherit my place in Argentinian football and his name is Messi.
______________________________
Throughout his career, Messi has been compared with his compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers.
______________________________
Initially, he was merely one of many young Argentine players, including his boyhood idol Pablo Aimar, to receive the "New Maradona" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player Argentina had produced since Maradona.
______________________________
Csar Menotti, who as manager orchestrated their 1978 World Cup victory, echoed this sentiment when he opined that Messi plays "at the level of the best Maradona".
______________________________
Other notable Argentines in the sport, such as Osvaldo Ardiles, Javier Zanetti, and Diego Simeone, have expressed their belief that Messi has overtaken Maradona as the best player in history.
______________________________
An enduring mark against him is the fact that, although through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera Divisin as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age, while his lack of outward passion for the ''Albiceleste'' shirthe does not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displayshave in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine.
______________________________
===Comparisons to Cristiano Ronaldo===
{{main|MessiRonaldo rivalry}}
thumb|upright|Messi has been [[MessiRonaldo rivalry|compared to Cristiano Ronaldo (left) throughout much of their careers]]
Among his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad AliJoe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Bjrn BorgJohn McEnroe rivalry in tennis, and the Ayrton SennaAlain Prost rivalry from Formula One.
______________________________
Although Messi has at times denied any rivalry, they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world: since 2008, both players have won five Ballons d'Or and four European Golden Shoes.
______________________________
Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players; beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiquesRonaldo is {{height|m=1.85}} with a muscular buildand contrasting public personalities, with Ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi's humility.
______________________________
Messi faces Ronaldo at least twice every season in ''El Clsico'', which ranks among the world's most viewed annual sports events.
______________________________
According to ''France Football'', Messi was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the 40million benchmark, with earnings of 41million in 2013, and the 5060million points, with income of 65million in 2014.
______________________________
In 2018 he was the first player to exceed the 100m benchmark for a calendar year, with earnings of 126m ($154m) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements deals.
______________________________
Retrieved 4 June 2018 Since 2008, he has been Barcelona's highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from 7.8million to 13million over the next five years.
______________________________
His main sponsor since 2006 is the sportswear company Adidas.
______________________________
thumb|left|A mural of Messi's likeness in the [[San Siro (district)|San Siro district of Milan, photographed in 2013]]

As a commercial entity, Messi's marketing brand has been based exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Cristiano Ronaldo and David Beckham.
______________________________
At the start of his career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Konami.
______________________________
From 2010 onwards, concurrently with his increased achievements as a player, his marketing appeal widened, leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce & Gabbana and Audemars Piguet.
______________________________
His fanbase on the social media website Facebook is among the largest of all public figures: within seven hours of its launch in April 2011, his Facebook page had nearly sevenmillion followers, and by November 2013, he had become only the second sportsperson, after Cristiano Ronaldo, to amass over 50million followers.
______________________________
According to a 2014 survey by sports research firm Repucom in 15 international markets, Messi was familiar to 87% of respondents around the world, of whom 78% perceived him favourably, making him the second-most recognised player globally, behind Ronaldo, and the most likable of all contemporary players.
______________________________
World Press Photo selected "The Final Game", a photograph of Messi facing the World Cup trophy after Argentina's final defeat to Germany, as the best sports image of 2014.
______________________________
He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his best friend since childhood, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player.
______________________________
Although considered a one-club man, he has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's.
______________________________
thumb|left|upright|Messi pictured in July 2014
In addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children.
______________________________
Messi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires.
______________________________
His former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players.

Facing the judge, he said, "I just played football."
