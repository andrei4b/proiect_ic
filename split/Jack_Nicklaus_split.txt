______________________________
In addition, at age 22, Nicklaus was the youngest U.S. Open champion since Bobby Jones won at age 21 in 1923, and he has remained the youngest winner since (John McDermott is still the youngest winner of the U.S. Open at age 19 in 1911).The Boston Globe, August 13, 2013 The U.S. Open win thrust Nicklaus into the national spotlight, and he was featured on the cover of ''Time'' magazine.

When Nicklaus won the Masters in 1965 and 1966, he became the tournament's first back-to-back winner and the youngest two-time and three-time winner.
______________________________
This win made him the youngest player, age 26 (his fifth year on Tour), and the only one after Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, and Gary Player (until Tiger Woods at age 24 in 2000, also during his fifth year on Tour) to win all four major championships, now known as the Career Slam.

===Continued excellence: 19641967===
Despite winning no majors in 1964 (he had three runner-up finishes), Nicklaus led the PGA Tour money list for the first time in his career by a slim margin of $81.13 over Palmer.

At the 1998 Masters, Nicklaus was 58 when he tied for sixth place despite being hampered by an ever-increasing painful left hip.
______________________________
In announcing his donation of services (valued at $500,000), Nicklaus said, "I was moved to see the amazing efforts at American Lake Veterans Golf Course where our wounded warriors learn to play golf with the help of an incredible army of volunteers."
______________________________
The young golfer was right-handed but played left-handed; although he was showing considerable promise as a left-hander, he had been told that he might be an even better player if he switched to right-handed play.
______________________________
He wrote Nicklaus asking for advice; Nicklaus immediately wrote back telling him not to change if he was comfortable playing left-handed.
______________________________
The young Canadian, Mike Weir, decided to stay with left-handed play, and eventually became a Masters champion.
______________________________
Nicklaus considers his longest drive in competition to be during the final round of the 1964 Masters on the 15th hole, where he had less than 160 yards left to the 500 yard par five.

'''Jack William Nicklaus''' (born January 21, 1940), nicknamed '''The Golden Bear''', is a retired American professional golfer.
______________________________
Nicklaus turned professional at age 21 toward the end of 1961.
______________________________
He earned his first professional win a major championship, the 1962 U.S. Open, when he defeated Palmer by three shots in a next day 18-hole  playoff.
______________________________
Between 1971 and 1980, he won an additional nine major championships, overtook Bobby Jones' record of 13 majors, and became the first player to complete double and triple career slams of golf's four professional major championships.
______________________________
Charlie Nicklaus died of pancreatic cancer at age fifty six.https://www.everydayhealth.com/pancreatic-cancer/1006/dana-delany-jack-nicklaus-lisa-niemi-swayze-unite-to-raise-awareness-for-pancreatic-cancer.aspx

Nicklaus was raised in Upper Arlington and attended Upper Arlington High School, whose nickname and mascot are coincidentally the Golden Bears.
______________________________
He won the Ohio Open in 1956 at age 16, highlighted by a phenomenal third round of 64, competing against professionals.
______________________________
He majored in pre-pharmacy and had good grades in his first three years; he intended to follow his father into pharmacy after graduation.
______________________________
In early November, he changed his mind and announced that he was turning professional in order to support his family.
______________________________
While Nicklaus officially turned professional in late 1961, he heavily debated the idea of remaining an amateur in order to further emulate his idol, Bobby Jones.
______________________________
Shortly after turning professional, Nicklaus' future agent, Mark McCormack, was interviewed by ''Melbourne Age'' writer Don Lawrence, who inquired about the American golf scene.
______________________________
When McCormack described Nicklaus, Lawrence referred to the "large, strong, and blond" player as "the Golden Bear," a nickname that would become synonymous with Nicklaus throughout his professional life.
______________________________
As mentioned above, Nicklaus played on several Golden Bear athletic teams, including captaining its 1956 state-champion golf squad, suggesting that McCormack may have adopted the name through Nicklaus' high school affiliation.
______________________________
These victories made him the then-youngest winner of the Masters and third-youngest winner of the PGA Championship, and each win came in just his second year as a professional.
______________________________
====Business success====
Nicklaus' meteoric rise to fame immediately after turning professional brought opportunities for him to earn significant endorsement income.
______________________________
For most of his professional career, Nicklaus employed Angelo Argea as his caddie.
______________________________
Moreover, his highest finish on the Tour money list for the years 196870 was second; his lowest was fourth, his worst ranking on the list since turning professional.
______________________________
In February 1970, Nicklaus' father, Charlie Nicklaus, died.
______________________________
And then my father died and I sort of realized that he had certainly lived his life through my golf game.
______________________________
These rankings, the first attempt to take into account results from professional tours around the world, were not official during that era, but they eventually evolved into the current Official World Golf Ranking, starting in 1986.
______________________________
This victory was also Nicklaus' 11th professional major, tying him with Walter Hagen, and made him the first player to win the U.S.
______________________________
Bobby Jones' record of majors was soon broken when Nicklaus won the PGA Championship in August 1973 by four shots over Bruce Crampton for his 12th professional major (surpassing Hagen's mark of 11) and 14th overall when using the old-style configuration of Jones' day.
______________________________
The changes in team selection procedure were approved by descendants of the Samuel Ryder family, along with The PGA of America.
______________________________
This meant that professional players on the European Tournament Players' Division, the forerunner to the European Tour we have today, from continental Europe would be eligible to play in the Ryder Cup.
______________________________
This was the first year in his professional career in which he failed to win a PGA Tour event.
______________________________
This victory was his 18th and final major title as a professional.
______________________________
Later in the year, he was paired with Tiger Woods and Vijay Singh in his final PGA Championship only a few days after the death of his 91-year-old mother,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/grieving-nicklaus-plays-to-honour-wish-of-late-mother/article18425065/ where he missed the cut by one shot.
______________________________
In a written statement, Nicklaus said that it was impossible to put into words the devastation of his family.
______________________________
He said: "It's been an overwhelmingly difficult and trying time for my entire family.
______________________________
After days of playing, Steve suggested his father return to The Masters.
______________________________
Later in 2005, Nicklaus finished his professional career at The Open Championship played at St Andrews on July 15, 2005.
______________________________
On the eighteenth fairway, he gave his final farewell to professional golf while standing on the iconic Swilken Bridge.
______________________________
He hit 20 holes-in-one in professional tournament play at other venues over his career.
______________________________

______MUSIC______
' music' ' play' ' listen' ' piano' ' violin' ' flute' ' guitar' 
Nicklaus focused on the major championshipsMasters Tournament, U.S. Open, Open Championship and PGA Championshipand played a selective schedule of regular PGA Tour events, yet still finished with 73 victories, third on the all-time list behind Sam Snead (82) and Tiger Woods (79).
______________________________
He earned his first professional win a major championship, the 1962 U.S. Open, when he defeated Palmer by three shots in a next day 18-hole  playoff.
______________________________
Between 1971 and 1980, he won an additional nine major championships, overtook Bobby Jones' record of 13 majors, and became the first player to complete double and triple career slams of golf's four professional major championships.
______________________________
Nicklaus joined the Senior PGA Tour (now known as the PGA Tour Champions)  when he became eligible in January 1990, and by April 1996 had won 10 tournaments, including eight major championships despite playing a very limited schedule.
______________________________
He continued to play at least some of the four regular Tour majors until 2005, when he made his final appearances at the Masters Tournament and The Open Championship.
______________________________
He is of German descent, the son of Helen (Schoener) (19092000)https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/12954763/nellie-helen-nicklaus and Charlie Nicklaus (1913 1970),https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/12954762/louis-charles-nicklaus a pharmacist who ran several businesses named Nicklaus Drug Store.http://www.golfchannel.com/news/golf-central-blog/know-jack-charlie-and-helen-nicklaus/ Charlie was a skilled all-round athlete who had played football for the Ohio State Buckeyes and had gone on to play semi-professional football under an assumed name for the Portsmouth Spartans (who later became the NFL's Detroit Lions).
______________________________
Nicklaus took up golf at the age of 10, scoring a 51 at Scioto Country Club for his first nine holes ever played.
______________________________
Jack Nicklaus was coached at Scioto by club pro Jack Grout, a Texas-developed contemporary of golf greats Byron Nelson and Ben Hogan; Grout had played quite successfully on the PGA Tour and would become Nicklaus' lifelong golf instructor.
______________________________
Nicklaus won the Tri-State High School Championship (Ohio/Kentucky/Indiana) at the age of 14 with a round of 68, and also recorded his first hole-in-one in tournament play the same year.
______________________________
In 1957, Nicklaus won the International Jaycee Junior Golf Tournament, having lost the previous year in a playoff.
______________________________
This was significant not only because of Coe's proven ability as a player, but also because Nicklaus became the then-youngest champion in the modern era, second only to Robert A. Gardner, who won in 1909.
______________________________
In 1961, Nicklaus became the first player to win the individual title at the NCAA Championship and the U.S.
______________________________
Nicklaus played the final 36 holes with Ben Hogan, who later remarked that he had just played 36 holes with a kid who should have won by 10 shots.
______________________________
Nicklaus had led by two shots with six holes to play.
______________________________
He tied for fourth in the 1961 U.S. Open, three shots behind champion Gene Littler, having played the final 54 holes one under par.
______________________________
When McCormack described Nicklaus, Lawrence referred to the "large, strong, and blond" player as "the Golden Bear," a nickname that would become synonymous with Nicklaus throughout his professional life.
______________________________
As mentioned above, Nicklaus played on several Golden Bear athletic teams, including captaining its 1956 state-champion golf squad, suggesting that McCormack may have adopted the name through Nicklaus' high school affiliation.
______________________________
Nicklaus won his first PGA tournament in his 17th start, when he defeated  Arnold Palmer in a Sunday playoff at Oakmont for the 1962 U.S. Open; Nicklaus earned $17,500 for his efforts.
______________________________
The galleries were more vocal in their support for Palmerwho had grown up in nearby Latrobebut Nicklaus won the playoff by three shots (71 to 74).
______________________________
Earlier in 1963, Nicklaus injured his left hip playing an approach shot from the roughan injury that would manifest itself years later.
______________________________
Ironically, Nicklaus credits this injury with assisting him in altering his swing heading into the 1963 Masters, thus allowing him to play a draw more easily.
______________________________
Golf was growing rapidly in popularity and media coverage during the early 1960s, led by the performances of these three star players.
______________________________
It was of this round that Nicklaus said, "I had never before and have never since played quite as fine a complete round of golf in a major championship as I did in the third round of the 1965 Masters".
______________________________
It was at this time that Bobby Jones stated Nicklaus played a game with which he was unfamiliar; Jones called Nicklaus' result "the greatest performance in all of golfing history."
______________________________
He won in an 18-hole playoff over Gay Brewer (Brewer had three-putted the 18th green to force the playoff) and Tommy Jacobs by shooting a two-under-par 70.
______________________________
This win made him the youngest player, age 26 (his fifth year on Tour), and the only one after Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, and Gary Player (until Tiger Woods at age 24 in 2000, also during his fifth year on Tour) to win all four major championships, now known as the Career Slam.
______________________________
Nicklaus concluded 1966 playing 22 official worldwide events, with four victories, four runners-up, 14 top-5 finishes, 16 top-10 finishes, and zero missed cuts.
______________________________
Nicklaus and Palmer were the only two players to break par for the week.
______________________________
"https://www.ebay.com/itm/SI-Sports-Illustrated-June-26-1967-Jack-Nicklaus-Breaks-the-Open-Record-G-/361470599668 He also finished runner up in The Open Championship and third in the PGA Championship, one shot out of a playoff between Don January and Don Massengale.
______________________________
Five months after this, Nicklaus won the 1970 Open Championship under difficult scoring conditions in Scotland where the wind howled up to 56 MPH, defeating fellow American Doug Sanders in an 18-hole playoff round in emotional fashion.
______________________________
On the 18th hole of the playoff, Nicklaus drove about 380 yards, through the par-4 green with a three-wood, and was forced to pitch back to the hole.
______________________________
He describes this period in his life:
I was playing good golf, but it really wasn't that big a deal to me one way or the other.
______________________________
Although Nicklaus' performance had declined somewhat during this period, he was still ranked as the #1 player in the world, for 10 straight years, beginning in 1968, on the McCormack's World Golf Rankings, which were introduced that year by sports agent Mark McCormack.
______________________________
In this championship, Nicklaus was the only player to break 70 consecutively in the first two rounds under windy conditions; he finished at seven-under par 281.
______________________________
For the record, Nicklaus played in 23 official worldwide events in 1971, won eight, had 17 top-5 finishes, 20 top-10 finishes, and compiled a 510 record in that year's Ryder Cup competition.
______________________________
He was the only player under par for the week as he and the field battled difficult scoring conditions.
______________________________
This victory was also Nicklaus' 11th professional major, tying him with Walter Hagen, and made him the first player to win the U.S.
______________________________
When he won the 1973 Ohio King's Island Open, he became the first PGA Tour player to win a Tour event on a course that he designed himself.
______________________________
Nicklaus was also the first player to win over $300,000.00 in official money for a single season in 1972 at $320,542; he eclipsed that threshold again the following year with $308,362.
______________________________
The latter total for the year 1973 catapulted Nicklaus over the $2million career PGA Tour earnings mark, making him the first player to reach that milestone.
______________________________
Having won the Masters and PGA Championship, Nicklaus missed a playoff for the U.S. Open by two shots and a playoff for Open Championship by one shot.
______________________________
Nicklaus placed first on the PGA Tour money list again in 1976, despite competing in only 16 events, winning just two (Tournament Players Championship and World Series of Golf)  neither of them majors  and playing what he called "hang-back-and-hope golf".
______________________________
The following year, 1977, was also majorless for Nicklaus, but he did achieve four top-10 finishes in the four events inclusive of two second and one third-place finish  this being one shot out of the PGA Championship playoff between Lanny Wadkins and Gene Littler.
______________________________
Nicklaus would later say:
There are those in golf who would argue into next month that the final two rounds of the 1977 British Open were the greatest head-to-head golf match ever played.
______________________________
He also became the first player to amass over $3million in official PGA Tour earnings.
______________________________
The major change was expanding selection procedures to include players from the European Tournament Players' Division, and "that European Members be entitled to play on the team."
______________________________
This meant that professional players on the European Tournament Players' Division, the forerunner to the European Tour we have today, from continental Europe would be eligible to play in the Ryder Cup.
______________________________
====Achieves triple career grand slam (1978)====
When Nicklaus won the 1978 Open Championship at St. Andrews, he became the only player to win each major championship three times.
______________________________
Nicklaus and Woods are the only two players to win three "Career Grand Slams".
______________________________
Nicklaus considered his performance in the 1978 Open as the finest four days of tee-to-green golf he had ever produced, and was most proud that the win came at St. Andrews, his favorite place to play golf.
______________________________
One of those wins came in the Jackie Gleason-Inverrary Classic, where he played the final 36 holes 13 under par and scored five consecutive birdies over the closing holes in the final round.
______________________________
===Wins fourth U.S. Open, fifth PGA Championship (1980)===
In 1980, Nicklaus recorded only four top-10 finishes in 14 events, but two of these were record-setting victories in majors (the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship); the other two were a tie for fourth in The Open Championship and a runner-up finish in the Doral-Eastern Open to Raymond Floyd via his chip-in birdie on the second hole of a sudden-death playoff.
______________________________
That record, while since having been tied by three other players, stood until Rory McIlroy's 268 in winning the 2011 US Open.
______________________________
Nicklaus opened with a record-tying 63 in round one and fought off his playing partner of all four rounds, 1978 Colgate World Match Play Championship winner, Isao Aoki.
______________________________
Each player birdied the final two holes for a dramatic finish.
______________________________
This was followed by three successive rounds in the 60s over the difficult course, and he was the only player to break par for 72 holes.
______________________________
This victory also made Nicklaus the only player since Gene Sarazen in 1922 and Ben Hogan in 1948 to win the U.S. Open and PGA Championship the same year (subsequently equaled by Tiger Woods in 2000).
______________________________
He won only twice on the PGA Tour during this period, the Colonial National Invitation in 1982 and his own Memorial Tournament in 1984 for the second time, defeating Andy Bean in a sudden-death playoff to become the tournament's first repeat champion.
______________________________
In 1983, Nicklaus closed out the PGA Championship and World Series of Golf with brilliant final rounds in the mid-60's, and passed many players to move into contention, but finished runner-up in each to Player of the Year Hal Sutton and Nick Price, respectively, who dominated the tournaments from start to finish.
______________________________
Despite not winning a PGA Tour event in 1983, Nicklaus finished 10th on the PGA Tour money list, and passed a significant milestone by becoming the first player to eclipse the $4million level in career earnings.
______________________________
These seven runner-up finishes came over the course of 21 eventsor one second-place finish for every three tournaments playedand does not include a third-place finish in 1983, one shot out of the playoff between John Cook and Johnny Miller.
______________________________
He completed his competition as a player in style by contributing a perfect 400 record (inclusive of a 5 & 3 anchor singles match win over Eamonn Darcy) in 1981, and captained the United States team in 1983 to a one-point win over Europe.
______________________________
Nicklaus made a solid par-4 at the 72nd hole, and waited for the succeeding players, several of whom (Tom Kite, Greg Norman) were still in contention, to fall short.
______________________________
Nicklaus played the final ten holes seven under par, with six birdies and an eagle.
______________________________
Nicklaus' five-under par 283 is the lowest 72-hole score in the Masters by a player older than fifty.
______________________________
He also placed third nine times and fourth seven times in this span and was one stroke out of a playoff on five of those occasions (1963 Open Championship, 1967 PGA Championship, 1975 Open Championship, 1977 PGA Championship, and 1979 Masters Tournament).
______________________________
Trouble is, I want to play like meand I can't play like me anymore."
______________________________
The next year, in 1991, Nicklaus won three of the five events he started in, those being the U.S. Senior Open at Oakland Hills by firing a 65 in a playoff against Chi-Chi Rodrguez and his fine round of 69, the PGA Seniors Championship and The Tradition for the second year straight.
______________________________
However, he never played in that event until after he turned 60, and it was only elevated to a major in 2003.
______________________________
==Close of playing career==
In 2000, Nicklaus played in his final U.S. Open.
______________________________
Nicklaus played without much preparation in the 2005 Masters, a month after the drowning death of his 17-month-old grandson Jake (child of his son Steve) on March 1, 2005.
______________________________
Nicklaus and his son Steve played golf as therapy for their grief following Jake's death.
______________________________
After days of playing, Steve suggested his father return to The Masters.
______________________________
Later in 2005, Nicklaus finished his professional career at The Open Championship played at St Andrews on July 15, 2005.
______________________________
Nicklaus turned 65 in January that year, which was the last year he could enter The Open Championship as an exempt player.
______________________________
He played with Luke Donald and Tom Watson in his final round.
______________________________
The last competitive tournament in which Nicklaus played in the United States was the Champions Tour's Bayer Advantage Classic in Overland Park, Kansas, on June 13, 2005.
______________________________
On April 8, 2015, Nicklaus hit his first-ever hole-in-one at the Augusta National Golf Club at the age of 75 when participating in the Masters' Par 3 Contest, albeit on the Par 3 Course, while playing with Gary Player and Ben Crenshaw.
______________________________
He hit 20 holes-in-one in professional tournament play at other venues over his career.
______________________________
His first design, Harbour Town Golf Links, co-credited with Dye, was opened for play in 1969.
______________________________
His first solo design, Glen Abbey Golf Course in Oakville, Ontario, opened for play in 1976.
______________________________
The company had 299 courses open for play at the end of 2005, which was nearly 1% of all the courses in the world (In 2005 ''Golf Digest'' calculated that there were nearly 32,000 golf courses in the world, approximately half of them in the United States.).
______________________________
The event is played at Muirfield Village, a course that he co-designed with Desmond Muirhead and opened in 1974.
______________________________
The honoree is selected by the Captain's Club, a group that acts independently of the tournament organization, but also advises on player invitations and the general conduct of the event.
______________________________
The Nicklauses established "The Jake", a pro-am golf tournament played annually at The Bear's Club in Jupiter, Florida in honor of their 17-month-old grandson who drowned in a hot tub in 2005.
______________________________
In announcing his donation of services (valued at $500,000), Nicklaus said, "I was moved to see the amazing efforts at American Lake Veterans Golf Course where our wounded warriors learn to play golf with the help of an incredible army of volunteers."
______________________________
The young golfer was right-handed but played left-handed; although he was showing considerable promise as a left-hander, he had been told that he might be an even better player if he switched to right-handed play.
______________________________
He wrote Nicklaus asking for advice; Nicklaus immediately wrote back telling him not to change if he was comfortable playing left-handed.
______________________________
The young Canadian, Mike Weir, decided to stay with left-handed play, and eventually became a Masters champion.
______________________________
Another factor in this decision was his distance capabilities, which were developed enough to allow him to play a fade and still reach long par fours and par fives in two shots.
______________________________
Indeed, Nicklaus remained in the top six of this category through 1985  far past his best playing years.
______________________________
Nicklaus needed a birdie, but the hole was framed by tall fescue rough, and was playing downwind with very firm turf conditions.
______________________________
Nicklaus was the first player to chart and document yardages on the course on a consistent, planned basis.
______________________________
For most of his career, he was not known for his skill on touch shots with the wedges, so he would often play to avoid wedge shots that needed less-than-full swings.
______________________________
He was also known as a conservative player at times; he went for broke only when it was necessary.
______________________________
Nicklaus had the rare privilege of "dotting the 'i'" of "Script Ohio", the signature formation of the Ohio State University Marching Band, at the Ohio State homecoming game on October 28, 2006 when the Buckeyes played Minnesota; this is considered the greatest honor that can be bestowed on a non-band member.
______________________________
He played on six Ryder Cup teams, captained the team twice and the Presidents Cup team four times, and topped the PGA Tour money list and scoring average eight times each.

______HEALTH ISSUES______

Nicklaus led the PGA Tour money list again in 1965 by a healthy margin over Tony Lema.
______________________________
===Short slump and revamping===
In 1979, Nicklaus suffered a lapse of form and did not win a tournament.

This fund assists in ensuring Central Ohio continues to have one of the best children's hospitals in the United States.
______________________________
Nicklaus and wife Barbara serve as honorary chairman and active chairwoman of the Nicklaus Children's Health Care Foundation in North Palm Beach, Florida which provides valuable programs and services to more than 4,000 hospitalized children and their families, free of charge, through Child Life programs, the Pediatric Oncology Support Team, and the Safe Kids program.
______________________________

______SPORTS______
' play' ' sport' 
Nicklaus focused on the major championshipsMasters Tournament, U.S. Open, Open Championship and PGA Championshipand played a selective schedule of regular PGA Tour events, yet still finished with 73 victories, third on the all-time list behind Sam Snead (82) and Tiger Woods (79).
______________________________
He earned his first professional win a major championship, the 1962 U.S. Open, when he defeated Palmer by three shots in a next day 18-hole  playoff.
______________________________
Between 1971 and 1980, he won an additional nine major championships, overtook Bobby Jones' record of 13 majors, and became the first player to complete double and triple career slams of golf's four professional major championships.
______________________________
Nicklaus joined the Senior PGA Tour (now known as the PGA Tour Champions)  when he became eligible in January 1990, and by April 1996 had won 10 tournaments, including eight major championships despite playing a very limited schedule.
______________________________
He continued to play at least some of the four regular Tour majors until 2005, when he made his final appearances at the Masters Tournament and The Open Championship.
______________________________
He is of German descent, the son of Helen (Schoener) (19092000)https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/12954763/nellie-helen-nicklaus and Charlie Nicklaus (1913 1970),https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/12954762/louis-charles-nicklaus a pharmacist who ran several businesses named Nicklaus Drug Store.http://www.golfchannel.com/news/golf-central-blog/know-jack-charlie-and-helen-nicklaus/ Charlie was a skilled all-round athlete who had played football for the Ohio State Buckeyes and had gone on to play semi-professional football under an assumed name for the Portsmouth Spartans (who later became the NFL's Detroit Lions).
______________________________
Nicklaus took up golf at the age of 10, scoring a 51 at Scioto Country Club for his first nine holes ever played.
______________________________
Jack Nicklaus was coached at Scioto by club pro Jack Grout, a Texas-developed contemporary of golf greats Byron Nelson and Ben Hogan; Grout had played quite successfully on the PGA Tour and would become Nicklaus' lifelong golf instructor.
______________________________
Nicklaus won the Tri-State High School Championship (Ohio/Kentucky/Indiana) at the age of 14 with a round of 68, and also recorded his first hole-in-one in tournament play the same year.
______________________________
In 1957, Nicklaus won the International Jaycee Junior Golf Tournament, having lost the previous year in a playoff.
______________________________
This was significant not only because of Coe's proven ability as a player, but also because Nicklaus became the then-youngest champion in the modern era, second only to Robert A. Gardner, who won in 1909.
______________________________
In 1961, Nicklaus became the first player to win the individual title at the NCAA Championship and the U.S.
______________________________
Nicklaus played the final 36 holes with Ben Hogan, who later remarked that he had just played 36 holes with a kid who should have won by 10 shots.
______________________________
Nicklaus had led by two shots with six holes to play.
______________________________
He tied for fourth in the 1961 U.S. Open, three shots behind champion Gene Littler, having played the final 54 holes one under par.
______________________________
When McCormack described Nicklaus, Lawrence referred to the "large, strong, and blond" player as "the Golden Bear," a nickname that would become synonymous with Nicklaus throughout his professional life.
______________________________
However, another possible origination of the name derives from the high school that Nicklaus attended in Upper Arlington, Ohio, which uses the mascot the Golden Bears for its sports teams.
______________________________
As mentioned above, Nicklaus played on several Golden Bear athletic teams, including captaining its 1956 state-champion golf squad, suggesting that McCormack may have adopted the name through Nicklaus' high school affiliation.
______________________________
Nicklaus won his first PGA tournament in his 17th start, when he defeated  Arnold Palmer in a Sunday playoff at Oakmont for the 1962 U.S. Open; Nicklaus earned $17,500 for his efforts.
______________________________
The galleries were more vocal in their support for Palmerwho had grown up in nearby Latrobebut Nicklaus won the playoff by three shots (71 to 74).
______________________________
Earlier in 1963, Nicklaus injured his left hip playing an approach shot from the roughan injury that would manifest itself years later.
______________________________
Ironically, Nicklaus credits this injury with assisting him in altering his swing heading into the 1963 Masters, thus allowing him to play a draw more easily.
______________________________
Golf was growing rapidly in popularity and media coverage during the early 1960s, led by the performances of these three star players.
______________________________
Palmer's charging style and popularity with the galleries made him the world's most marketable sports figure.
______________________________
This association was the start of the agency that became known as International Management Group, and IMG, after building a base in golf management, eventually expanded into other sports.
______________________________
It was of this round that Nicklaus said, "I had never before and have never since played quite as fine a complete round of golf in a major championship as I did in the third round of the 1965 Masters".
______________________________
It was at this time that Bobby Jones stated Nicklaus played a game with which he was unfamiliar; Jones called Nicklaus' result "the greatest performance in all of golfing history."
______________________________
He won in an 18-hole playoff over Gay Brewer (Brewer had three-putted the 18th green to force the playoff) and Tommy Jacobs by shooting a two-under-par 70.
______________________________
This win made him the youngest player, age 26 (his fifth year on Tour), and the only one after Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, and Gary Player (until Tiger Woods at age 24 in 2000, also during his fifth year on Tour) to win all four major championships, now known as the Career Slam.
______________________________
Nicklaus concluded 1966 playing 22 official worldwide events, with four victories, four runners-up, 14 top-5 finishes, 16 top-10 finishes, and zero missed cuts.
______________________________
Nicklaus and Palmer were the only two players to break par for the week.
______________________________
"https://www.ebay.com/itm/SI-Sports-Illustrated-June-26-1967-Jack-Nicklaus-Breaks-the-Open-Record-G-/361470599668 He also finished runner up in The Open Championship and third in the PGA Championship, one shot out of a playoff between Don January and Don Massengale.
______________________________
Five months after this, Nicklaus won the 1970 Open Championship under difficult scoring conditions in Scotland where the wind howled up to 56 MPH, defeating fellow American Doug Sanders in an 18-hole playoff round in emotional fashion.
______________________________
On the 18th hole of the playoff, Nicklaus drove about 380 yards, through the par-4 green with a three-wood, and was forced to pitch back to the hole.
______________________________
He describes this period in his life:
I was playing good golf, but it really wasn't that big a deal to me one way or the other.
______________________________
Although Nicklaus' performance had declined somewhat during this period, he was still ranked as the #1 player in the world, for 10 straight years, beginning in 1968, on the McCormack's World Golf Rankings, which were introduced that year by sports agent Mark McCormack.
______________________________
In this championship, Nicklaus was the only player to break 70 consecutively in the first two rounds under windy conditions; he finished at seven-under par 281.
______________________________
For the record, Nicklaus played in 23 official worldwide events in 1971, won eight, had 17 top-5 finishes, 20 top-10 finishes, and compiled a 510 record in that year's Ryder Cup competition.
______________________________
He was the only player under par for the week as he and the field battled difficult scoring conditions.
______________________________
This victory was also Nicklaus' 11th professional major, tying him with Walter Hagen, and made him the first player to win the U.S.
______________________________
When he won the 1973 Ohio King's Island Open, he became the first PGA Tour player to win a Tour event on a course that he designed himself.
______________________________
Nicklaus was also the first player to win over $300,000.00 in official money for a single season in 1972 at $320,542; he eclipsed that threshold again the following year with $308,362.
______________________________
The latter total for the year 1973 catapulted Nicklaus over the $2million career PGA Tour earnings mark, making him the first player to reach that milestone.
______________________________
Having won the Masters and PGA Championship, Nicklaus missed a playoff for the U.S. Open by two shots and a playoff for Open Championship by one shot.
______________________________
Nicklaus placed first on the PGA Tour money list again in 1976, despite competing in only 16 events, winning just two (Tournament Players Championship and World Series of Golf)  neither of them majors  and playing what he called "hang-back-and-hope golf".
______________________________
The following year, 1977, was also majorless for Nicklaus, but he did achieve four top-10 finishes in the four events inclusive of two second and one third-place finish  this being one shot out of the PGA Championship playoff between Lanny Wadkins and Gene Littler.
______________________________
Nicklaus would later say:
There are those in golf who would argue into next month that the final two rounds of the 1977 British Open were the greatest head-to-head golf match ever played.
______________________________
He also became the first player to amass over $3million in official PGA Tour earnings.
______________________________
The major change was expanding selection procedures to include players from the European Tournament Players' Division, and "that European Members be entitled to play on the team."
______________________________
This meant that professional players on the European Tournament Players' Division, the forerunner to the European Tour we have today, from continental Europe would be eligible to play in the Ryder Cup.
______________________________
====Achieves triple career grand slam (1978)====
When Nicklaus won the 1978 Open Championship at St. Andrews, he became the only player to win each major championship three times.
______________________________
Nicklaus and Woods are the only two players to win three "Career Grand Slams".
______________________________
Nicklaus considered his performance in the 1978 Open as the finest four days of tee-to-green golf he had ever produced, and was most proud that the win came at St. Andrews, his favorite place to play golf.
______________________________
One of those wins came in the Jackie Gleason-Inverrary Classic, where he played the final 36 holes 13 under par and scored five consecutive birdies over the closing holes in the final round.
______________________________
===Wins fourth U.S. Open, fifth PGA Championship (1980)===
In 1980, Nicklaus recorded only four top-10 finishes in 14 events, but two of these were record-setting victories in majors (the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship); the other two were a tie for fourth in The Open Championship and a runner-up finish in the Doral-Eastern Open to Raymond Floyd via his chip-in birdie on the second hole of a sudden-death playoff.
______________________________
That record, while since having been tied by three other players, stood until Rory McIlroy's 268 in winning the 2011 US Open.
______________________________
Nicklaus opened with a record-tying 63 in round one and fought off his playing partner of all four rounds, 1978 Colgate World Match Play Championship winner, Isao Aoki.
______________________________
Each player birdied the final two holes for a dramatic finish.
______________________________
This was followed by three successive rounds in the 60s over the difficult course, and he was the only player to break par for 72 holes.
______________________________
This victory also made Nicklaus the only player since Gene Sarazen in 1922 and Ben Hogan in 1948 to win the U.S. Open and PGA Championship the same year (subsequently equaled by Tiger Woods in 2000).
______________________________
He won only twice on the PGA Tour during this period, the Colonial National Invitation in 1982 and his own Memorial Tournament in 1984 for the second time, defeating Andy Bean in a sudden-death playoff to become the tournament's first repeat champion.
______________________________
In 1983, Nicklaus closed out the PGA Championship and World Series of Golf with brilliant final rounds in the mid-60's, and passed many players to move into contention, but finished runner-up in each to Player of the Year Hal Sutton and Nick Price, respectively, who dominated the tournaments from start to finish.
______________________________
Despite not winning a PGA Tour event in 1983, Nicklaus finished 10th on the PGA Tour money list, and passed a significant milestone by becoming the first player to eclipse the $4million level in career earnings.
______________________________
These seven runner-up finishes came over the course of 21 eventsor one second-place finish for every three tournaments playedand does not include a third-place finish in 1983, one shot out of the playoff between John Cook and Johnny Miller.
______________________________
He completed his competition as a player in style by contributing a perfect 400 record (inclusive of a 5 & 3 anchor singles match win over Eamonn Darcy) in 1981, and captained the United States team in 1983 to a one-point win over Europe.
______________________________
Nicklaus made a solid par-4 at the 72nd hole, and waited for the succeeding players, several of whom (Tom Kite, Greg Norman) were still in contention, to fall short.
______________________________
Nicklaus played the final ten holes seven under par, with six birdies and an eagle.
______________________________
On the feat, sports columnist Thomas Boswell remarked,
Some things cannot possibly happen, because they are both too improbable and too perfect.
______________________________
Nicklaus' five-under par 283 is the lowest 72-hole score in the Masters by a player older than fifty.
______________________________
He also placed third nine times and fourth seven times in this span and was one stroke out of a playoff on five of those occasions (1963 Open Championship, 1967 PGA Championship, 1975 Open Championship, 1977 PGA Championship, and 1979 Masters Tournament).
______________________________
Trouble is, I want to play like meand I can't play like me anymore."
______________________________
The next year, in 1991, Nicklaus won three of the five events he started in, those being the U.S. Senior Open at Oakland Hills by firing a 65 in a playoff against Chi-Chi Rodrguez and his fine round of 69, the PGA Seniors Championship and The Tradition for the second year straight.
______________________________
However, he never played in that event until after he turned 60, and it was only elevated to a major in 2003.
______________________________
==Close of playing career==
In 2000, Nicklaus played in his final U.S. Open.
______________________________
Nicklaus played without much preparation in the 2005 Masters, a month after the drowning death of his 17-month-old grandson Jake (child of his son Steve) on March 1, 2005.
______________________________
Nicklaus and his son Steve played golf as therapy for their grief following Jake's death.
______________________________
After days of playing, Steve suggested his father return to The Masters.
______________________________
Later in 2005, Nicklaus finished his professional career at The Open Championship played at St Andrews on July 15, 2005.
______________________________
Nicklaus turned 65 in January that year, which was the last year he could enter The Open Championship as an exempt player.
______________________________
He played with Luke Donald and Tom Watson in his final round.
______________________________
The last competitive tournament in which Nicklaus played in the United States was the Champions Tour's Bayer Advantage Classic in Overland Park, Kansas, on June 13, 2005.
______________________________
On April 8, 2015, Nicklaus hit his first-ever hole-in-one at the Augusta National Golf Club at the age of 75 when participating in the Masters' Par 3 Contest, albeit on the Par 3 Course, while playing with Gary Player and Ben Crenshaw.
______________________________
He hit 20 holes-in-one in professional tournament play at other venues over his career.
______________________________
His first design, Harbour Town Golf Links, co-credited with Dye, was opened for play in 1969.
______________________________
His first solo design, Glen Abbey Golf Course in Oakville, Ontario, opened for play in 1976.
______________________________
The company had 299 courses open for play at the end of 2005, which was nearly 1% of all the courses in the world (In 2005 ''Golf Digest'' calculated that there were nearly 32,000 golf courses in the world, approximately half of them in the United States.).
______________________________
The event is played at Muirfield Village, a course that he co-designed with Desmond Muirhead and opened in 1974.
______________________________
The honoree is selected by the Captain's Club, a group that acts independently of the tournament organization, but also advises on player invitations and the general conduct of the event.
______________________________
The Nicklauses established "The Jake", a pro-am golf tournament played annually at The Bear's Club in Jupiter, Florida in honor of their 17-month-old grandson who drowned in a hot tub in 2005.
______________________________
In announcing his donation of services (valued at $500,000), Nicklaus said, "I was moved to see the amazing efforts at American Lake Veterans Golf Course where our wounded warriors learn to play golf with the help of an incredible army of volunteers."
______________________________

Golf was last an Olympic sport at the 1904 Games in St. Louis, Mo.
______________________________
On May 19, 2014, the United States House of Representatives voted to pass {{USBill|113|HR|2203}}, a bill that would award Nicklaus the Congressional Gold Medal "in recognition of his service to the nation in promoting excellence and good sportsmanship."
