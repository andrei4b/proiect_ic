Nolan prefers not to use a mobile phone or an email address, saying, "It's not that I'm a Luddite and don't like technology; I've just never been interested [...] When I moved to Los Angeles in 1997, nobody really had cell phones, and I just never went down that path."

' multilingual' ' language' ' speak' ' foreign'

______________________________
Discussing ''The Tree of Life'' (2011), Nolan spoke of Terrence Malick's work and how it has influenced his own approach to style, "When you think of a visual style, when you think of the visual language of a film, there tends to be a natural separation of the visual style and the narrative elements.

He was also influenced by the visual language of the film ''Pink Floyd  The Wall'' (1982) and the structure of ''Pulp Fiction'' (1994), stating that he was "fascinated with what Tarantino had done".

Nolan is also an advocate for the importance of films being shown in large-screen cinema theaters as opposed to home video formats, as he believes that, "The theatrical window is to the movie business what live concerts are to the music business{{snd}}and no one goes to a concert to be played an MP3 on a bare stage."
______________________________
In order to combat this, Nolan believes the industry needs to focus on improving the theatrical experience with bigger and more beautiful presentation formats that cannot be accessed or reproduced in the home, as well as embracing the new generation of aspiring young innovative filmmakers.
______________________________
Nicolas Roeg said of Nolan, "[His] films have a magic to them{{nbsp}}... People talk about 'commercial art' and the term is usually self-negating; Nolan works in the commercial arena and yet there's something very poetic about his work."

______________________________
Nolan's major concern is that the film industry's adoption of digital formats has been driven purely by economic factors as opposed to digital being a superior medium to film, saying, "I think, truthfully, it boils down to the economic interest of manufacturers and [a production] industry that makes more money through change rather than through maintaining the status quo."
