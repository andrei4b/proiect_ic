After divorcing Mottola, Carey adopted a new image and incorporated more elements of hip hop into her music with the release of ''Butterfly'' (1997).
______________________________
After a relatively unsuccessful period, she returned to the top of music charts with ''The Emancipation of Mimi'' (2005).

Throughout her career, Carey has sold more than 200 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.
______________________________
In 2012, she was ranked second on VH1's list of the 100 greatest female artists in music history.
______________________________
Carey's name was derived from the song "They Call the Wind Maria", originally from the 1951 Broadway musical ''Paint Your Wagon.''
______________________________
By the age of four, Carey recalled that she had begun to sneak the radio under her covers at night, and just sing and try to find peace within the music.
______________________________
During elementary school, she excelled in subjects that she enjoyed, such as music, art, and literature, but did not find interest in others.
______________________________
Carey excelled in her music, and demonstrated usage of the whistle register, though only beginning to master and control it through her training with her mother.
______________________________
They needed an assistant who could play the keyboard: "We called someone and he couldn't come, so by accident we stumbled upon Ben [Margulies].
______________________________
Ben came to the studio, and he really couldn't play the keyboards very well  he was really more of a drummer  but after that day, we kept in touch, and we sort of clicked as writers."
______________________________
While requiring work to pay for her rent, Carey still had musical ambitions, as she continued working late into the night with Margulies in hopes of completing a demo.
______________________________
After completing her four song demo tape, Carey attempted to pass it to music labels, but failed each time.

However, when the time came to write music for ''Emotions,'' Sony officials made it clear he would only be paid the fair amount given to co-writers on an album.
______________________________
The album was met with mixed reception from music critics; while many praised the album's pop influence and strong content, others felt that Carey made less usage of her acclaimed vocal range.
______________________________

______________________________
AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Carey's vocals as "sultrier and more controlled than ever," and heralded ''Butterfly'' as one of her "best records and illustrates that Carey continues to improve and refine her music, which makes her a rarity among her '90s peers.'"

______________________________
Titled ''Rainbow'' (1999), the album found Carey once again working with a new array of music producers and songwriters, such as Jay-Z and DJ Clue?.

Only days later, Carey began posting irregular voice notes and messages on her official website: "I'm trying to understand things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now.
______________________________
Though released in the wake of ''Glitter'' and Carey's return to the music scene, sales of ''Charmbracelet'' were moderate and the quality of Carey's vocals came under criticism.
______________________________
The Charmbracelet World Tour: An Intimate Evening with Mariah Carey, spanned North America and East Asia over three months, generally playing in smaller venues rather than arenas.
______________________________
Charmbracelet World Tour: An Intimate Evening with Mariah Carey garnered generally positive reviews from music critics and concert goers, with many complimenting the quality of Carey's live vocals, as well as the production as a whole.
______________________________
Caroline Sullivan of ''The Guardian'' defined it as "cool, focused and urban [... some of] the first Mariah Carey tunes in years which I wouldn't have to be paid to listen to again," while ''USA Today''{{'}}s Elysa Gardner wrote, "The ballads and midtempo numbers that truly reflect the renewed confidence of a songbird who has taken her shots and kept on flying."
______________________________
In support of the album, Carey embarked on her first headlining tour in three years, named The Adventures of Mimi: The Voice, The Hits, The Tour after a "Carey-centric fan's" music diary.

=== Influences ===
Carey has said that from childhood she has been influenced by Billie Holiday, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and R&B and soul musicians such as Al Green, Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight and Aretha Franklin.
______________________________
Her music contains strong influences of gospel music, and she credits The Clark Sisters, Shirley Caesar and Edwin Hawkins as the most influential in her early years.
______________________________
I grew up with this music.
______________________________
During Carey's career, her vocal and musical style, along with her level of success, has been compared to Whitney Houston, who she has also cited as an influence, and Celine Dion.
______________________________
Carey's musical transition and use of more revealing clothing during the late 1990s were, in part, initiated to distance herself from this image, and she subsequently said that most of her early work was "schmaltzy MOR."
______________________________
She has said that much of her work is partly autobiographical, but ''Time'' magazine wrote: "If only Mariah Carey's music had the drama of her life.
______________________________

______________________________
Many of her songs contain piano-driven melodies, as she was given piano lessons when she was six years old.

______________________________
While Carey learned to play the piano at a young age, and incorporates several ranges of production and instrumentation into her music, she has maintained that her voice has always been her most important asset: "My voice is my instrument; it always has been."
______________________________
Her sense of pitch is admired and Jon Pareles adds "she can linger over sensual turns, growl with playful confidence, syncopate like a scat singer... with startlingly exact pitch."
______________________________
== Impact ==
thumb|left|upright|Carey performing "[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero" live during the Neighborhood Inaugural Ball for President Obama]]
Carey's vocal style and singing ability have significantly impacted popular and contemporary music.
______________________________
As music critic G. Brown from ''The Denver Post'' wrote, "For better or worse, Mariah Carey's five-octave range and melismatic style have influenced a generation of pop singers."
______________________________
Jody Rosen of ''Slate'' wrote of Carey's influence in modern music, calling her the most influential vocal stylist of the last two decades, the person who made rococo melismatic singing.
______________________________
Rosen further exemplified Carey's influence by drawing parallel with American Idol, which to her, "often played out as a clash of melisma-mad Mariah wannabes.
______________________________
''New York Magazine's'' editor Roger Deckker said that in regarding Carey as an influential artist in music, he commented that "Whitney Houston may have introduced melisma (the vocally acrobatic style of lending a word an extra syllable or twenty) to the charts, but it was Mariahwith her jaw-dropping rangewho made it into America's default sound."
______________________________
Beyonc credits Carey's singing and her song "Vision of Love" as influencing her to begin practicing vocal "runs" as a child, as well as helping her pursue a career as a musician.
______________________________
According to Pier Dominguez, author of ''Christina Aguilera: A star is made'', Aguilera has stated how she loved listening to Whitney Houston, but it was Carey who had the biggest influence on her vocal styling.
______________________________
And young white pop starsincluding Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson, Christina Aguilera, and 'N Synchave spent much of the past ten years making pop music that is unmistakably R&B."
______________________________
Aside from her pop culture and musical influence, Carey is credited for releasing a classic Christmas song called "All I Want for Christmas Is You."
______________________________
Carey met actor and comedian Nick Cannon while they shot her music video for her song "Bye Bye" on an island off the coast of Antigua.
______________________________
In a career spanning over 20 years, Carey has sold over 200 million records worldwide, making her one of the biggest-selling artists in music history.
