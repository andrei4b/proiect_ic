''The New Yorker'' commented that Dylan had welded a pre-rock musical sound to "some of his croakiest vocals in a while", and speculated that Dylan's intentions might be ironic: "Dylan has a long and highly publicized history with Christianity; to claim there's not a wink in the childish optimism of 'Here Comes Santa Claus' or 'Winter Wonderland' is to ignore a half-century of biting satire."

Accepting the "Tom Paine Award" from the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee shortly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, an intoxicated Dylan questioned the role of the committee, characterized the members as old and balding, and claimed to see something of himself and of every man in Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald.Part of Dylan's speech went: "There's no black and white, left and right to me any more; there's only up and down and down is very close to the ground.

By 1981, Stephen Holden wrote in the ''New York Times'' that "neither age (he's now 40) nor his much-publicized conversion to born-again Christianity has altered his essentially iconoclastic temperament."
______________________________
As an example of the latter, the ''Infidels'' recording sessions, which again employed Knopfler on lead guitar and also as the album's producer, resulted in several notable songs that Dylan left off the album.

Initially inspired by the performances of Little Richard and the songwriting of Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, and Hank Williams, Dylan has amplified and personalized musical genres.
______________________________
In his recording career, Dylan has explored many of the traditions in American songfrom folk, blues, and country to gospel, and rock and roll, and from rockabilly to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and the Great American Songbook.

Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed "the Never Ending Tour".
______________________________
In the late 1960s and early 70s, Dylan explored country music and rural themes in ''John Wesley Harding'', ''Nashville Skyline'' and ''New Morning''.
______________________________
In the late 1970s, Dylan became a born-again Christian and released a series of albums of contemporary gospel music, notably ''Slow Train Coming'', before returning to his more familiar rock-based idiom with ''Infidels''.
______________________________
Dylan has sold more than 100million records, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time.

______________________________
As an example of the latter, the ''Infidels'' recording sessions, which again employed Knopfler on lead guitar and also as the album's producer, resulted in several notable songs that Dylan left off the album.

Michael Gray wrote that the album was: "Attentively written, vocally distinctive, musically warm, and uncompromisingly professional, this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s.

On October 1, 2007, Columbia Records released the triple CD retrospective album ''Dylan'', anthologising his entire career under the ''Dylan 07'' logo.
______________________________
In a conversation with music journalist Bill Flanagan, published on Dylan's website, Dylan explained that the genesis of the record was when French film director Olivier Dahan asked him to supply a song for his new road movie, ''My Own Love Song''; initially only intending to record a single track, "Life Is Hard," "the record sort of took its own direction".
______________________________
''The New Yorker'' commented that Dylan had welded a pre-rock musical sound to "some of his croakiest vocals in a while", and speculated that Dylan's intentions might be ironic: "Dylan has a long and highly publicized history with Christianity; to claim there's not a wink in the childish optimism of 'Here Comes Santa Claus' or 'Winter Wonderland' is to ignore a half-century of biting satire."
______________________________
In an interview published in ''The Big Issue'', journalist Bill Flanagan asked Dylan why he had performed the songs in a straightforward style, and Dylan responded: "There wasn't any other way to play it.
______________________________
You have to play them straight too."
______________________________
This comprised 47 demo recordings of songs taped between 1962 and 1964 for Dylan's earliest music publishers: Leeds Music in 1962, and Witmark Music from 1962 to 1964.
______________________________
One reviewer described the set as "a hearty glimpse of young Bob Dylan changing the music business, and the world, one note at a time."
______________________________
The set was accompanied by a booklet featuring an essay by music critic Greil Marcus.

The tape was discovered in the archive of music writer Ralph J. Gleason, and the recording carries liner notes by Michael Gray, who says it captures Dylan "from way back when Kennedy was President and the Beatles hadn't yet reached America.

==Legacy==
Dylan has been described as one of the most influential figures of the 20th century, musically and culturally.
______________________________
In 2008, The Pulitzer Prize jury awarded him a special citation for "his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power."
______________________________
President Barack Obama said of Dylan in 2012, "There is not a bigger giant in the history of American music."
______________________________
For 20 years, academics lobbied the Swedish Academy to give Dylan the Nobel Prize in Literature, which awarded it to him in 2016, making Dylan the first musician to be awarded the  Literature Prize.
______________________________
I didn't have to listen to his words.
______________________________
Dylan added increasingly sophisticated lyrical techniques to the folk music of the early 1960s, infusing it "with the intellectualism of classic literature and poetry".
______________________________
Reproduced online:

When Dylan made his move from acoustic folk and blues music to a rock backing, the mix became more complex.
______________________________
Dylan is considered a seminal influence on many musical genres.
______________________________
As Edna Gundersen stated in ''USA Today'': "Dylan's musical DNA has informed nearly every simple twist of pop since 1962."
______________________________
Punk musician Joe Strummer praised Dylan for having "laid down the template for lyric, tune, seriousness, spirituality, depth of rock music."
______________________________
Other major musicians who acknowledged Dylan's importance include Johnny Cash,"I don't have to tell you who Bob Dylan isthe greatest writer of our time."
______________________________
For three weeks in Paris we didn't stop playing it.
______________________________
And he's a great writer, true to his music and done what he feels is the right thing to do for years and years and years.
______________________________
Some critics have dissented from the view of Dylan as a visionary figure in popular music.
______________________________
Fellow musicians have also presented dissenting views.
______________________________
If Dylan's work in the 1960s was seen as bringing intellectual ambition to popular music, critics in the 21st century described him as a figure who had greatly expanded the folk culture from which he initially emerged.
______________________________
When Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, ''The New York Times'' commented: "In choosing a popular musician for the literary worlds highest honor, the Swedish Academy, which awards the prize, dramatically redefined the boundaries of literature, setting off a debate about whether song lyrics have the same artistic value as poetry or novels."

______PERSONALITY______
' introvert' ' extrovert' ' lone' ' solitary' ' social' ' outsider' 
Dylan's lyrics incorporate a wide range of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences.
______________________________
68. while its lyrics questioned the social and political status quo.
______________________________
The songs often took as their subject matter contemporary stories, with "Only a Pawn in Their Game" addressing the murder of civil rights worker Medgar Evers; and the Brechtian "The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll" the death of black hotel barmaid Hattie Carroll, at the hands of young white socialite William Zantzinger.Ricks, pp.
______________________________
His newest direction was signaled by two lengthy songs: the impressionistic "Chimes of Freedom", which sets social commentary against a metaphorical landscape in a style characterized by Allen Ginsberg as "chains of flashing images,"In an interview with Seth Goddard for ''Life'' (July 5, 2001) Ginsberg said Dylan's technique had been inspired by Jack Kerouac: "(Dylan) pulled ''Mexico City Blues'' from my hand and started reading it and I said, 'What do you know about that?'
______________________________
Maymudes felt that Dylan sobering up made him "more introverted and a little less social."
______________________________
He was included in the Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century where he was called "master poet, caustic social critic and intrepid, guiding spirit of the counterculture generation".
______________________________
Drawing on folk, blues, country, R&B, rock'n'roll, gospel, British beat, symbolist, modernist and Beat poetry, surrealism and Dada, advertising jargon and social commentary, Fellini and ''Mad'' magazine, he forged a coherent and original artistic voice and vision.

As well as visiting Guthrie in hospital, Dylan befriended Guthrie's protg Ramblin' Jack Elliott.

Instead of miming, Dylan illustrated the lyrics by throwing cue cards containing key words from the song on the ground.
______________________________
I was on drugs, a lot of things... just to keep going, you know?

Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized.

Dylan confirmed this interpretation in his autobiography: "I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered.
______________________________
A Cherokee medicine man named Rolling Thunder appeared on stage at Providence, RI, "stroking a feather in time to the music".

Before the album's release Dylan was hospitalized with a life-threatening heart infection, pericarditis, brought on by histoplasmosis.
______________________________
His scheduled European tour was cancelled, but Dylan made a speedy recovery and left the hospital saying, "I really thought I'd be seeing Elvis soon.

Responses varied from the sarcasm of Irvine Welsh, who described it as "an ill conceived nostalgia award wrenched from the rancid prostates of senile, gibbering hippies", to the enthusiasm of Salman Rushdie who tweeted: "From  Orpheus to Faiz, song & poetry have been closely linked.
