' brother' ' sister' ' youngest' ' oldest' ' child' ' sibling' 
On 18 December 1879, she married Richard Pankhurst, a barrister 24 years older than she was, known for supporting women's rights to vote; they had five children over the next ten years.
______________________________
Their first son died at the age of two, but the Gouldens had ten other children; Emmeline was the eldest of five daughters.
______________________________
The youngest was Eva Gertrude Goulden.
______________________________
== Childhood ==
The Gouldens included their children in social activism.
______________________________
Sophia Goulden used the novel ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''  written by Beecher's sister Harriet Beecher Stowe  as a regular source of bedtime stories for their sons and daughters.
______________________________
Despite her avid consumption of books, however, Emmeline was not given the educational advantages enjoyed by her brothers.
______________________________
She adds: "It used to puzzle me to understand why I was under such a particular obligation to make home attractive to my brothers.
______________________________
Emmeline Goulden was so fond of Nomie and the school that after graduating she returned with her sister Mary as a parlour boarder.

During the 1880s, living at the Goulden cottage with her parents in Seedley, Emmeline Pankhurst tended to her husband and children, but still devoted time to political activities.
______________________________
Although she gave birth to five children in ten years, both she and Richard believed that she should not be "a household machine."E.
______________________________
Thus a servant was hired to help with the children as Pankhurst involved herself with the Women's Suffrage Society.
______________________________
She was soon pregnant once more and declared that the child was "Frank coming again."E.S.
______________________________
She gave birth to a son on 7 July 1889 and named him Henry Francis in honour of his deceased brother.
______________________________
Pankhurst had taken their oldest daughter Christabel to Corsier, Switzerland, to visit her old friend Nomie.

thumb|left|upright|Christabel Pankhurst, often called the favourite child, spent almost 15 years working by her mother's side for women's suffrage.
______________________________
The individual identities of the Pankhurst children began to emerge around the time of their father's death.
______________________________
The younger children, Adela and Harry, had difficulty finding a path for their studies.
______________________________
Fawcett's sister Elizabeth Garrett Anderson later resigned from the WSPU for similar reasons.Purvis 2002, pp.
______________________________
Although she was energised by the struggleand found joy in giving energy to others her constant travelling meant separation from her children, especially Christabel, who had become the national coordinator of the WSPU.
______________________________
The close connection to labour groups and Sylvia's appearance on stage with Frederick Pethick-Lawrence  who also addressed the crowd  convinced Christabel that her sister was organising a group that might challenge the WSPU in the suffrage movement.
______________________________
She urged the gathered women to follow the example of their French sisters, who  while the men fought  "are able to keep the country going, to get in the harvest, to carry on the industries".
______________________________
Another issue which concerned her greatly at the time was the plight of so-called war babies, children born to single mothers whose fathers were on the front lines.
______________________________
Pankhurst established an adoption home at Campden Hill designed to employ the Montessori method of childhood education.
______________________________
Some women criticised Pankhurst for offering relief to parents of children born out of wedlock, but she declared indignantly that the welfare of childrenwhose suffering she had seen firsthand as a Poor Law Guardianwas her only concern.
______________________________
Pankhurst herself adopted four children, whom she renamed Kathleen King, Flora Mary Gordon, Joan Pembridge and Elizabeth Tudor.
______________________________
Asked how, at the age of 57 and with no steady income, she could take on the burden of bringing up four more children, Pankhurst replied: "My dear, I wonder I didn't take forty.
______________________________
In 1922 she applied for Canadian "permission to land" (a prerequisite to status as a "British Subject with Canadian Domicile") and rented a house in Toronto, where she moved with her four adopted children.
______________________________
She had named the child Richard Keir Pethick Pankhurst, in memory of her father, her ILP comrade, and her colleagues from the WSPU respectively.
______________________________
Emmeline was further shocked to see a report from a newspaper in the US that declared that "Miss Pankhurst"  a title usually reserved for Christabel  boasted of her child being a triumph of "eugenics," since both parents were healthy and intelligent.
______________________________
Christabel and Sylvia appeared together at the service, the latter with her child.

When that organisation broke apart, she tried to join the left-leaning Independent Labour Party through her friendship with socialist Keir Hardie but was initially refused membership by the local branch on account of her sex.
______________________________
In 1913 several prominent individuals left the WSPU, among them Pankhurst's daughters Adela and Sylvia.
______________________________
Emmeline Pankhurst was born on 15 July 1858 in the Manchester suburb of Moss Side.Index to Register of births for the Chorlton registration district of Lancashire, Volume 8c (December Quarter of 1858), p. 529: the Register records her name as Emiline Goulden.
______________________________
Feeling a kinship with the female revolutionaries who stormed the Bastille, she said in 1908: "I have always thought that the fact that I was born on that day had some kind of influence over my life.
______________________________
The family into which she was born had been steeped in political agitation for generations.
______________________________
Soon after her birth the family moved to Seedley in Pendleton on the outskirts of Salford, where her father had co-founded a small business.
______________________________
Feigning sleep one evening as her father came into her bedroom, Emmeline heard him pause and say to himself: "What a pity she wasn't born a lad."
______________________________
Goulden was enthralled by Becker's address and wrote later: "I left the meeting a conscious and confirmed suffragist."E.
______________________________
Their daughter Christabel was born on 22 September 1880, less than a year after the wedding.
______________________________
Soon afterwards Richard Pankhurst left the Liberal Party.
______________________________
In 1885 the Pankhursts moved to Chorlton-on-Medlock, and their daughter Adela was born.

They moved to London the following year, where Richard ran unsuccessfully for election as a Member of Parliament and Pankhurst opened a small fabric shop called Emerson and Company.Pugh, p. 26; E.S.
______________________________
Pankhurst blamed the poor conditions of the neighbourhood, and the family moved to a more affluent middle class district at Russell Square.

______________________________
The family moved briefly to Mobberley, with the hope that country air would help his condition.
______________________________
The loss of her husband left Pankhurst with new responsibilities and a significant amount of debt.

Although she was energised by the struggleand found joy in giving energy to others her constant travelling meant separation from her children, especially Christabel, who had become the national coordinator of the WSPU.
______________________________
Around the same time, Emmeline's daughter Adela left the group.

== First World War ==
thumb|left|Emmeline Pankhurst
When the First World War began in August 1914, Emmeline and Christabel considered that the threat posed by Germany was a danger to all humanity, and that the British government needed the support of all citizens.
______________________________
Another issue which concerned her greatly at the time was the plight of so-called war babies, children born to single mothers whose fathers were on the front lines.
______________________________
Some women criticised Pankhurst for offering relief to parents of children born out of wedlock, but she declared indignantly that the welfare of childrenwhose suffering she had seen firsthand as a Poor Law Guardianwas her only concern.
______________________________
They lived in London, wherefor the first time in many yearsshe had a permanent home, at Holland Park.Bartley, pp.

Press response was divided between left and right wings; the former depicted her as a tool of capitalism, while the latter praised her devout patriotism.Purvis 2002, pp.
______________________________
Although she had been active with the socialist-leaning ILP in years past, Pankhurst had begun to see leftist politics as disagreeable, an attitude which intensified while she was in Russia.
______________________________
For years she travelled around England and North America, rallying support for the British Empire and warning audiences about the dangers of Bolshevism.Purvis 2002, pp.
______________________________
In 1922 she applied for Canadian "permission to land" (a prerequisite to status as a "British Subject with Canadian Domicile") and rented a house in Toronto, where she moved with her four adopted children.

In 2006, a blue plaque for Pankhurst and her daughter, Christabel was placed  by English Heritage at 50 Clarendon Road, Notting Hill, London W11 3AD, Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, where they had lived.
______________________________

______MULTILINGUAL______
' multilingual' ' language' ' speak' ' foreign' 
After learning that Becker would be speaking, she insisted on attending.

She soon became involved with the suffrage movement and joined her mother at speaking events.Pugh, pp.
______________________________
Police officers seized several of the speakers and pushed them into a crowd of opponents who had gathered nearby.
______________________________
In 1909, as Pankhurst planned a speaking tour of the United States, Harry was paralysed after his spinal cord became inflamed.
______________________________

______SCHOOLING______
' school' ' education' ' home' ' self' ' self taught' 
He supported her activities outside the home, and she founded and became involved with the Women's Franchise League, which advocated suffrage for both married and unmarried women.
______________________________
Despite her avid consumption of books, however, Emmeline was not given the educational advantages enjoyed by her brothers.
______________________________
Their parents believed that the girls needed most to learn the art of "making home attractive" and other skills desired by potential husbands.E.
______________________________
She adds: "It used to puzzle me to understand why I was under such a particular obligation to make home attractive to my brothers.
______________________________
We were on excellent terms of friendship, but it was never suggested to them as a duty that they make home attractive to me."
______________________________
The Gouldens deliberated carefully about future plans for their sons' education, but they expected their daughters to marry young and avoid paid work.Purvis 2002, p. 11; Bartley, pp.
______________________________
At the age of 14, she returned home from school one day to find her mother on her way to a public meeting about women's voting rights.
______________________________

______PARENTS______
' parents' ' father' ' mother' ' family' ' adopt' ' died' ' profession' ' occupation' 
Born in Moss Side, Manchester, to politically active parents, Pankhurst was introduced at the age of 14 to the women's suffrage movement.
______________________________
In 1903, five years after her husband died, Pankhurst founded the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), an all-women suffrage advocacy organisation dedicated to "deeds, not words".E.
______________________________
Eventually the group adopted arson as a tactic, and more moderate organisations spoke out against the Pankhurst family.
______________________________
Adela complied and the family rift was never healed.
______________________________
She died on 14 June 1928, only weeks before the Conservative government's Representation of the People Act (1928) extended the vote to all women over 21 years of age on 2 July 1928.
______________________________
The family into which she was born had been steeped in political agitation for generations.
______________________________
Her mother, Sophia Jane Craine, was a Manx woman from the Isle of Man and counted among her ancestors men charged with social unrest and slander.Bartley, p. 16; Liddington and Norris, p. 74.
______________________________
Her father, Robert Goulden, came from a modest Manchester merchant family with its own background of political activity.
______________________________
His mother worked with the Anti-Corn Law League, and his father was present at the Peterloo massacre, when cavalry charged and broke up a crowd demanding parliamentary reform.Bartley, pp.

Their first son died at the age of two, but the Gouldens had ten other children; Emmeline was the eldest of five daughters.
______________________________
Soon after her birth the family moved to Seedley in Pendleton on the outskirts of Salford, where her father had co-founded a small business.
______________________________
Pankhurst absorbed an appreciation of drama and theatrics from her father, which she used later in social activism.Bartley, pp.

Their parents believed that the girls needed most to learn the art of "making home attractive" and other skills desired by potential husbands.E.
______________________________
Feigning sleep one evening as her father came into her bedroom, Emmeline heard him pause and say to himself: "What a pity she wasn't born a lad."
______________________________
It was through her parents' interest in women's suffrage that Emmeline Goulden was first introduced to the subject.
______________________________
Her mother received and read the ''Women's Suffrage Journal'', and Goulden grew fond of its editor, Lydia Becker.
______________________________
At the age of 14, she returned home from school one day to find her mother on her way to a public meeting about women's voting rights.

With the family's finances in jeopardy, Richard travelled regularly to northwest England, where most of his clients were.

______________________________
During this time she also re-opened her store, with the hope that it would provide additional income for the family.Bartley, pp.

The individual identities of the Pankhurst children began to emerge around the time of their father's death.

Christabel enjoyed a privileged status among the daughters, as Sylvia noted in 1931: "She was our mother's favourite; we all knew it, and I, for one, never resented the fact."E.S.
______________________________
Christabel did not share her mother's fervour for political work, however, until she befriended the suffrage activists Esther Roper and Eva Gore-Booth.
______________________________
She soon became involved with the suffrage movement and joined her mother at speaking events.Pugh, pp.
______________________________
The painful techniques (which, in the case of mouth-feeding, required the use of steel gags to force the mouth open) brought condemnation from suffragists and medical professionals.Purvis 2002, pp.
______________________________
On her return from a successful tour, she sat by Harry's bedside as he died on 5 January 1910.
______________________________
In 1912 WSPU members adopted arson as another tactic to win the vote.
______________________________
Adela's relationship with her family  especially Christabel  was also strained as a result.Pugh, pp.
______________________________
The deepest rift in the Pankhurst family came in November 1913 when Sylvia spoke at a meeting of socialists and trade unionists in support of labour organiser Jim Larkin.
______________________________
Their mother had just returned from another tour of the US, and Sylvia had just been released from prison.
______________________________
S. Pankhurst 1931, p. 517.With their mother's blessing, Christabel ordered Sylvia's group to dissociate from the WSPU.
______________________________
When Sylvia refused, her mother switched to fierce anger in a letter:You are unreasonable, always have been &amp; I fear always will be.
______________________________
Sylvia and Adela, meanwhile, did not share their mother's enthusiasm for the war.
______________________________
Another issue which concerned her greatly at the time was the plight of so-called war babies, children born to single mothers whose fathers were on the front lines.

______________________________
Pankhurst herself adopted four children, whom she renamed Kathleen King, Flora Mary Gordon, Joan Pembridge and Elizabeth Tudor.
______________________________
While the fighting continued the Women's Party demanded no compromise in the defeat of Germany; the removal from government of anyone with family ties to Germany or pacifist attitudes; and shorter work hours to forestall labour strikes.
______________________________
In 1922 she applied for Canadian "permission to land" (a prerequisite to status as a "British Subject with Canadian Domicile") and rented a house in Toronto, where she moved with her four adopted children.
______________________________
Back in London Emmeline was visited by Sylvia, who had not seen her mother in years.
______________________________
Emmeline's adopted daughter Mary, however, remembered the meeting differently.
______________________________
The British press sometimes made light of the varied paths followed by the once indivisible family.Purvis 2002, p. 344.
______________________________
She had named the child Richard Keir Pethick Pankhurst, in memory of her father, her ILP comrade, and her colleagues from the WSPU respectively.
______________________________
Emmeline was further shocked to see a report from a newspaper in the US that declared that "Miss Pankhurst"  a title usually reserved for Christabel  boasted of her child being a triumph of "eugenics," since both parents were healthy and intelligent.
______________________________
His use of the stomach pump had helped her feel better while in prison; her nurses were sure that the shock of such treatment would severely wound her, but Christabel felt obligated to carry out her mother's request.
______________________________
On Thursday 14 June 1928 Pankhurst died, at the age of 69.Purvis 2002, pp.
______________________________
Sylvia's 1931 book ''The Suffrage Movement'' describes her mother's political shift at the start of the First World War as the beginning of a betrayal of her family (especially her father) and the movement.

By defying the roles of wife and mother as the docile companion, Pankhurst paved the way for feminists who would later decry her support for empire and sustainable social values.Bartley, pp.
