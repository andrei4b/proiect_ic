Maria Skodowska was born in Warsaw, in Congress Poland in the Russian Empire, on 7 November 1867, the fifth and youngest child of well-known teachers Bronisawa, ''ne'' Boguska, and Wadysaw Skodowski.
______________________________
The elder siblings of Maria (nicknamed ''Mania'') were Zofia (born 1862, nicknamed ''Zosia''), Jzef (born 1863, nicknamed ''Jzio''), Bronisawa (born 1865, nicknamed ''Bronia'') and Helena (born 1866, nicknamed ''Hela'').
______________________________
This condemned the subsequent generation, including Maria and her elder siblings, to a difficult struggle to get ahead in life.
______________________________
After Russian authorities eliminated laboratory instruction from the Polish schools, he brought much of the laboratory equipment home, and instructed his children in its use.
______________________________
Less than three years earlier, Maria's oldest sibling, Zofia, had died of typhus contracted from a boarder.
______________________________
The deaths of Maria's mother and sister caused her to give up Catholicism and become agnostic.
______________________________
Unable to enroll in a regular institution of higher education because she was a woman, she and her sister Bronisawa became involved with the clandestine Flying University (sometimes translated as ''Floating University''), a Polish patriotic institution of higher learning that admitted women students.

Maria made an agreement with her sister, Bronisawa, that she would give her financial assistance during Bronisawa's medical studies in Paris, in exchange for similar assistance two years later.
______________________________
In Paris, Maria (or Marie, as she would be known in France) briefly found shelter with her sister and brother-in-law before renting a garret closer to the university, in the Latin Quarter, and proceeding with her studies of physics, chemistry, and mathematics at the University of Paris, where she enrolled in late 1891.
______________________________
Fifteen years earlier, her husband and his brother had developed a version of the electrometer, a sensitive device for measuring electric charge.
______________________________
Her second American tour, in 1929, succeeded in equipping the Warsaw Radium Institute with radium; it was opened in 1932 and her sister Bronisawa became its director.

______________________________
After a collapse, possibly due to depression, she spent the following year in the countryside with relatives of her father, and the next year with her father in Warsaw, where she did some tutoring.
______________________________
She subsisted on her meager resources, suffering from cold winters and occasionally fainting from hunger.
______________________________
She was still laboring under the illusion that she would be able to work in her chosen field in Poland, but she was denied a place at Krakw University because she was a woman.
______________________________
Between 1898 and 1902, the Curies published, jointly or separately, a total of 32 scientific papers, including one that announced that, when exposed to radium, diseased, tumor-forming cells were destroyed faster than healthy cells.
______________________________
Curie and her husband declined to go to Stockholm to receive the prize in person; they were too busy with their work, and Pierre Curie, who disliked public ceremonies, was feeling increasingly ill. As Nobel laureates were required to deliver a lecture, the Curies finally undertook the trip in 1905.
______________________________
Curie's second Nobel Prize enabled her to persuade the French government into supporting the Radium Institute, built in 1914, where research was conducted in chemistry, physics, and medicine.
______________________________
A month after accepting her 1911 Nobel Prize, she was hospitalised with depression and a kidney ailment.
______________________________
Assisted at first by a military doctor and by her 17-year-old daughter Irne, Curie directed the installation of 20 mobile radiological vehicles and another 200 radiological units at field hospitals in the first year of the war.
______________________________
Only, I have no illusions: this money will probably be lost.
______________________________
Curie was also exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during the war.
______________________________
Although her many decades of exposure to radiation caused chronic illnesses (including near-blindness due to cataracts) and ultimately her death, she never really acknowledged the health risks of radiation exposure.Denise Grady (6 October 1998), [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/06/science/a-glow-in-the-dark-and-a-lesson-in-scientific-peril.html A Glow in the Dark, and a Lesson in Scientific Peril] ''The New York Times''; accessed 21 December 2016.
