'''Gaius Julius Caesar'''{{efn|The [[Classical Latin]] spelling and [[Latin spelling and pronunciation|reconstructed Classical Latin pronunciation]] of his name is Gaius Iulius Caesar, {{IPA-la|a.i.s ju.li.s kae.sar|pron}}. His titulary name was ''Imperator Gaius Iulius Gai(i) filius Gai(i) nepos Caesar Patris Patriae'' "Commander Gaius Julius Caesar, son of Gaius, grandson of Gaius, Father of his Country", {{IPA-la|m.pra.tr ga.i.s ju.li.s ga.i.i fi.li.s ga.i.i n.pos kae.sar pa.trs pa.tri.ae|pron}} (Suetonius, ''Divus Julius'' 76.1). Official name after [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|deification]] in 42&amp;nbsp;BC: ''Divus Iulius'' ("The Divine Julius").}} ({{IPAc-en||s|i|z|r}}; 12 or 13 July 100&amp;nbsp;BC&lt;ref&gt;Dates in this article are given in the [[Roman calendar]] before 1 January 45 BC, and in the Julian calendar as observed in Rome on and after that date. There is some dispute over the year of Caesar's birth. Some scholars have made a case for 101 or 102&amp;nbsp;BC as the year of his birth, based on the dates that he held certain magistracies, but scholarly consensus favors 100&amp;nbsp;BC. Similarly, some scholars prefer 12 July, but most give 13 July. Goldsworthy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oR-ljeBaWIcC&amp;pg=PA30 p. 30],  Ward, Heichelheim, &amp; Yeo [https://books.google.com/books?id=9Q83DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA194 p. 194].

See Blackburn, B and Holford-Strevens, L. (1999 corrected 2003). ''The Oxford Companion to the Year''. Oxford University Press. p. 671. {{ISBN|978-0-19-214231-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; known by his [[cognomen]] '''Julius Caesar''', was a Roman politician and military general who played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the [[Roman Republic]] and the rise of the [[Roman Empire]]. He is also known as an author of [[Latin]] prose.

In 60 BC, Caesar, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]] and [[Pompey]] formed a [[First Triumvirate|political alliance]] that dominated [[Roman politics]] for several years. Their attempts to amass power as ''[[Populares]]'' were opposed by the ''[[Optimates]]'' within the [[Roman Senate]], among them [[Cato the Younger]] with the frequent support of [[Cicero]]. Caesar rose to become one of the most powerful politicians in the Roman Republic through a number of his accomplishments, notably his victories in the [[Gallic Wars]], completed by 51&amp;nbsp;BC. During this time, Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both the Channel and the Rhine, when he built a [[Caesar's Rhine bridges|bridge across the Rhine]] and crossed the Channel to [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|invade Britain]]. Caesar's wars extended Rome's territory to the [[English Channel]] and the [[Rhine]]. These achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the [[Battle of Carrhae|death of Crassus]] in 53&amp;nbsp;BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome. Leaving his command in Gaul meant losing his immunity from being charged as a criminal for waging unsanctioned wars. As a result, Caesar found himself with no other options but to [[Caesar's Civil War#Crossing the Rubicon|cross the Rubicon]] with the [[Legio XIII Gemina|13th Legion]], leaving his province and illegally entering [[Roman Italy]] under arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keppie|first=Lawrence|title=The making of the Roman Army: from Republic to Empire|year=1998|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman, OK|isbn=978-0-8061-3014-9|page=102|chapter=The approach of civil war}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caesar's Civil War|Civil war resulted]], and Caesar's victory in the war put him in an unrivalled position of power and influence.

After assuming control of government, Caesar began a programme of social and governmental reforms, including the creation of the [[Julian calendar]]. He gave citizenship to many residents of far regions of the Roman Empire. He initiated land reform and support for veterans. He centralised the bureaucracy of the Republic and was eventually proclaimed "[[Dictator perpetuo|dictator in perpetuity]]", giving him additional authority. His populist and authoritarian reforms angered the elites, who began to conspire against him. On the [[Ides of March]] (15&amp;nbsp;March) 44&amp;nbsp;BC [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|Caesar was assassinated]] by a group of rebellious senators led by [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]], [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Marcus Junius Brutus]] and [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus|Decimus Junius Brutus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html|title=De vita Caesarum|last=Suetonius|first=|date=121|website=University of Chicago|page=107|trans-title=The Twelve Caesars|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120530163202/http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html|archive-date=2012-05-30|dead-url=yes|access-date=|quote=More than sixty joined the conspiracy against [Caesar], led by Gaius Cassius and Marcus and Decimus Brutus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/caesar*.html|title=Life of Caesar|last=Plutarch|first=|date=|website=University of Chicago|page=595|access-date=|quote=...at this juncture Decimus Brutus, surnamed Albinus, who was so trusted by Caesar that he was entered in his will as his second heir, but was partner in the conspiracy of the other Brutus and Cassius, fearing that if Caesar should elude that day, their undertaking would become known, ridiculed the seers and chided Caesar for laying himself open to malicious charges on the part of the senators...}}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new [[Roman civil wars#Late Republic|series of civil wars]] broke out and the [[Constitution of the Roman Republic|constitutional government of the Republic]] was never fully restored. Caesar's adopted heir Octavian, later known as [[Augustus]], rose to sole power after defeating his opponents in the [[Final War of the Roman Republic|civil war]]. Octavian set about solidifying his power and the era of the [[History of the Roman Empire|Roman Empire]] began.

Much of Caesar's life is known from his own accounts of his military campaigns and from other contemporary sources, mainly the letters and speeches of Cicero and the historical writings of [[Sallust]]. The later biographies of Caesar by [[Suetonius]] and [[Plutarch]] are also major sources. Caesar is considered by many historians to be one of the greatest military commanders in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Battles That Changed History: An Encyclopedia of World Conflict|author=Tucker, Spencer|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2010|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marius Glyptothek Munich 319.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gaius Marius]], Caesar's uncle]]
Caesar was born into a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] family, the ''[[gens]] [[Julia (gens)|Julia]]'', which claimed descent from [[Ascanius|Iulus]], son of the legendary [[Troy|Trojan]] prince [[Aeneas]], supposedly the son of the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Froude|first=James Anthony|authorlink=James Anthony Froude|title=Life of Caesar|publisher=Project Gutenberg e-text|year=1879|page=67|url=http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext05/8cesr10.txt|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209113843/http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext05/8cesr10.txt|archivedate=9 December 2007|df=dmy-all}} See also: Suetonius, ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'': ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#6 6]; [[Velleius Paterculus]], ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#41 2.41]; [[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The family originated from [[Alba Longa]], twenty miles south of Rome.&lt;Ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annales'', xi. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[cognomen]]'' "Caesar" originated, according to [[Pliny the Elder]], with an ancestor who was born by [[Caesarean section]] (from the Latin verb to cut, ''caedere'', ''caes-'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+7.7 7.7]. The misconception that Julius Caesar himself was born by Caesarian section dates back at least to the 10th century (''[[Suda]]'' [http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?db=REAL&amp;search_method=QUERY&amp;login=guest&amp;enlogin=guest&amp;user_list=LIST&amp;page_num=1&amp;field=adlerhw_gr&amp;searchstr=kappa%2C1199 kappa 1199]). Julius wasn't the first to bear the name, and in his time the procedure was only performed on dead women, while Caesar's mother [[Aurelia Cotta|Aurelia]] lived long after he was born.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'' suggests three [[Etymology of the name of Julius Caesar|alternative explanations]]: that the first Caesar had a thick head of hair (Latin ''caesaries''); that he had bright grey eyes (Latin ''oculis caesiis''); or that he killed an elephant (''caesai'' in Moorish) in battle.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'': ''Aelius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Aelius*.html#2 2].&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar issued coins featuring images of elephants, suggesting that he favored this interpretation of his name. 

Despite their ancient pedigree, the Julii Caesares were not especially politically influential, although they had enjoyed some revival of their political fortunes in the early 1st century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oR-ljeBaWIcC&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32].&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar's father, also called [[Gaius Julius Caesar (proconsul)|Gaius Julius Caesar]], governed the province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]],&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1]; [[Plutarch]], ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#1 1], ''Marius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Marius*.html#6 6]; Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+7.54 7.54]; ''Inscriptiones Italiae'', 13.3.5152&lt;/ref&gt; and his sister [[Julia (wife of Marius)|Julia]], Caesar's aunt, married [[Gaius Marius]], one of the most prominent figures in the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Marius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Marius*.html#6 6]&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, [[Aurelia Cotta]], came from an influential family. Little is recorded of Caesar's childhood.&lt;ref name="plutsuet1"&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#1 1]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 85 BC, Caesar's father died suddenly,&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1]; Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+7.54 7.54]&lt;/ref&gt; so Caesar was the head of the family at 16. His coming of age coincided with a [[Sulla's first civil war|civil war]] between his uncle Gaius Marius and his rival [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]]. Both sides carried out bloody purges of their political opponents whenever they were in the ascendancy. Marius and his ally [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]] were in control of the city when Caesar was nominated to be the new [[Flamen Dialis|high priest of Jupiter]],&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2A*.html#22 2.22]; Florus, ''Epitome of Roman History'' [[s:Epitome of Roman History/Book 2#9|2.9]]&lt;/ref&gt; and he was married to Cinna's daughter [[Cornelia (wife of Caesar)|Cornelia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsc.csu.edu.au/ancient_history/personalities/rome/caesar/caesar.html|title=Julius Caesar|work=|publisher=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322013940/http://hsc.csu.edu.au/ancient_history/personalities/rome/caesar/caesar.html|archivedate=22 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#1 1]; Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#41 2.41]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following Sulla's final victory, though, Caesar's connections to the old regime made him a target for the new one. He was stripped of his inheritance, his wife's dowry, and his priesthood, but he refused to divorce Cornelia and was forced to go into hiding.&lt;ref&gt;Canfora, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The threat against him was lifted by the intervention of his mother's family, which included supporters of Sulla, and the Vestal Virgins. Sulla gave in reluctantly and is said to have declared that he saw many a Marius in Caesar.&lt;ref name="plutsuet1" /&gt; Ironically, the loss of his priesthood had allowed him to pursue a military career, as the high priest of Jupiter was not permitted to touch a horse, sleep three nights outside his own bed or one night outside Rome, or look upon an army.&lt;ref&gt;William Smith, ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'': ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Flamen.html Flamen]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar felt that it would be much safer far away from Sulla should the Dictator change his mind, so he left Rome and joined the army, serving under Marcus Minucius Thermus in Asia and Servilius Isauricus in Cilicia. He served with distinction, winning the Civic Crown for his part in the Siege of Mytilene. He went on a mission to Bithynia to secure the assistance of King Nicomedes's fleet, but he spent so long at Nicomedes' court that rumours arose of an affair with the king, which Caesar vehemently denied for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#2 23]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#2 23]; [[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/43*.html#20 43.20]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hearing of Sulla's death in 78 BC, Caesar felt safe enough to return to Rome. He lacked means since his inheritance was confiscated, but he acquired a modest house in [[Subura]], a lower-class neighbourhood of Rome.&lt;ref name="suet46"&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#46 46]&lt;/ref&gt; He turned to legal advocacy and became known for his exceptional oratory accompanied by impassioned gestures and a high-pitched voice, and ruthless prosecution of former governors notorious for extortion and corruption.

[[File:Sulla Glyptothek Munich 309.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Dictator [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] stripped Caesar of the priesthood]]
On the way across the [[Aegean Sea]],&lt;ref&gt;Again, according to Suetonius's chronology (''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#4 4]). Plutarch (''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#1.8 1.82]) says this happened earlier, on his return from Nicomedes's court. Velleius Paterculus (''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#41.3 2:41.342]) says merely that it happened when he was a young man.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar was kidnapped by [[Ancient Mediterranean piracy|pirates]] and held prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#1 Plutarch, ''Caesar'']&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained an attitude of superiority throughout his captivity. The pirates demanded a ransom of 20 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] of silver, but he insisted that they ask for 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Julius Caesar: Conqueror and Dictator |author=Thorne, James |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |year=2003 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 39&lt;/ref&gt; After the ransom was paid, Caesar raised a fleet, pursued and captured the pirates, and imprisoned them. He had them crucified on his own authority, as he had promised while in captivity&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 40&lt;/ref&gt;a promise that the pirates had taken as a joke. As a sign of leniency, he first had their throats cut. He was soon called back into military action in Asia, raising a band of [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]] to repel an incursion from the east.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to Rome, he was elected military [[tribune]], a first step in a political career. He was elected ''[[quaestor]]'' for 69 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 51&lt;/ref&gt; and during that year he delivered the [[Laudatio Iuliae amitae|funeral oration for his aunt Julia]], and included images of her husband Marius in the funeral procession, unseen since the days of Sulla. His wife Cornelia also died that year.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 52&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar went to serve his quaestorship in [[Hispania|Spain]] after her funeral, in the spring or early summer of 69 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, 100&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he is said to have encountered a statue of [[Alexander the Great]], and realised with dissatisfaction that he was now at an age when Alexander had the world at his feet, while he had achieved comparatively little. On his return in 67 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, 101&lt;/ref&gt; he married [[Pompeia (wife of Julius Caesar)|Pompeia]], a granddaughter of Sulla, whom he later divorced in 61 BC after her embroilment in the [[Publius Clodius Pulcher#Bona Dea scandal and trial for incestum|Bona Dea scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#5 58]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#5 5]; Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#43 2.43]&lt;/ref&gt; In 65 BC, he was elected [[Aedile#Curule aediles|curule aedile]], and staged lavish [[Ludi|games]] that won him further attention and popular support.&lt;ref&gt;Mouritsen, Henrik, ''Plebs and Politics in the Late Roman Republic'', Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press, 2001, p 97. {{ISBN|0-521-79100-6}} For context, see Plutarch, ''Julius Caesar'', 5.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 63 BC, he ran for election to the post of ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'', chief priest of the Roman state religion. He ran against two powerful senators. Accusations of bribery were made by all sides. Caesar won comfortably, despite his opponents' greater experience and standing.&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#43 2.43]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#7 7]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#13 13]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]] was consul that year, and he exposed [[Catiline]]'s [[Second Catilinarian conspiracy|conspiracy to seize control of the republic]]; several senators accused Caesar of involvement in the plot.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sallust]], ''Catiline War'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html#49 49]&lt;/ref&gt;

After serving as ''[[praetor]]'' in 62 BC, Caesar was appointed to govern [[Hispania Ulterior]] (modern south-eastern Spain) as ''[[propraetor]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennedy |first=E.C. |year=1958 |title=Caesar de Bello Gallico |volume=III |series=Cambridge Elementary Classics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fto8AAAAIAAJ |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=10 |isbn= |accessdate= 26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hammond |first=Mason |year=1966 |title=City-state and World State in Greek and Roman Political Theory Until Augustus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ujHHZCYh2c0C |location= |publisher=Biblo &amp; Tannen |page=114 |isbn=9780819601766 |accessdate=26 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Suetonius |authorlink=Suetonius |year=2004 |title=Lives of the Caesars |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gs4DPMV7si0C |location= |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble |page=258 |others=Translated by J.

He turned to [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], one of Rome's richest men. Crassus paid some of Caesar's debts and acted as guarantor for others, in return for political support in his opposition to the interests of [[Pompey]]. Even so, to avoid becoming a private citizen and thus open to prosecution for his debts, Caesar left for his province before his praetorship had ended. In Spain, he conquered two local tribes and was hailed as ''[[imperator]]'' by his troops; he reformed the law regarding debts, and completed his governorship in high esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#11 1112]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#18 18.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar was acclaimed ''[[Imperator]]'' in 60 and 45 BC. In the Roman Republic, this was an honorary title assumed by certain military commanders. After an especially great victory, army troops in the field would proclaim their commander ''imperator'', an acclamation necessary for a general to apply to the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] for a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. However, he also wanted to stand for consul, the most senior magistracy in the republic. If he were to celebrate a triumph, he would have to remain a soldier and stay outside the city until the ceremony, but to stand for election he would need to lay down his command and enter Rome as a private citizen. He could not do both in the time available. He asked the senate for permission to stand ''in absentia'', but Cato blocked the proposal. Faced with the choice between a triumph and the consulship, Caesar chose the consulship.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#13 13]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#18.2 18.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 60 BC, Caesar sought election as consul for 59&amp;nbsp;BC, along with two other candidates. The election was sordid  even [[Cato the Younger|Cato]], with his reputation for incorruptibility, is said to have resorted to bribery in favour of one of Caesar's opponents. Caesar won, along with conservative [[Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus|Marcus Bibulus]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#13 1314]; Suetonius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#19 19]&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar was already in [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]]' political debt, but he also made overtures to [[Pompey]]. Pompey and Crassus had been at odds for a decade, so Caesar tried to reconcile them. The three of them had enough money and political influence to control public business. This informal alliance, known as the [[First Triumvirate]] ("rule of three men"), was cemented by the marriage of Pompey to Caesar's daughter [[Julia (daughter of Julius Caesar)|Julia]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Letters to Atticus'' [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.1|2.1]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.3|2.3]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.17|2.17]]; Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#44 2.44]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#13 1314], ''Pompey'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#47 47], ''Crassus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#14 14]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#19.2 19.2]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/37*.html#54 37.5458]&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar also married again, this time [[Calpurnia (wife of Caesar)|Calpurnia]], who was the daughter of another powerful senator.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#21 21]&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar proposed a law for redistributing public lands to the poorby force of arms, if need bea proposal supported by Pompey and by Crassus, making the triumvirate public. Pompey filled the city with soldiers, a move which intimidated the triumvirate's opponents. Bibulus attempted to declare the omens unfavourable and thus void the new law, but he was driven from the forum by Caesar's armed supporters. His [[lictor|bodyguards]] had their [[fasces|ceremonial axes]] broken, two high magistrates accompanying him were wounded, and he had a bucket of excrement thrown over him. In fear of his life, he retired to his house for the rest of the year, issuing occasional proclamations of bad omens. These attempts proved ineffective in obstructing Caesar's legislation. [[Roman satirists]] ever after referred to the year as "the consulship of Julius and Caesar."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Letters to Atticus'' [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.15|2.15]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.16|2.16]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.17|2.17]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.18|2.18]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.19|2.19]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.20|2.20]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/2.21|2.21]]; Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#44.4 44.4]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#14 14], ''Pompey'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#47 4748], ''Cato the Younger'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Minor*.html#32 3233]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/38*.html#1 38.18]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Caesar was first elected, the aristocracy tried to limit his future power by allotting the woods and pastures of Italy, rather than the [[proconsul|governorship]] of a province, as his military command duty after his year in office was over.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#19.2 19.2]&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of political allies, Caesar later overturned this, and was instead appointed to govern [[Cisalpine Gaul]] (northern Italy) and [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] (southeastern Europe), with [[Transalpine Gaul]] (southern France) later added, giving him command of four legions. The term of his governorship, and thus his immunity from prosecution, was set at five years, rather than the usual one.&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#44.4 2:44.4]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#14.10 14.10], ''Crassus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#14.3 14.3], ''Pompey'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#48 48], ''Cato the Younger'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Minor*.html#33.3 33.3]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#22 22]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/38*.html#8.5 38:8.5]&lt;/ref&gt; When his consulship ended, Caesar narrowly avoided prosecution for the irregularities of his year in office, and quickly left for his province.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#23 23]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conquest of Gaul===
{{Main|Gallic Wars}}
[[File:RomanRepublic40BC.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.6|The extent of the Roman Republic in 40 BC after Caesar's conquests]]
Caesar was still deeply in debt, but there was money to be made as a governor, whether by extortion&lt;ref&gt;See Cicero's speeches [[s:Against Verres|against Verres]] for an example of a former provincial governor successfully prosecuted for illegally enriching himself at his province's expense.&lt;/ref&gt; or by military adventurism. Caesar had four legions under his command, two of his provinces bordered on unconquered territory, and parts of [[Gaul]] were known to be unstable. Some of Rome's Gallic allies had been defeated by their rivals at the [[Battle of Magetobriga]], with the help of a contingent of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes. The Romans feared these tribes were preparing to migrate south, closer to Italy, and that they had warlike intent. Caesar raised two new legions and defeated these tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Letters to Atticus'' [[s:Letters to Atticus/1.19|1.19]]; Julius Caesar, ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|Commentaries on the Gallic War]]'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 1|Book 1]]; Appian, ''Gallic Wars'' [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_gallic_1.html Epit. 3]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/38*.html#31 38.3150]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Caesar's earlier activities, the tribes in the north-east began to arm themselves. Caesar treated this as an aggressive move and, after an inconclusive engagement against the united tribes, he conquered the tribes piecemeal. Meanwhile, one of his legions began the conquest of the tribes in the far north, directly opposite [[Roman Britain|Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, ''Commentaries on the Gallic War'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 2|Book 2]]; Appian, ''Gallic Wars'' [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_gallic_1.html Epit. 4]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/39*.html#1 39.15]&lt;/ref&gt; During the spring of 56&amp;nbsp;BC, the Triumvirs held a conference, as Rome was in turmoil and Caesar's political alliance was coming undone. The [[Lucca Conference]] renewed the [[First Triumvirate]] and extended Caesar's governorship for another five years.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Letters to his brother Quintus'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Cic.+Q.+fr.+2.3 2.3]; Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#24 24]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#21 21], ''Crassus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#14 1415], ''Pompey'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#51 51]&lt;/ref&gt; The conquest of the north was soon completed, while a few pockets of resistance remained.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, ''Commentaries on the Gallic War'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 3|Book 3]]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/39*.html#40 39.4046]&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar now had a secure base from which to launch an invasion of Britain.

In 55 BC, Caesar repelled an incursion into Gaul by two Germanic tribes, and followed it up by building a bridge across the Rhine and making a show of force in Germanic territory, before returning and dismantling the bridge. Late that summer, having subdued two other tribes, he crossed into Britain, claiming that the Britons had aided one of his enemies the previous year, possibly the [[Veneti (Gaul)|Veneti]] of [[Brittany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of the British Isles |author=Black, Jeremy |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |year=2003 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; His intelligence information was poor, and although he gained a beachhead on the coast, he could not advance further, and returned to Gaul for the winter.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, ''Commentaries on the Gallic War'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 4|Book 4]]; Appian, ''Gallic Wars'' [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_gallic_1.html Epit. 4]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/39*.html#47 4753]&lt;/ref&gt; He returned the following year, better prepared and with a larger force, and achieved more. He advanced inland, and established a few alliances. However, poor harvests led to widespread revolt in Gaul, which forced Caesar to leave Britain for the last time.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Letters to friends'' [[s:Letters to friends/7.6|7.6]], [[s:Letters to friends/7.7|7.7]], [[s:Letters to friends/7.8|7.8]], [[s:Letters to friends/7.10|7.10]], [[s:Letters to friends/7.17|7.17]]; ''Letters to his brother Quintus'' [[s:Letters to his brother Quintus/2.13|2.13]], [[s:Letters to his brother Quintus/2.15|2.15]], [[s:Letters to his brother Quintus/3.1|3.1]]; ''Letters to Atticus'' [[s:Letters to Atticus/4.15|4.15]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/4.17|4.17]], [[s:Letters to Atticus/4.18|4.18]]; Julius Caesar, ''Commentaries on the Gallic War'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 5|Book 56]]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/40*.html#1 40.111]&lt;/ref&gt;

While Caesar was in Britain his daughter Julia, Pompey's wife, had died in childbirth. Caesar tried to re-secure Pompey's support by offering him his great-niece in marriage, but Pompey declined. In 53 BC Crassus was killed leading a failed [[Battle of Carrhae|invasion]] of the east. Rome was on the brink of civil war. Pompey was appointed sole consul as an emergency measure, and married the daughter of a political opponent of Caesar. The Triumvirate was dead.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#26]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#23.5 23.5], ''Pompey'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#53 5355], ''Crassus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#16 1633]; Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#46 4647]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Gallic tribes were just as strong as the Romans militarily, the internal division among the Gauls guaranteed an easy victory for Caesar. [[Vercingetorix]]'s attempt in 52 BC to unite them against Roman invasion came too late.&lt;ref name="EB_The_Roman_Conquest"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/215768/France/41196/The-press |title=France: The Roman conquest |website=[[Encyclopdia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopdia Britannica (company)|Encyclopdia Britannica]] |access-date=April 6, 2015 |quote="Because of chronic internal rivalries, Gallic resistance was easily broken, though Vercingetorixs Great Rebellion of 52 bce had notable successes."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The_first_triumvirate_and_the_conquest_of_Gaul"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/88114/Julius-Caesar/9735/The-first-triumvirate-and-the-conquest-of-Gaul |title=Julius Caesar: The first triumvirate and the conquest of Gaul |website=[[Encyclopdia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopdia Britannica (company)|Encyclopdia Britannica]] |access-date=February 15, 2015 |quote="Indeed, the Gallic cavalry was probably superior to the Roman, horseman for horseman.

[[File:Csar's Soldiers.gif|thumb|left|Caesar's soldiers (legionaries of this time did not wear [[lorica segmentata]], as pictured, but rather [[lorica hamata]])]]
In 50 BC, the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] (led by [[Pompey]]) ordered Caesar to disband his army and return to Rome because his term as governor had finished.&lt;ref name=Sue28&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#28 28]&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar thought he would be prosecuted if he entered Rome without the immunity enjoyed by a magistrate. Pompey accused Caesar of insubordination and treason. On January 10, 49 BC, Caesar crossed the [[Rubicon]] river (the frontier boundary of Italy) with only a single legion, the [[Legio XIII Gemina]], and ignited [[Caesar's Civil War|civil war]]. Upon [[crossing the Rubicon]], Caesar, according to [[Plutarch]] and Suetonius, is supposed to have quoted the Athenian playwright [[Menander]], in Greek, "[[alea iacta est|the die is cast]]".&lt;ref name=Plu65&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#32.8 32.8]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erasmus]], however, notes that the more accurate Latin translation of the Greek [[imperative mood]] would be "''alea iacta esto''", '''let''' the die be cast.&lt;ref name="FrijhoffSperna Weiland1988"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomson|first1=D.

Pompey, despite greatly outnumbering Caesar, who only had his Thirteenth Legion with him,  did not intend to fight. Caesar pursued Pompey, hoping to capture Pompey before his legions could escape.&lt;ref name=Plu35&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#35 35.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pompey managed to escape before Caesar could capture him.  Heading for [[Hispania|Spain]], Caesar left Italy under the control of [[Mark Antony]]. After an astonishing 27-day route-march, Caesar defeated Pompey's lieutenants, then returned east, to challenge Pompey in Illyria, where, in July 48 BC in the [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (48 BC)|battle of Dyrrhachium]], Caesar barely avoided a catastrophic defeat. In an exceedingly short engagement later that year, he decisively defeated Pompey [[Battle of Pharsalus|at Pharsalus]], in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#42 4245]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome, Caesar was appointed [[Roman dictator|dictator]],&lt;ref name=Plu37&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#37 37.2]&lt;/ref&gt; with Mark Antony as his [[Master of the Horse]] (second in command); Caesar presided over his own election to a second consulship and then, after 11 days, resigned this dictatorship.&lt;ref name=Plu37/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dictator"&gt;Martin Jehne, ''Der Staat des Dicators Caesar'', Kln/Wien 1987, p. 15-38.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar then pursued Pompey to Egypt, arriving soon after the murder of the general. There, Caesar was presented with Pompey's severed head and seal-ring, receiving these with tears.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Pompey'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#80 80.5]&lt;/ref&gt; He then had Pompey's assassins put to death.&lt;ref name=PluPom77&gt;Plutarch, ''Pompey'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#77 7779]&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar then became involved with an Egyptian civil war between the child pharaoh and his sister, wife, and co-regent queen, [[Cleopatra]]. Perhaps as a result of the pharaoh's role in Pompey's murder, Caesar sided with Cleopatra. He withstood the [[Siege of Alexandria (47 BC)|Siege of Alexandria]] and later he defeated the pharaoh's forces at the [[Battle of the Nile (47 BC)|Battle of the Nile]] in 47&amp;nbsp;BC and installed Cleopatra as ruler. Caesar and Cleopatra celebrated their victory with a triumphal procession on the [[Nile]] in the spring of 47&amp;nbsp;BC. The royal barge was accompanied by 400 additional ships, and Caesar was introduced to the luxurious lifestyle of the Egyptian pharaohs.&lt;ref name="Salisbury 2001 52"&gt;{{cite book|last=Salisbury|first=Joyce E|title=Women in the ancient world|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, CA|isbn=1-57607-092-1|page=52|chapter=Cleopatra VII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar and Cleopatra were not married. Caesar continued his relationship with Cleopatra throughout his last marriagein Roman eyes, this did not constitute adulteryand probably fathered a son called [[Caesarion]]. Cleopatra visited Rome on more than one occasion, residing in Caesar's villa just outside Rome across the [[Tiber]].&lt;ref name="Salisbury 2001 52"/&gt;

Late in 48 BC, Caesar was again appointed dictator, with a term of one year.&lt;ref name="Dictator"/&gt; After spending the first months of 47&amp;nbsp;BC in Egypt, Caesar went to the Middle East, where he annihilated the king of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]; his victory was so swift and complete that he mocked Pompey's previous victories over such poor enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#35 35.2]&lt;/ref&gt; On his way to Pontus, Caesar visited [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] from 27 to 29 May 47 BC (2527 May&lt;sup&gt;[[Gregorian calendar|greg.]]&lt;/sup&gt;), where he met enthusiastic support, but where, according to [[Cicero]], [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] was planning to kill him at this point.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar: a history of the art of war among the Romans down to the end of the Roman empire, with a detailed account of the campaigns of Caius Julius Caesar, page 791, Theodore Ayrault Dodge, Greenhill Books, 1995. {{ISBN|9781853672163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul: The Man and the Myth, page 15, Studies on personalities of the New Testament Personalities of the New Testament Series, Calvin J.

He quickly gained a significant victory in 46&amp;nbsp;BC over Cato, who then committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#52 5254]&lt;/ref&gt;

After this victory, he was appointed dictator for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Jehne, ''Der Staat des Dictators Caesar'', Kln/Wien 1987, p. 15-38. Technically, Caesar was not appointed dictator with a term of 10 years, but he was appointed annual dictator for the next 10 years in advance.&lt;/ref&gt; Pompey's sons escaped to Spain; Caesar gave chase and defeated the last remnants of opposition in the [[Battle of Munda]] in March 45&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#56 56]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Caesar was elected to his third and fourth terms as consul in 46&amp;nbsp;BC and 45&amp;nbsp;BC (this last time without a colleague).

==Dictatorship and assassination==

While he was still campaigning in Spain, the Senate began bestowing honours on Caesar. Caesar had not proscribed his enemies, instead pardoning almost all, and there was no serious public opposition to him. Great games and celebrations were held in April to honour Caesars victory at Munda. Plutarch writes that many Romans found the triumph held following Caesar's victory to be in poor taste, as those defeated in the civil war had not been foreigners, but instead fellow Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#56 56.756.8]&lt;/ref&gt; On Caesar's return to Italy in September 45 BC, he filed his will, naming his grandnephew [[Augustus|Gaius Octavius]] (Octavian, later known as Augustus Caesar) as his principal heir, leaving his vast estate and property including his name. Caesar also wrote that if Octavian died before Caesar did, [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus]] would be the next heir in succession.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, ''The Civil Wars'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/2*.html#143 2:143.1]&lt;/ref&gt; In his will, he also left a substantial gift to the citizens of Rome.

During his early career, Caesar had seen how chaotic and dysfunctional the Roman Republic had become. The republican machinery had broken down under the weight of [[imperialism]], the central government had become powerless, the provinces had been transformed into independent principalities under the absolute control of their governors, and the army had replaced the constitution as the means of accomplishing political goals. With a weak central government, political corruption had spiralled out of control, and the ''status quo'' had been maintained by a corrupt aristocracy, which saw no need to change a system that had made its members rich.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Between his crossing of the Rubicon in 49 BC, and his [[Ides of March|assassination]] in 44&amp;nbsp;BC, Caesar established a new constitution, which was intended to accomplish three separate goals.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 133"&gt;Abbott, 133&lt;/ref&gt; First, he wanted to suppress all armed resistance out in the provinces, and thus bring order back to the Republic. Second, he wanted to create a strong central government in Rome. Finally, he wanted to knit together all of the provinces into a single cohesive unit.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 133" /&gt;

The first goal was accomplished when Caesar defeated Pompey and his supporters.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 133" /&gt; To accomplish the other two goals, he needed to ensure that his control over the government was undisputed,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 134"&gt;Abbott, 134&lt;/ref&gt; so he assumed these powers by increasing his own authority, and by decreasing the authority of Rome's other political institutions. Finally, he enacted a series of reforms that were meant to address several long-neglected issues, the most important of which was his reform of the calendar.&lt;ref name=Sue40 /&gt;

===Dictatorship===
[[File:Caesar-Altes-Museum-Berlin.jpg|thumb|Bronze bust of Julius Caesar, [[Roman portraiture|posthumous portrait]] of the 1st century AD, [[Altes Museum]], Berlin]]
When Caesar returned to Rome, the Senate granted him [[Roman triumph|triumphs]] for his victories, ostensibly those over Gaul, Egypt, [[Pharnaces II of Pontus|Pharnaces]], and [[Juba I of Numidia|Juba]], rather than over his Roman opponents. Not everything went Caesar's way. When [[Arsinoe IV]], Egypt's former queen, was paraded in chains, the spectators admired her dignified bearing and were moved to pity.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' 43.19.23; [[Appian]], ''Civil Wars'' 2.101.420&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludi|Triumphal games]] were held, with [[Venationes|beast-hunts]] involving 400 lions, and [[Gladiator|gladiator contests]]. A [[Naumachia|naval battle]] was held on a flooded basin at the [[Campus Martius|Field of Mars]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;J.F.C. Fuller, ''Julius Caesar, Man, Soldier, Tyrant", Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Circus Maximus]], two armies of war captives, each of 2,000 people, 200 horses, and 20 elephants, fought to the death. Again, some bystanders complained, this time at Caesar's wasteful extravagance. A riot broke out, and only stopped when Caesar had two rioters sacrificed by the priests on the Field of Mars.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

After the triumph, Caesar set out to pass an ambitious legislative agenda.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He ordered a census be taken, which forced a reduction in the grain dole, and decreed that jurors could only come from the Senate or the equestrian ranks. He passed a sumptuary law that restricted the purchase of certain luxuries. After this, he passed a law that rewarded families for having many children, to speed up the repopulation of Italy. Then, he outlawed professional guilds, except those of ancient foundation, since many of these were subversive political clubs. He then passed a term-limit law applicable to governors. He passed a debt-restructuring law, which ultimately eliminated about a fourth of all debts owed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The [[Forum of Caesar]], with its [[Temple of Venus Genetrix]], was then built, among many other public works.&lt;ref name="Julius Caesar, Venus Genetrix, and the Forum Iulium "&gt;{{cite AV media | url=https://class.coursera.org/romanarchitecture-001/lecture/97 | title=Julius Caesar, Venus Genetrix, and the Forum Iulium | publisher=Yale University | people=Diana E. E. Kleiner | medium=Multimedia presentation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar also tightly regulated the purchase of state-subsidised grain and reduced the number of recipients to a fixed number, all of whom were entered into a special register.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History | author=Mackay, Christopher S. | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year = 2004 | page = 254}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 47 to 44&amp;nbsp;BC, he made plans for the distribution of land to about 15,000 of his veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Roman Army, 31 BCAD 337 | author=Campbell, J. B. | publisher=Routledge | year = 1994 | page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important change, however, was his reform of the calendar. The calendar was then regulated by the movement of the moon, and this had left it in a mess. Caesar replaced this calendar with the Egyptian calendar, which was regulated by the sun. He set the length of the year to 365.25 days by adding an [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary/leap day]] at the end of February every fourth year.&lt;ref name=Sue40&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#40 40]&lt;/ref&gt;

To bring the calendar into alignment with the seasons, he decreed that three extra months be inserted into 46&amp;nbsp;BC (the ordinary intercalary month at the end of February, and two extra months after November). Thus, the [[Julian calendar]] opened on 1 January 45 BC.&lt;ref name="Sue40"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This calendar is almost identical to [[Gregorian calendar|the current Western calendar]].

Shortly before his assassination, he passed a few more reforms.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He established a police force, appointed officials to carry out his land reforms, and ordered the rebuilding of [[Carthage]] and [[Roman Corinth|Corinth]]. He also extended Latin rights throughout the Roman world, and then abolished the tax system and reverted to the earlier version that allowed cities to collect tribute however they wanted, rather than needing Roman intermediaries. His assassination prevented further and larger schemes, which included the construction of an unprecedented temple to Mars, a huge theatre, and a library on the scale of the [[Library of Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

He also wanted to convert [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] to a major port, and cut a canal through the [[Isthmus of Corinth]]. Militarily, he wanted to conquer the [[Dacia]]ns and [[Parthia]]ns, and avenge the loss at [[Battle of Carrhae|Carrhae]]. Thus, he instituted a massive mobilisation. Shortly before his assassination, the Senate named him censor for life and [[Pater Patriae|Father of the Fatherland]], and the month of [[Quintilis]] was renamed July in his honour.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

He was granted further honours, which were later used to justify his assassination as a would-be divine monarch: coins were issued bearing his image and his statue was placed next to those of the kings. He was granted a golden chair in the Senate, was allowed to wear triumphal dress whenever he chose, and was offered a form of semi-official or popular [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|cult]], with Mark Antony as his [[Flamen Divi Iulii|high priest]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Political reforms====
{{Main|Constitutional reforms of Julius Caesar}}
[[File:La clmence de Csar.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|''La clmence de Csar'', [[Abel de Pujol]], 1808]]
The history of Caesar's political appointments is complex and uncertain. Caesar held both the [[Roman Dictator|dictatorship]] and the [[Tribune|tribunate]], but alternated between the [[Roman Consul|consulship]] and the [[proconsul]]ship.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 134" /&gt; His powers within the state seem to have rested upon these magistracies.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 134" /&gt; He was first appointed dictator in 49&amp;nbsp;BC, possibly to preside over elections, but resigned his dictatorship within 11 days. In 48&amp;nbsp;BC, he was reappointed dictator, only this time for an indefinite period, and in 46&amp;nbsp;BC, he was appointed dictator for 10 years.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 136"&gt;Abbott, 136&lt;/ref&gt;

In 48 BC, Caesar was given permanent tribunician powers,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 135"&gt;Abbott, 135&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2017}} which made his person sacrosanct and allowed him to veto the Senate,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 135"/&gt; although on at least one occasion, tribunes did attempt to obstruct him. The offending tribunes in this case were brought before the Senate and divested of their office.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 135" /&gt; This was not the first time Caesar had violated a tribune's sacrosanctity. After he had first marched on Rome in 49 BC, he forcibly opened the treasury, although a tribune had the seal placed on it. After the impeachment of the two obstructive tribunes, Caesar, perhaps unsurprisingly, faced no further opposition from other members of the Tribunician College.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 135"/&gt;

When Caesar returned to Rome in 47 BC, the ranks of the Senate had been severely depleted, so he used his censorial powers to appoint many new senators, which eventually raised the Senate's membership to 900.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 137"/&gt; All the appointments were of his own partisans, which robbed the senatorial aristocracy of its prestige, and made the Senate increasingly subservient to him.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 138"&gt;Abbott, 138&lt;/ref&gt; To minimise the risk that another general might attempt to challenge him,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 136"/&gt; Caesar passed a law that subjected governors to term limits.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 136"/&gt;

In 46 BC, Caesar gave himself the title of "Prefect of the Morals", which was an office that was new only in name, as its powers were identical to those of the ''[[Roman censor|censors]]''.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 135"/&gt; Thus, he could hold censorial powers, while technically not subjecting himself to the same checks to which the ordinary censors were subject, and he used these powers to fill the Senate with his own partisans. He also set the precedent, which his imperial successors followed, of requiring the Senate to bestow various titles and honours upon him. He was, for example, given the title of "Father of the Fatherland" and "''[[imperator]]''".&lt;ref name="Abbott, 136"/&gt;

Coins bore his likeness, and he was given the right to speak first during Senate meetings.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 136"/&gt; Caesar then increased the number of magistrates who were elected each year, which created a large pool of experienced magistrates, and allowed Caesar to reward his supporters.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 137"/&gt;

Caesar even took steps to transform Italy into a province, and to link more tightly the other provinces of the empire into a single cohesive unit. This addressed the underlying problem that had caused the [[Social War (9188 BC)|Social War]] decades earlier, where individuals outside Rome and Italy were not considered "Roman", thus were not given full citizenship rights. This process, of fusing the entire Roman Empire into a single unit, rather than maintaining it as a network of unequal principalities, would ultimately be completed by Caesar's successor, the emperor Augustus.

In February 44 BC, one month before his assassination, he was appointed dictator for life. Under Caesar, a significant amount of authority was vested in his lieutenants,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 136" /&gt; mostly because Caesar was frequently out of Italy.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 136" /&gt; In October 45&amp;nbsp;BC, Caesar resigned his position as sole consul, and facilitated the election of two successors for the remainder of the year, which theoretically restored the ordinary consulship, since the constitution did not recognise a single consul without a colleague.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 137"&gt;Abbott, 137&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RSC 0004a.6.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Denarius]] (42 BC) issued by Cassius Longinus and [[Publius Cornelius Lentulus Spinther|Lentulus Spinther]], depicting the crowned head of [[Libertas|Liberty]] and on the reverse a sacrificial jug and ''[[lituus]]'', from the military mint in [[Smyrna]]]]

Near the end of his life, Caesar began to prepare for a war against the [[Parthian Empire]]. Since his absence from Rome might limit his ability to install his own consuls, he passed a law which allowed him to appoint all magistrates in 43 BC, and all consuls and tribunes in 42 BC.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 137" /&gt; This, in effect, transformed the magistrates from being representatives of the people to being representatives of the dictator.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 137"/&gt;

===Assassination===
{{See also|Assassination of Julius Caesar}}
On the [[Ides of March]] (15 March; see [[Roman calendar]]) of 44 BC, Caesar was due to appear at a session of the Senate. Several Senators had conspired to assassinate Caesar. Mark Antony, having vaguely learned of the plot the night before from a terrified ''liberator'' named [[Servilius Casca]], and fearing the worst, went to head Caesar off. The plotters, however, had anticipated this and, fearing that Antony would come to Caesar's aid, had arranged for [[Trebonius]] to intercept him just as he approached the portico of the [[Theatre of Pompey]], where the session was to be held, and detain him outside (Plutarch, however, assigns this action to delay Antony to [[Brutus Albinus]]). When he heard the commotion from the Senate chamber, Antony fled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Huzar|first=Eleanor Goltz|title=Mark Antony, a biography By Eleanor Goltz Huzar|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis, MN|year=1978|pages=7980|isbn=978-0-8166-0863-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Plutarch]], as Caesar arrived at the Senate, [[Tillius Cimber]] presented him with a petition to recall his exiled brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/m_brutus.html |title=Plutarch  Life of Brutus |publisher=Classics.mit.edu |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other conspirators crowded round to offer support. Both Plutarch and Suetonius say that Caesar waved him away, but Cimber grabbed his shoulders and pulled down Caesar's [[tunic]]. Caesar then cried to Cimber, "Why, this is violence!" ("''Ista quidem vis est!''").&lt;ref name = "suetonius"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/suetonius-julius.html |title=Suetonius, 'Life of the Caesars, Julius', trans.

[[File:Karl Theodor von Piloty Murder of Caesar 1865.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|The [[Roman Senate|senators]] encircle Caesar, a 19th-century interpretation of the event by [[Carl Theodor von Piloty]]]]
At the same time, Casca produced his dagger and made a glancing thrust at the dictator's neck. Caesar turned around quickly and caught Casca by the arm. According to Plutarch, he said in Latin, "Casca, you villain, what are you doing?"&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Caesar'', ch. 66: "{{lang|grc|  ,  ' ,  ;}}'"&lt;/ref&gt; Casca, frightened, shouted, "Help, brother!" in [[Greek language|Greek]] ("{{lang|grc|, }}", "''adelphe, boethei''"). Within moments, the entire group, including Brutus, was striking out at the dictator. Caesar attempted to get away, but, blinded by blood, he tripped and fell; the men continued stabbing him as he lay defenceless on the lower steps of the portico. According to [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], around 60 men participated in the assassination. He was stabbed 23 times.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf Greg (2006), ''Et Tu Brute?  The Murder of Caesar and Political Assassination'', 199 pages  {{ISBN|1-86197-741-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Suetonius, a physician later established that only one wound, the second one to his chest, had been lethal.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'', c. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;
The dictator's last words are not known with certainty, and are a contested subject among scholars and historians alike. Suetonius reports that others have said Caesar's last words were the Greek phrase "{{lang|grc| , ;}}"&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#82.2 82.2]&lt;/ref&gt; (transliterated as "''Kai su, teknon?''": "You too, child?" in English). However, for himself, Suetonius says Caesar said nothing.&lt;ref&gt;From the [[John Carew Rolfe|J. C. Rolfe]] translation of 1914: "...he was stabbed with three and twenty wounds, uttering not a word, but merely a groan at the first stroke, though some have written that when [[Marcus Brutus]] rushed at him, he said in Greek, 'You too, my child?".&lt;/ref&gt;

Plutarch also reports that Caesar said nothing, pulling his toga over his head when he saw Brutus among the conspirators.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#66.9 66.9]&lt;/ref&gt; The version best known in the English-speaking world is the [[Latin language|Latin]] phrase "''[[Et tu, Brute?]]''" ("And you, Brutus?", commonly rendered as "You too, Brutus?");&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stone|first=Jon R.|title=The Routledge Dictionary of Latin Quotations|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=2005|page=250|isbn=0-415-96909-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Morwood|first=James|title=The Pocket Oxford Latin Dictionary (Latin-English)|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|year=1994|chapter=|isbn=0-19-860283-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this derives from Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', where it actually forms the first half of a [[macaronic]] line: "''Et tu, Brute?'' Then fall, Caesar." It has no basis in historical fact and Shakespeare's use of Latin here is not from any assertion that Caesar would have been using the language, rather than the Greek reported by Suetonius, but because the phrase was already popular when the play was written, as it appears in [[Richard Edes]]'s Latin play ''Caesar Interfectus'' of 1582 and ''The True Tragedie of Richarde Duke of Yorke &amp; etc.'' of 1595, Shakespeare's source work for other plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Works of William Shakespeare |last=Dyce |first=Alexander |authorlink= Alexander Dyce|quote=Quoting [[Edmond Malone|Malone]] |year= 1866|publisher=Chapman and Hall |location= London|isbn= |page= 648|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jean-Lon Grme - The Death of Caesar - Walters 37884.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|''[[The Death of Caesar]]'', [[Jean-Lon Grme]], 1867]]

According to Plutarch, after the assassination, Brutus stepped forward as if to say something to his fellow senators; they, however, fled the building.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#67 67]&lt;/ref&gt; Brutus and his companions then marched to the Capitol while crying out to their beloved city: "People of Rome, we are once again free!" They were met with silence, as the citizens of Rome had locked themselves inside their houses as soon as the rumour of what had taken place had begun to spread. Caesar's dead body lay where it fell on the Senate floor for nearly three hours before other officials arrived to remove it.

{{anchor|funeral}}
Caesar's body was cremated, and on the site of his cremation, the [[Temple of Caesar]] was erected a few years later (at the east side of the main square of the [[Roman Forum]]).

A crowd who had gathered there started a fire, which badly damaged the forum and neighbouring buildings. In the ensuing chaos, Mark Antony, Octavian (later Augustus Caesar), and others fought a series of five civil wars, which would end in the formation of the Roman Empire.

===Aftermath of the assassination===
The result unforeseen by the assassins was that Caesar's death precipitated the end of the Roman Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Florus, ''Epitome'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Florus/Epitome/2I*.html#XVII 2.7.1]&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman [[plebs|middle and lower classes]], with whom Caesar was immensely popular and had been since before Gaul, became enraged that a small group of aristocrats had killed their champion. Antony, who had been drifting apart from Caesar, capitalised on the grief of the Roman mob and threatened to unleash them on the ''[[Optimates]]'', perhaps with the intent of taking control of Rome himself. To his surprise and chagrin, Caesar had named his grandnephew [[Augustus|Gaius Octavius]] his sole heir (hence the name Octavian), bequeathing him the immensely potent Caesar name and making him one of the wealthiest citizens in the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#83.2 83.2]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:M Antonius.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mark Antony]]]]
The crowd at the funeral boiled over, throwing dry branches, furniture, and even clothing on to Caesar's funeral pyre, causing the flames to spin out of control, seriously damaging the Forum. The mob then attacked the houses of Brutus and Cassius, where they were repelled only with considerable difficulty, ultimately providing the spark for the [[Liberators' civil war|civil war]], fulfilling at least in part Antony's threat against the aristocrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_text_suetcaesar.htm |title=Suetonius, Life of Caesar, Chapters LXXXIII, LXXXIV, LXXXV |publisher=Ancienthistory.about.com |date=29 October 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antony did not foresee the ultimate outcome of the next series of civil wars, particularly with regard to Caesar's adopted heir. Octavian, aged only 18 when Caesar died, proved to have considerable political skills, and while Antony dealt with [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus|Decimus Brutus]] in the first round of the new civil wars, Octavian consolidated his tenuous position.

To combat Brutus and Cassius, who were massing an enormous army in Greece, Antony needed soldiers, the cash from Caesar's war chests, and the legitimacy that Caesar's name would provide for any action he took against them. With the passage of the ''lex Titia'' on 27 November 43 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Caesar's Legacy: Civil War and the Emergence of the Roman Empire | author=Osgood, Josiah | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year = 2006 | page = 60}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Second Triumvirate]] was officially formed, composed of Antony, Octavian, and Caesar's loyal cavalry commander [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#13.1 13.1]; Florus, ''Epitome'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Florus/Epitome/2I*.html#XVI 2.6]&lt;/ref&gt; It formally [[Apotheosis|deified]] Caesar as Divus Iulius in 42 BC, and Caesar Octavian henceforth became ''Divi filius'' ("Son of a god").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Roman Religion | author=Warrior, Valerie M. | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year = 2006 | page = 110 | isbn = 0-521-82511-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Caesar's clemency had resulted in his murder, the Second Triumvirate reinstated the practice of [[proscription]], abandoned since Sulla.&lt;ref&gt;Florus, ''Epitome'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Florus/Epitome/2I*.html#XVI 2.6.3]&lt;/ref&gt; It engaged in the legally sanctioned murder of a large number of its opponents to secure funding for its 45 legions in the second civil war against Brutus and Cassius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Ancient Rome: An Introductory History | author=Zoch, Paul A. | publisher=University of Oklahoma Press | year = 200 | pages = 217218| isbn = 0-8061-3287-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antony and Octavian defeated them at [[Battle of Philippi|Philippi]].&lt;ref&gt;Florus, ''Epitome'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Florus/Epitome/2I*.html#XXXIIII 2.7.1114]; Appian, ''The Civil Wars'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/5*.html 5.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Augustus Statue.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus]], Caesar's adopted heir]]
Afterward, Mark Antony formed an alliance with Caesar's lover, Cleopatra, intending to use the fabulously wealthy Egypt as a base to dominate Rome. A third civil war broke out between Octavian on one hand and Antony and Cleopatra on the other. This final civil war, culminating in the latter's defeat at [[Battle of Actium|Actium]] in 31 BC and [[Death of Cleopatra|suicide in Egypt]] in 30 BC, resulted in the permanent ascendancy of Octavian, who became the first Roman emperor, under the name Caesar Augustus, a name that raised him to the status of a deity.&lt;ref&gt;Florus, ''Epitome'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Florus/Epitome/2I*.html#XXXIIII 2.34.66]&lt;/ref&gt;

Julius Caesar had been preparing to invade [[Parthia]], the [[Caucasus]], and [[Scythia]], and then march back to [[Germania]] through Eastern Europe. These plans were thwarted by his assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#58 58.6]&lt;/ref&gt; His successors did attempt the conquests of Parthia and Germania, but without lasting results.

===Deification===
{{see also|Divus Julius|Caesar's Comet}}
Julius Caesar was the first historical Roman to be officially deified. He was posthumously granted the title ''Divus Iulius'' or ''Divus Julius'' (the divine Julius or the deified Julius) by decree of the Roman Senate on 1 January 42 BC. The [[Caesar's Comet|appearance of a comet]] during [[Ludi|games in his honour]] was taken as confirmation of his divinity. Though his temple was not dedicated until after his death, he may have received divine honours during his lifetime:&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Phillipic'' ii.110: Cicero refers to the divine honours of : "...couch, image, pediment, priest" given to Caesar in the months before his assassination.&lt;/ref&gt; and shortly before his assassination, Mark Antony had been appointed as his ''[[flamen]]'' (priest).&lt;ref&gt;According to Dio Cassius, 44.6.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Octavian and Mark Antony promoted the cult of'' Divus Iulius''. After the death of Antony, Octavian, as the adoptive son of Caesar, assumed the title of ''Divi Filius'' (son of a god).

Based on remarks by Plutarch,&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Caesar'' 17, 45, 60; see also Suetonius, ''Julius'' 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar is sometimes thought to have suffered from [[epilepsy]]. Modern scholarship is sharply divided on the subject, and some scholars believe that he was plagued by malaria, particularly during the Sullan proscriptions of the 80s.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald T. Ridley, "The Dictator's Mistake: Caesar's Escape from Sulla," ''Historia'' 49 (2000), pp. 225226, citing doubters of epilepsy: F. Kanngiesser, "Notes on the Pathology of the Julian Dynasty," ''Glasgow Medical Journal'' 77 (1912) 428432; T. Cawthorne, "Julius Caesar and the Falling Sickness, ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine'' 51 (1957) 2730, who prefers [[Mnire's disease]]; and O. Temkin, ''The Falling Sickness: A History of Epilepsy from the Greeks to the Beginnings of Modern Neurology'' (Baltimore 1971), p 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Several specialists in headache medicine believe that instead of epilepsy, a more accurate diagnosis would be migraine headache.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Diamond and Mary Franklin, ''Conquering Your Migraine: The Essential Guide to Understanding and Treating Migraines for all Sufferers and Their Families'', (New York: Fireside, 2001), 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars contend his epileptic seizures were due to a [[neurocysticercosis|parasitic infection in the brain]] by a tapeworm.&lt;ref name="bruschi"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruschi|first=Fabrizio|title=Was Julius Caesar's epilepsy due to neurocysticercosis?|journal=Trends in Parasitology|volume=27|issue=9|pages=373374|publisher=Cell Press|year=2011|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51493212_Was_Julius_Caesar's_epilepsy_due_to_neurocysticercosis?ev=prf_pub|accessdate=2 May 2013|doi=10.1016/j.pt.2011.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mclachlan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLachlan|first=Richard S.|title=Julius Caesar's Late Onset Epilepsy: A Case of Historic Proportions|journal=Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences|volume=37|issue=5|pages=557561|publisher=Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences Inc.|year=2010|url=http://apps.webofknowledge.com/full_record.do?product=WOS&amp;search_mode=GeneralSearch&amp;qid=4&amp;SID=P2Ajl5d3oe6ha3MO8EF&amp;page=1&amp;doc=2|accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar had four documented episodes of what may have been complex partial seizures. He may additionally have had [[absence seizure]]s in his youth. The earliest accounts of these seizures were made by the biographer Suetonius, who was born after Caesar died. The claim of epilepsy is countered among some medical historians by a claim of [[hypoglycemia]], which can cause epileptoid seizures.&lt;ref name="Hughes2004Caesar"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Hughes J|title=Dictator Perpetuus: Julius Caesardid he have seizures?

In 2003, psychiatrist Harbour F. Hodder published what he termed as the "Caesar Complex" theory, arguing that Caesar was a sufferer of [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] and the debilitating symptoms of the condition were a factor in Caesar's conscious decision to forgo personal safety in the days leading up to his assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hodder|first=Harbour Fraser|date=September 2003|title=Epilepsy and Empire, Caveat Caesar|journal=Accredited Psychiatry &amp; Medicine|publisher=Harvard University|location=Harvard, Boston|volume=106|issue=1|page=19|url=http://www.forensic-psych.com/articles/artHarvardMagCaesar.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A line from Shakespeare has sometimes been taken to mean that he was deaf in one ear: ''Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf''.&lt;ref&gt;William Shakespeare, ''Julius Caesar'' I.ii.209.&lt;/ref&gt; No classical source mentions hearing impairment in connection with Caesar. The playwright may have been making metaphorical use of a passage in Plutarch that does not refer to deafness at all, but rather to a gesture Alexander of Macedon customarily made. By covering his ear, Alexander indicated that he had turned his attention from an accusation in order to hear the defence.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Alexander'' 42; Jeremy Paterson discussing Caesar's health in general in "Caesar the Man," ''A Companion to Julius Caesar'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2009), p. 130 [https://books.google.com/books?id=gzOXLGbIIYwC&amp;pg=PT150&amp;dq=julius+caesar+deaf&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zPtSTO-xFYaDngfwjbHvAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=julius%20caesar%20deaf&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Francesco M. Galassi and Hutan Ashrafian suggest that Caesar's behavioral manifestationsheadaches, vertigo, falls (possibly caused by muscle weakness due to nerve damage), sensory deficit, giddiness and insensibilityand syncopal episodes were the results of cerebrovascular episodes, not epilepsy. Pliny the Elder reports in his Natural History that Caesar's father and forefather died without apparent cause while putting on their shoes. These events can be more readily associated with cardiovascular complications from a stroke episode or lethal heart attack. Caesar possibly had a genetic predisposition for cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galassi|first1=Francesco M.|last2=Ashrafian|first2=Hutan|title=Has the diagnosis of a stroke been overlooked in the symptoms of Julius Caesar?|journal=Neurological Sciences|date=29 March 2015|volume=36|issue=8|pages=15211522|doi=10.1007/s10072-015-2191-4|ref=Caesar Stroke}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suetonius]], writing more than a century after Caesar's death, describes Caesar as "tall of stature with a fair complexion, shapely limbs, a somewhat full face, and keen black eyes".&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Life of Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#45 45]: ''excelsa statura, colore candido, teretibus membris, ore paulo pleniore, nigris vegetisque oculis.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name and family===
====The name Gaius Julius Caesar====
{{Main|Gaius Julius Caesar (name)}}
Using the [[Latin alphabet]] of the period, which lacked the letters ''J'' and ''U'', Caesar's name would be rendered ''GAIVS IVLIVS CAESAR''; the form ''CAIVS'' is also attested, using the older Roman representation of ''G'' by ''C''. The standard abbreviation was ''C.&amp;nbsp;IVLIVS CSAR'', reflecting the older spelling. (The letterform '''' is a [[ligature (typography)|ligature]] of the letters ''A'' and ''E'', and is often used in Latin [[inscription]]s to save space.)

In Classical Latin, it was [[Latin spelling and pronunciation|pronounced]] {{IPA-la|a.i.s jul.i.s kaesar|}}. In the days of the late Roman Republic, many historical writings were done in Greek, a language most educated Romans studied. Young wealthy Roman boys were often taught by Greek slaves and sometimes sent to [[Athens]] for advanced training, as was Caesar's principal assassin, [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]]. In [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], during Caesar's time, his family name was written  (''Kasar''), reflecting its contemporary pronunciation. Thus, his name is pronounced in a similar way to the pronunciation of the German ''[[Kaiser]]''.

In [[Vulgar Latin]], the original [[diphthong]] {{IPA|[ae]}} first began to be pronounced as a simple long vowel {{IPA|[]}}. Then, the [[Stop consonant|plosive]] {{IPA|/k/}} before [[front vowel]]s began, due to [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]], to be pronounced as an [[affricate]], hence renderings like {{IPA|[tesar]}} in [[Italian language|Italian]] and {{IPA|[tsezar]}} in [[German language|German]] [[Latin regional pronunciation|regional pronunciations of Latin]], as well as the title of [[Tsar]]. With the evolution of the [[Romance languages]], the affricate {{IPA|[ts]}} became a [[Fricative consonant|fricative]] {{IPA|[s]}} (thus, {{IPA|[sesar]}}) in many regional pronunciations, including the French one, from which the modern English pronunciation is derived. The original {{IPA|/k/}} is preserved in [[Norse mythology]], where he is manifested as the legendary king [[Kjrr]].&lt;ref name="carlaz"&gt;Anderson, Carl Edlund. (1999). {{cite web |url= http://www.carlaz.com/phd/cea_phd_chap2.pdf |title= ''Formation and Resolution of Ideological Contrast in the Early History of Scandinavia'' |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070307030753/http://www.carlaz.com/phd/cea_phd_chap2.pdf |archivedate= 7 March 2007 |df= dmy-all }}. PhD thesis, University of Cambridge, Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse &amp; Celtic, p. 44.&amp;nbsp;{{small|(308&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar's [[cognomen]] itself became a title; it was promulgated by the [[Bible]], which contains the famous verse "[[Render unto Caesar]] the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's". The title became ''[[Kaiser]]'' in [[German language|German]] and [[Tsar]] or Czar in the [[Slavic languages]]. The last Tsar in nominal power was [[Simeon&amp;nbsp;II of Bulgaria]], whose reign ended in 1946. This means that for two thousand years after Julius Caesar's assassination, there was at least one head of state bearing his name.

;Children
* [[Julia (daughter of Julius Caesar)|Julia]], by Cornelia, born in 83 or 82 BC
* [[Caesarion]], by [[Cleopatra VII]], born 47 BC, and killed at age 17 by Caesar's adopted son Octavianus.
* ''Posthumously adopted'': [[Augustus|Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus]], his great-nephew by blood (grandson of [[Julia Minor (sister of Caesar)|Julia, his sister]]), who later became Emperor Augustus.

Suspected Children
* [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Marcus Junius Brutus]] (born 85 BC): The historian [[Plutarch]] notes that Caesar believed Brutus to have been his illegitimate son, as his mother [[Servilia (mother of Marcus Junius Brutus)|Servilia]] had been Caesar's lover during their youth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Brutus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Brutus*.html#5 5]&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar would have been 15 years old when Brutus was born.
* [[Junia Tertia]] (born ''ca.'' 60s BC), the daughter of Caesar's lover [[Servilia (mother of Marcus Junius Brutus)|Servilia]] was believed by [[Cicero]] among other contemporaries, to be Caesar's natural daughter.
* [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus]] (born ''ca.'' 8581 BC): On several occasions Caesar expressed how he loved Decimus Brutus like a son. This Brutus was also named an heir of Caesar in case Octavius had died before the latter. [[Ronald Syme]] argued that if a Brutus was the natural son of Caesar, Decimus was more likely than [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Marcus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Syme]], "Bastards in the Roman Aristocracy," pp. 323327. Thomas Africa thought Syme had recanted this view; see "The Mask of an Assassin: A Psychohistorical Study of [[Marcus Junius Brutus|M. Junius Brutus]]," ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' 8 (1978), p. 615, note 28, referring to Syme's book ''Sallust'' (Berkeley, 1964), p. 134. This would appear to be a misreading, given Syme's fuller argument twenty years later in "No Son for Caesar?" ''Historia'' 29 (1980) 422437, pp. 426430 regarding the greater likelihood that Decimus would be the Brutus who was Caesar's son.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Grandchildren
* Grandson from [[Julia (daughter of Julius Caesar)|Julia]] and [[Pompey]], dead at several days, unnamed.

;Lovers
* [[Cleopatra|Cleopatra VII]], mother of [[Caesarion]]
* [[Servilia (mother of Marcus Junius Brutus)|Servilia]], mother of Brutus

;Notable relatives
* [[Gaius Marius]] (married to his paternal aunt [[Julia (wife of Marius)|Julia]])
* [[Mark Antony]] (his relative through Antony's mother [[Julia Antonia|Julia]])
* [[Lucius Julius Caesar (consul 64 BC)|Lucius Julius Caesar]] (his third-cousin)
* [[Julius Sabinus]], a [[Gaul]] of the [[Lingones]] at the time of the [[Batavian rebellion]] of AD 69, claimed to be the great-grandson of Caesar on the grounds that his great-grandmother had been Caesar's lover during the [[Gallic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 4#55|4.55]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rumors of homosexuality===
Roman society viewed the passive role during [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|sexual activity]], regardless of gender, to be a sign of submission or inferiority. Indeed, Suetonius says that in Caesar's Gallic triumph, his soldiers sang that, "Caesar may have conquered the Gauls, but Nicomedes conquered Caesar."&lt;ref name="Suet.1.49"&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#49 49]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cicero, [[Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus|Bibulus]], [[Gaius Memmius (poet)|Gaius Memmius]], and others (mainly Caesar's enemies), he had an affair with [[Nicomedes IV of Bithynia]] early in his career. The tales were repeated, referring to Caesar as the Queen of Bithynia, by some Roman politicians as a way to humiliate him. Caesar himself denied the accusations repeatedly throughout his lifetime, and according to [[Cassius Dio]], even under oath on one occasion.&lt;ref name="Suet.1.2"&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#49 49]; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/43*.html#20 43.20]&lt;/ref&gt; This form of slander was popular during this time in the Roman Republic to demean and discredit political opponents. A favorite tactic used by the opposition was to accuse a popular political rival as living a Hellenistic lifestyle based on Greek and Eastern culture, where homosexuality and a lavish lifestyle were more acceptable than in Roman tradition.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Catullus]] wrote two poems suggesting that Caesar and his engineer [[Mamurra]] were lovers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Catullus]], ''Carmina'' [http://www.vroma.org/~hwalker/VRomaCatullus/029x.html 29], [http://www.vroma.org/~hwalker/VRomaCatullus/057x.html 57]&lt;/ref&gt; but later apologised.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#73 73]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Antony]] charged that Octavian had earned his adoption by Caesar through sexual favors. Suetonius described Antony's accusation of an affair with Octavian as political [[slander]]. Octavian eventually became the first Roman Emperor as Augustus.&lt;ref name="Suet.2.68"&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#68 68], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#71 71]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary works==
[[File:Julii Caesaris quae exstant.tif|thumb|''Julii Caesaris quae exstant'' (1678)]]
During his lifetime, Caesar was regarded as one of the best orators and prose authors in Latineven Cicero spoke highly of Caesar's rhetoric and style.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Brutus'', 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Only Caesar's war commentaries have survived. A few sentences from other works are quoted by other authors. Among his lost works are [[Laudatio Iuliae amitae|his funeral oration]] for his paternal aunt [[Julia (aunt of Caesar and wife of Marius)|Julia]] and his ''[[Anticato]]'', a document written to defame [[Cato the Younger|Cato]] in response to Cicero's published praise. [[Poems by Julius Caesar]] are also mentioned in ancient sources.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Courtney, ''The Fragmentary Latin Poets'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993), pp. 153155 and 187188. See also [[Poems by Julius Caesar]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memoirs===
[[File:Commentarii de Bello Gallico.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A 1783 edition of ''The Gallic Wars'']]
* The ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'', usually known in English as ''The Gallic Wars,'' seven books each covering one year of his campaigns in Gaul and southern Britain in the 50s BC, with the eighth book written by [[Aulus Hirtius]] on the last two years.
* The ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili]]'' (''The Civil War''), events of the Civil War from Caesar's perspective, until immediately after Pompey's death in Egypt.

Other works historically have been attributed to Caesar, but their authorship is in doubt:
* ''[[De Bello Alexandrino]]'' (''On the Alexandrine War''), campaign in Alexandria;
* ''[[De Bello Africo]]'' (''On the African War''), campaigns in North Africa; and
* ''[[De Bello Hispaniensi]]'' (''On the Hispanic War''), campaigns in the [[Iberian Peninsula]].

These narratives were written and published annually during or just after the actual campaigns, as a sort of "dispatches from the front." They were important in shaping Caesar's public image and enhancing his reputation when he was away from Rome for long periods. They may have been presented as public readings.&lt;ref&gt;T.P. Wiseman, The Publication of ''De Bello Gallico'', ''Julius Caesar as Artful Reporter'' (Classical Press of Wales, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; As a model of clear and direct Latin style, ''The Gallic Wars'' traditionally has been studied by first- or second-year Latin students.

The texts written by Caesar, an autobiography of the most important events of his public life, are the most complete [[primary source]] for the reconstruction of his biography. However, Caesar wrote those texts with his political career in mind, so historians must struggle to filter the exaggerations and bias contained in it.&lt;ref&gt;Canfora, p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman emperor [[Augustus]] began a [[cult of personality]] of Caesar, which described Augustus as Caesar's political heir. The modern historiography is influenced by the Octavian traditions, such as when Caesar's epoch is considered a turning point in the history of the Roman Empire. Still, historians try to filter the Octavian bias.&lt;ref&gt;Canfora, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Many rulers in history became interested in the [[Roman historiography|historiography of Caesar]]. [[Napoleon III]] wrote the scholarly work ''[[Histoire de Jules Csar]]'', which was not finished. The second volume listed previous rulers interested in the topic. [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] ordered a monk to prepare a translation of the ''Gallic Wars'' in 1480. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] ordered a topographic study in France, to place in Gallic Wars in context; which created forty high-quality maps of the conflict. The contemporary Ottoman sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] catalogued the surviving editions of the ''Commentaries'', and translated them to Turkish language. [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] and [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] of France translated the first two commentaries and the last two respectively; [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] retranslated the first one afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Canfora, pp. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
{{Main|Caesarism}}
Julius Caesar is seen as the main example of ''[[Caesarism]]'', a form of political rule led by a [[charisma]]tic [[Strongman (politics)|strongman]] whose rule is based upon a [[cult of personality]], whose rationale is the need to rule by force, establishing a violent [[social order]], and being a regime involving prominence of the [[military]] in the government.&lt;ref name="Weber, 34" &gt;{{Cite book|title=Caesarism, Charisma, and Fate: Historical Sources and Modern Resonances in the Work of Max Weber|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=2008|ref={{harvid|Weber}}|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other people in history, such as the French [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and the Italian [[Benito Mussolini]], have defined themselves as Caesarists. Bonaparte did not focus only on Caesar's military career but also on his relation with the masses, a predecessor to [[populism]].&lt;ref&gt;Canfora, pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; The word is also used in a pejorative manner by critics of this type of political rule.

&lt;!--sorting using Roman naming conventions would give Julius, Gaius Caesar using gens name as most important naming element; (admittedly, this pattern would not actually have occurred during the period, since it is really a means of sorting a list for the modern era in English); however, since he is commonly known as Julius Caesar in English; this should be maintained--&gt;
