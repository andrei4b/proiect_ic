'''Mark Elliot Zuckerberg''' ({{IPAc-en||z||k|r|b|r|g}}; born May 14, 1984) is an American [[List of Internet entrepreneurs|technology entrepreneur]] and philanthropist best known for co-founding and leading [[Facebook]], as its chairman and [[chief executive officer]].&lt;ref name=FBM&gt;{{cite web |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/facebook-surges-mark-zuckerberg-pockets-3-8-billion-143114560.html|work=Yahoo!

Born in [[White Plains, New York]], Zuckerberg attended [[Harvard University]] where he launched Facebook from his dormitory room on February 4, 2004 with college roommates [[Eduardo Saverin]], [[Andrew McCollum]], [[Dustin Moskovitz]], and [[Chris Hughes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/how-facebook-was-founded-2010-3#we-can-talk-about-that-after-i-get-all-the-basic-functionality-up-tomorrow-night-1 |title=At Last&amp;nbsp; The Full Story Of How Facebook Was Founded|work=Business Insider|first=Nicholas|last=Carlson|date=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the group began expanding the company across college campuses, it expanded rapidly, reaching one billion users by 2012. Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. His [[net worth]] is estimated to be [[United States dollar|US$]]66.4 billion as of April 19, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/mark-zuckerberg/|title=Mark Zuckerberg|work=Forbes|access-date=March 5, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Ardsley High School]], Zuckerberg excelled in classes. He transferred to the private school [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], in New Hampshire, in his junior year, where he won prizes in science (mathematics, astronomy, and physics) and classical studies. In his youth, he also attended the [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] [[Center for Talented Youth]] summer camp. On his college application, Zuckerberg stated that he could read and write French, Hebrew, Latin, and ancient Greek. He was captain of the fencing team.&lt;ref name=Kirkpatrick&gt;{{cite book |title=The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company That Is Connecting the World |last=Kirkpatrick |first=David |year=2010 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4391-0211-4 |pages=2021 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RRUkLhyGZVgC&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|access-date=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whatwelearned"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Caitlin |last=McDevitt |title=What We Learned About Mark Zuckerberg This Week |date=March 5, 2010 |url=http://www.thebigmoney.com/blogs/facebook-status/2010/03/05/what-we-learned-about-mark-zuckerberg-week |work=The Big Money|access-date=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Grynbaum |first=Michael M. |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/6/10/mark-e-zuckerberg-06-the-whiz |title=Mark E.

==Software developer==
===Early years===
Zuckerberg began using computers and writing software in [[middle school]]. His father taught him [[Atari]] [[BASIC Programming]] in the 1990s, and later hired software developer David Newman to tutor him privately. Zuckerberg took a graduate course in the subject at [[Mercy College (New York)|Mercy College]] near his home while still in high school. In one program, since his father's dental practice was operated from their home, he built a software program he called "ZuckNet" that allowed all the computers between the house and dental office to communicate with each other. It is considered a "primitive" version of [[AOL]]'s [[Instant messaging|Instant Messenger]], which came out the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.letsintern.com/blog/4-thing-mark-zuckerberg/ |title=4-thing-mark-zuckerberg | access-date=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://learni.st/users/jacobrwheeler/boards/83006-facebook-founder-mark-zuckerberg-child-prodigy |title=facebook-founder-mark-zuckerberg-child-prodigy | access-date=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to writer [[Jose Antonio Vargas]], "some kids played computer games. Mark created them." Zuckerberg himself recalls this period: "I had a bunch of friends who were artists. They'd come over, draw stuff, and I'd build a game out of it." However, notes Vargas, Zuckerberg was not a typical "geek-klutz", as he later became captain of his prep school [[fencing]] team and earned a classics diploma. [[Napster]] co-founder [[Sean Parker]], a close friend, notes that Zuckerberg was "really into Greek odysseys and all that stuff", recalling how he once quoted lines from the Roman epic poem ''[[Aeneid]]'', by [[Virgil]], during a Facebook product conference.&lt;ref name="NEWYORKER2010" /&gt;

During Zuckerberg's high school years, he worked under the company name Intelligent Media Group to build a music player called the Synapse Media Player. The device used [[machine learning]] to learn the user's listening habits, which was posted to ''[[Slashdot]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slashdot.org/articles/03/04/21/110236.shtml |title=Machine Learning and MP3s |author=Hemos/Dan Moore |date=April 21, 2003 |work=Slashdot|access-date=September 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from ''[[PC Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1748374,00.asp |title=Synapse Media Player Review |first=Troy |last=Dreier |date=February 8, 2005 |work=PCMag.com |access-date=September 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===College years===
Vargas noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at [[Harvard]], he had already achieved a "reputation as a programming prodigy". He studied [[psychology]] and [[computer science]] and belonged to [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]] and [[Kirkland House]].&lt;ref name = POTY /&gt;&lt;ref name="NEWYORKER2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Mark Zuckerberg speaks at BYU, calls Facebook "as much psychology and sociology as it is technology" |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700121651/Mark-Zuckerberg-speaks-at-BYU-calls-Facebook-as-much-psychology-and-sociology-as-it-is-technology.html?pg=2 |first=Chase |last=Larson |publisher=Deseret News |date=March 25, 2011|access-date=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[sophomore]] year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and also to help them form study groups. A short time later, he created a different program he initially called [[History of Facebook#Facemash|Facemash]] that let students select the best looking person from a choice of photos. According to Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg's roommate at the time, "he built the site for fun". Hasit explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, he built a site and placed two pictures, or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was "hotter" and according to the votes there would be a ranking.&lt;ref name=Hasit&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/facebook-founder-s-roommate-recounts-creation-of-internet-giant-1.275748 |title=Facebook founder's roommate recounts creation of Internet giant |publisher=Haaretz |date=Oct 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The site went up over a weekend, but by Monday morning, the college shut it down, because its popularity had overwhelmed one of Harvard's [[network switch]]es and prevented students from accessing the Internet. In addition, many students complained that their photos were being used without permission. Zuckerberg apologized publicly, and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was "completely improper."&lt;ref name=Hasit /&gt;

The following semester, in January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new Web site.&lt;ref name="Hoffman, Claire"&gt;{{Cite news |access-date=February 5, 2009 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/21129674/the_battle_for_facebook/ |title=The Battle for Facebook |newspaper=Rolling Stone |location=New York |date=June 28, 2008 |author=Hoffman, Claire |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703220456/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/21129674/the_battle_for_facebook/ |archivedate=July 3, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched "Thefacebook", originally located at thefacebook.com.&lt;ref name="skepticism"&gt;{{Cite news|access-date=April 30, 2008 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118539991204578084 |title=Judge Expresses Skepticism About Facebook Lawsuit |work=The Wall Street Journal |location=New York |date=July 25, 2007 |author=Seward, Zachary M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors, [[Cameron Winklevoss]], [[Tyler Winklevoss]], and [[Divya Narendra]], accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called [[ConnectU|HarvardConnection.com]], while he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product.&lt;ref name="zuckerberghacked"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Nicolas |last=Carlson |title=In 2004, Mark Zuckerberg Broke Into A Facebook User's Private Email Account |date=March 5, 2010 |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-into-the-harvard-crimson-2010-3 |work=Business Insider |access-date =March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three complained to ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', and the newspaper began an investigation in response.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Following the official launch of the Facebook social media platform, the three filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg that resulted in a settlement.&lt;ref name=nytb&gt;{{Cite news |work=New York Times blog |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/judge-ends-facebooks-feud-with-connectu/index.html |date=June 28, 2008 |title=Judge Ends Facebook's Feud With ConnectU |author=Stone, Brad}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreed settlement was for 1.2 million Facebook shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/feb/02/facebook-ipo-winklevoss-300m-fortune |title=Facebook IPO sees Winklevoss twins heading for $300m fortune |date=February 2, 2012 |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Dominic |last=Rushe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard in his sophomore year in order to complete his project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/Latest-News-Wires/2011/1109/Mark-Zuckerberg-Harvard-dropout-returns-to-open-arms |title=Mark Zuckerberg, Harvard dropout, returns to open arms |publisher=CS Monitor |date=November 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014, he recalled:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I remember really vividly, you know, having pizza with my friends a day or two afterI opened up the first version of Facebook at the time I thought, "You know, someone needs to build a service like this for the world." But I just never thought that we'd be the ones to help do it. And I think a lot of what it comes down to is we just cared more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=As Mark Zuckerberg Turns 30, His 10 Best Quotes as CEO |url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/233890?newsletter=true |work=Entrepreneur |publisher=Entrepreneur Media, Inc|access-date=16 May 2014 |first=Jason |last=Fell |date=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On May 28, 2017, Zuckerberg received an [[honorary degree]] from Harvard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Steinbock |first1=Anna |title=Harvard awards 10 honorary degrees |url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/05/harvard-awards-10-honorary-degrees-at-366th-commencement/ |accessdate=May 25, 2017 |work=[[Harvard Gazette]] |date=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pppfocus.com/2017/05/28/13-years-after-quitting-facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-gets-honorary-harvard-degree/ |title=13 YEARS AFTER QUITTING, FACEBOOK CEO MARK ZUCKERBERG GETS HONORARY HARVARD DEGREE |publisher=PPP Focus |date=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched Facebook from his Harvard dormitory room.&lt;ref name="rww051009"&gt;{{cite web |title=Did Mark Zuckerberg's Inspiration for Facebook Come Before Harvard? |url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/mark_zuckerberg_inspiration_for_facebook_before_harvard.php |work=ReadWrite Social |publisher=SAY Media, Inc|access-date=March 26, 2013 |first=Steffan |last=Antonas |date=May 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201185222/http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/mark_zuckerberg_inspiration_for_facebook_before_harvard.php |archivedate=February 1, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Exeter&gt;{{cite web |title=Face-to-Face with Mark Zuckerberg '02 |url=http://www.exeter.edu/news_and_events/news_events_5594.aspx |work=Phillips Exeter Academy |publisher=Phillips Exeter Academy|access-date=March 26, 2013 |date=January 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier inspiration for Facebook may have come from [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], the prep school from which Zuckerberg graduated in 2002. It published its own student directory, "The Photo Address Book", which students referred to as "The Facebook". Such photo directories were an important part of the student social experience at many private schools. With them, students were able to list attributes such as their class years, their friends, and their telephone numbers.&lt;ref name="rww051009" /&gt;

Once at college, Zuckerberg's Facebook started off as just a "Harvard thing" until Zuckerberg decided to spread it to other schools, enlisting the help of roommate [[Dustin Moskovitz]]. They began with [[Columbia University]], [[New York University]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Brown University|Brown]], and [[Yale University|Yale]].&lt;ref&gt;

"Mark was clearly on to great things," said Laine, who was Facebook's fourteenth user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Zuckerberg's Roomie Aims to Win for Haiti |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443659204577572852311606434 |access-date=March 26, 2013 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=August 7, 2012 |author=Alice Speri}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zuckerberg, Moskovitz and some friends moved to [[Palo Alto, California]] in [[Silicon Valley]] where they leased a small house that served as an office. Over the summer, Zuckerberg met [[Peter Thiel]], who invested in the company. They got their first office in mid-2004. According to Zuckerberg, the group planned to return to Harvard, but eventually decided to remain in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zuckerberg To Leave Harvard Indefinitely |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2005/11/1/zuckerberg-to-leave-harvard-indefinitely-mark/ |work=The Harvard Crimson |publisher=The Harvard Crimson, Inc|access-date=March 26, 2013 |first=Sam |last=Teller |date=November 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Business, Casual. |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2005/2/24/business-casual-a-year-ago-mark/ |work=The Harvard Crimson |publisher=The Harvard Crimson, Inc|access-date=March 26, 2013 |author=Kevin J. Feeney |date=February 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had already turned down offers by major corporations to buy the company. In an interview in 2007, Zuckerberg explained his reasoning: "It's not because of the amount of money. For me and my colleagues, the most important thing is that we create an open information flow for people. Having media corporations owned by [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]s is just not an attractive idea to me."&lt;ref name=Exeter /&gt;

He restated these goals to ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine in 2010: "The thing I really care about is the mission, making the world open."&lt;ref name="wired-zuckerberg" /&gt; Earlier, in April 2009, Zuckerberg sought the advice of former [[Netscape]] CFO [[Peter Currie (businessman)|Peter Currie]] about financing strategies for Facebook.&lt;ref name=twsOctBPP&gt;{{cite news |title=Yu, Zuckerberg and the Facebook fallout |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/mediafile/2009/04/01/yu-zuckerberg-and-the-facebook-fallout/|access-date=March 26, 2013 |newspaper=Reuters |date=April 1, 2009 |first=Robert |last=MacMillan |quote=In a back-to-the-future move, former Netscape CFO Peter Currie will be the key adviser to Facebook about financial matters, until a new search for a CFO is found, sources said.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 21, 2010, Zuckerberg reported that the company reached the 500 million-user mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=500 Million Stories |first=Mark |last=Zuckerberg |url=https://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=409753352130 |publisher=The Facebook Blog |date=July 22, 2010|access-date=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked whether Facebook could earn more income from advertising as a result of its phenomenal growth, he explained: &lt;blockquote&gt;I guess we could&amp;nbsp;... If you look at how much of our page is taken up with ads compared to the average [[Search engine marketing|search]] query. The average for us is a little less than 10 percent of the pages and the average for search is about 20 percent taken up with ads&amp;nbsp;... That's the simplest thing we could do. But we aren't like that. We make enough money. Right, I mean, we are keeping things running; we are growing at the rate we want to.&lt;ref name="wired-zuckerberg" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2010, [[Steven Levy]], who wrote the 1984 book ''[[Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution]]'', wrote that Zuckerberg "clearly thinks of himself as a [[Hacker culture|hacker]]". Zuckerberg said that "it's OK to break things" "to make them better".&lt;ref name="wired041910"&gt;{{cite news|access-date=September 23, 2010 |url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/04/ff_hackers/all/1 |title=Geek Power: Steven Levy Revisits Tech Titans, Hackers, Idealists |publisher=Wired |date=April 19, 2010 |author=Levy, Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fast092410"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=September 24, 2010 |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/mic/2010/profile/facebook |title=The World's Most Innovative Companies 2010 |publisher=Fast Company |date=February 17, 2010 |author=McGirt, Ellen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook instituted "[[hackathon]]s" held every six to eight weeks where participants would have one night to conceive of and complete a project.&lt;ref name="wired041910" /&gt; The company provided music, food, and beer at the hackathons, and many Facebook staff members, including Zuckerberg, regularly attended.&lt;ref name="fast092410" /&gt; "The idea is that you can build something really good in a night", Zuckerberg told Levy. "And that's part of the personality of Facebook now&amp;nbsp;... It's definitely very core to my personality."&lt;ref name="wired041910" /&gt;

''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine named Zuckerberg number 1 on its 2010 list of the Top 100 "most influential people of the [[Information Age]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=September 23, 2010 |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2010/10/the-vf-100-201010?currentPage=1 |title=The Vanity Fair 100 |publisher=Vanity Fair |date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckerberg ranked number 23 on the ''Vanity Fair'' 100 list in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=September 23, 2010 |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2009/10/new-establishment200910?currentPage=all |title=The Vanity Fair 100 |publisher=Vanity Fair |date=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Zuckerberg was chosen as number 16 in ''[[New Statesman]]''{{'}}s annual survey of the world's 50 most influential figures.&lt;ref name="htanna"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mark Zuckerberg&amp;nbsp; 50 People who matter 2010 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/digital/2010/09/zuckerberg-faceman-site-world |work=New Statesman |location=UK |access-date=September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 interview with [[PBS]] shortly after the death of [[Steve Jobs]], Zuckerberg said that Jobs had advised him on how to create a management team at Facebook that was "focused on building as high quality and good things as you are".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-07/facebook-s-zuckerberg-says-steve-jobs-advised-on-company-focus-management.html |title=Facebook's Zuckerberg says Steve Jobs advised on company focus, management |work=Bloomberg |date=November 7, 2011 |access-date=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2012, Zuckerberg visited [[Russia]]n Prime Minister [[Dmitry Medvedev]] in Moscow to stimulate social media innovation in Russia and to boost Facebook's position in the Russian market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zuckerberg in Moscow to boost Facebook's presence |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20121001-zuckerberg-moscow-boost-facebooks-presence-0 |publisher=France24.com |date=October 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003232618/http://www.france24.com/en/20121001-zuckerberg-moscow-boost-facebooks-presence-0 |archivedate=October 3, 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Russia's communications minister tweeted that Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev urged the social media giant's founder to abandon plans to lure away Russian programmers and instead consider opening a research center in Moscow.

At the 2013 [[TechCrunch#TechCrunch Disrupt|TechCrunch Disrupt]] conference, held in September, Zuckerberg stated that he is working towards registering the 5 billion humans who were not connected to the Internet as of the conference on Facebook. Zuckerberg then explained that this is intertwined with the aim of the Internet.org project, whereby Facebook, with the support of other technology companies, seeks to increase the number of people connected to the internet.&lt;ref name="Six"&gt;{{cite web |title=6 Things We Learned From Marissa Mayer and Mark Zuckerberg at TechCrunch Disrupt 2013 |url=http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2296067/6-Things-We-Learned-From-Marissa-Mayer-and-Mark-Zuckerberg-at-TechCrunch-Disrupt-2013 |work=TechCrunch |publisher=AOL Inc|access-date=September 23, 2013 |first=Victoria |last=Edwards |date=September 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sew"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mark Zuckerberg Creates Tech Justice League to Bring Internet to the Masses |url=http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2290350/Mark-Zuckerberg-Creates-Tech-Justice-League-to-Bring-Internet-to-the-Masses |work=Search Engine Watch |publisher=Incisive Media  Incisive Interactive Marketing LLC|access-date=September 23, 2013 |first=Alastair |last=Stevenson |date=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zuckerberg was the keynote speaker at the 2014 Mobile World Congress (MWC), held in [[Barcelona]], Spain, in March 2014, which was attended by 75,000 delegates.

Alongside other American technology figures like [[Jeff Bezos]] and [[Tim Cook]], Zuckerberg hosted visiting Chinese politician [[Lu Wei (politician)|Lu Wei]], known as the "Internet czar" for his influence in the enforcement of China's online policy, at Facebook's headquarters on December 8, 2014. The meeting occurred after Zuckerberg participated in a Q&amp;A session at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, on October 23, 2014, where he attempted to converse in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]]; although Facebook is banned in China, Zuckerberg is highly regarded among the people and was at the university to help fuel the nation's burgeoning entrepreneur sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Alex Hern, Jonathan Kaiman |title=Mark Zuckerberg addresses Chinese university in Mandarin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/23/mark-zuckerberg-chinese-university-fluent-mandarin-video|access-date=December 14, 2014 |work=The Guardian |date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Zuckerberg fielded questions during a live Q&amp;A session at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park on December 11, 2014. The founder and CEO explained that he does not believe Facebook is a waste of time, because it facilitates social engagement, and participating in a public session was so that he could "learn how to better serve the community".&lt;ref name="Tad"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Maria Tadeo |title=Mark Zuckerberg Q&amp;A: What we learnt about the Facebook founder |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/mark-zuckerberg-qa-what-we-learnt-about-the-facebook-founder-9921582.html|access-date=December 14, 2014 |work=The Independent |date=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sam"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Sam Colt |title=Facebook May Be Adding a 'Dislike' Button |url=http://www.inc.com/business-insider/Facebook-may-be-adding-a-dislike-button.html?cid=em01011week50day12d |website=Inc. |publisher=Monsueto Ventures|access-date=December 14, 2014 |date=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wirehog===
{{Main|Wirehog}}
A month after Zuckerberg launched Facebook in February 2004, [[i2hub]], another campus-only service, created by [[Wayne Chang]], was launched. i2hub focused on [[peer-to-peer]] file sharing. At the time, both i2hub and Facebook were gaining the attention of the press and growing rapidly in users and publicity. In August 2004, Zuckerberg, [[Andrew McCollum]], [[Adam D'Angelo]], and [[Sean Parker]] launched a competing peer-to-peer file sharing service called [[Wirehog]], a precursor to [[Facebook Platform]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |publisher=Martey Dodoo |url=http://www.marteydodoo.com/2004/08/16/wirehog/ |date=August 16, 2004 |title=Wirehog? |author=Martey Dodoo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=Harvard Crimson |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/8/13/zuckerberg-programs-new-website-having-seemingly/ |date=August 13, 2004 |title=Zuckerberg Programs New Website |author=Alan J.

On May 24, 2007, Zuckerberg announced [[Facebook Platform]], a development platform for programmers to create social applications within Facebook. Within weeks, many applications had been built and some already had millions of users. It grew to more than 800,000 developers around the world building applications for Facebook Platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gits4u.com/infotech/info15.htm |title=80000 developers |access-date=April 21, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324022748/http://www.gits4u.com/infotech/info15.htm |archivedate=March 24, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 2007, Zuckerberg announced Beacon, a social advertising system that enabled people to share information with their Facebook friends based on their browsing activities on other sites. For example, [[eBay]] sellers could let friends know automatically what they have for sale via the Facebook news feed as they listed items for sale. The program came under scrutiny because of privacy concerns from groups and individual users. Zuckerberg and Facebook failed to respond to the concerns quickly, and on December 5, 2007, Zuckerberg wrote a blog post on Facebook,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=7584397130 |title=The Facebook Blog &amp;#124; Facebook |publisher=Blog.facebook.com |access-date=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking responsibility for the concerns about Beacon and offering an easier way for users to opt out of the service.

In 2007, Zuckerberg was added to [[MIT Technology Review]]'s [[TR35]] list as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/TR35/Profile.aspx?TRID=635 |title=2007 Young Innovators Under 35: Mark Zuckerberg, 23 |publisher=[[MIT Technology Review]] |year=2007 | access-date=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 23, 2008, Zuckerberg announced [[Facebook Platform#Facebook Connect|Facebook Connect]], a version of Facebook Platform for users.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Internet.org===
In a public Facebook post, Zuckerberg launched the [[Free Basics|Internet.org]] project in late August 2013. He explained that the primary aim of the initiative is to provide Internet access to the five billion people who are not connected as of the launch date. Using a three-tier strategy, Internet.org will also create new jobs and open up new markets, according to Zuckerberg. He stated in his post:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The world economy is going through a massive transition right now. The knowledge economy is the future. By bringing everyone online, we'll not only improve billions of lives, but we'll also improve our own as we benefit from the ideas and productivity they contribute to the world. Giving everyone the opportunity to connect is the foundation for enabling the knowledge economy. It is not the only thing we need to do, but it's a fundamental and necessary step.&lt;ref name="Sew" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To stay proven on the efforts of bringing in the concept of [[net neutrality]], Zuckerberg met [[Narendra Modi]], [[Satya Nadella]] and [[Sundar Pichai]] at Silicon Valley, to discuss on how to effectively establish affordable [[internet]] access to the less developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/at-facebook-we-also-believe-in-net-neutrality-very-strongly-mark-zuckerberg/ |title=Meet at the Silicon Valley among the tech leaders and Indian Prime Minister-Narendra Modi|access-date= October 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a token of initiation, he changed his Facebook profile picture to extend his support to the [[Digital India]] to help the rural communities to stay connected to the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10102393263811931&amp;set=a.743613136151.2308566.4&amp;type=3&amp;permPage=1 |title=Mark Zuckerberg supports Digital India|access-date= October 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====ConnectU lawsuits====
{{Main|ConnectU}}
Harvard students [[Cameron Winklevoss]], [[Tyler Winklevoss]], and [[Divya Narendra]] accused Zuckerberg of intentionally making them believe he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com (later called [[ConnectU]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nicholas |last=Carlson |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-into-the-harvard-crimson-2010-3 |title=In 2004, Mark Zuckerberg Broke Into A Facebook User's Private Email Account |publisher=Silicon Alley Insider|access-date=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They filed a lawsuit in 2004, but it was dismissed on a technicality on March 28, 2007. It was refiled soon thereafter in [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|federal court]] in [[Boston]]. Facebook countersued in regards to Social Butterfly, a project put out by [[i2hub#The Winklevoss Chang Group|The Winklevoss Chang Group]], an alleged partnership between ConnectU and [[i2hub]]. On June 25, 2008, the case settled and Facebook agreed to transfer over 1.2 million common shares and pay $20 million in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Logged in as click here to log out |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/feb/12/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-ex-classmates |title=Facebook paid up to $65m to founder Mark Zuckerberg's ex-classmates |work=Guardian |location=UK |date=February 12, 2009|access-date=August 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, confidential court documents were posted on the website of ''[[02138]]'', a magazine that catered to Harvard alumni.

====Pakistan criminal investigation====
In June 2010, [[Pakistan]]i Deputy Attorney General Muhammad Azhar Sidiqque launched a criminal investigation into Zuckerberg and Facebook co-founders [[Dustin Moskovitz]] and [[Chris Hughes]] after a "[[Everybody Draw Mohammed Day|Draw Muhammad]]" contest was hosted on Facebook. The investigation named the anonymous German woman who created the contest. Sidiqque asked the country's police to contact [[Interpol]] to have Zuckerberg and the three others arrested for [[blasphemy law|blasphemy]]. On May 19, 2010, Facebook's website was temporarily blocked in Pakistan until Facebook removed the contest from its website at the end of May.

====Paul Ceglia====
{{Main|Paul Ceglia}}
In June 2010, Paul Ceglia, the owner of a wood [[pellet fuel]] company in [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany County, upstate New York]], filed suit against Zuckerberg, claiming 84 percent ownership of Facebook and seeking monetary damages. According to Ceglia, he and Zuckerberg signed a contract on April 28, 2003, that an initial fee of $1,000 entitled Ceglia to 50% of the website's revenue, as well as an additional 1% interest in the business per day after January 1, 2004, until website completion. Zuckerberg was developing other projects at the time, among which was ''Facemash'', the predecessor of Facebook, but did not register the domain name ''thefacebook.com'' until January 1, 2004. Facebook management dismissed the lawsuit as "completely frivolous". Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt told a reporter that Ceglia's counsel had unsuccessfully sought an out-of-court settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wellsvilledaily.com/article/20100729/NEWS/307299940 |title=Facebook does not have a like button for Ceglia |author=Anderson, John |publisher=WellsvilleDaily.com |date=July 29, 2010|access-date=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2010/07/20/zuckerberg-ceglia |title=Venture beat coverage of Ceglia lawsuit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, 2012, federal authorities arrested Ceglia, charging him with mail and wire fraud and of "tampering with, destroying and fabricating evidence in a scheme to defraud the Facebook founder of billions of dollars." Ceglia is accused of fabricating emails to make it appear that he and Zuckerberg discussed details about an early version of Facebook, although after examining their emails, investigators found there was no mention of Facebook in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/Feds-Collar-Would-Be-Facebook-Fraudster-76504.html |title=Feds Collar Would-Be Facebook Fraudster |publisher=E-Commerce News |date=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some law firms withdrew from the case before it was initiated and others after Ceglia's arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/10/29/a-dubious-case-found-lawyers-eager-to-make-some-money/ |title=A Dubious Case Found Lawyers Eager to Make Some Money |newspaper=New York Times |date=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_21887915/paul-ceglias-lawyer-drops-out-facebook-suit-after |title=Paul Ceglia's lawyer drops out of Facebook suit after arrest |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News |date=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hawaiian land ownership====
In January 2017, Zuckerberg filed eight "[[quiet title]] and [[Partition (law)|partition]]" lawsuits against hundreds of [[native Hawaiians]] to get them to sell their land to him. This land is contained within the 700 [[acre]]s of land in the Hawaiian island of [[Kauai]] that Zuckerberg had purchased in 2014.

===''The Social Network''===
{{Main|The Social Network}}
A movie based on Zuckerberg and the founding years of Facebook, ''[[The Social Network]]'' was released on October 1, 2010, starring [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Zuckerberg. After Zuckerberg was told about the film, he responded, "I just wished that nobody made a movie of me while I was still alive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=June 26, 2010 |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-20006653-56.html?tag=mncol;title |title=Zuckerberg in the hot seat at D8 |publisher=CNET |date=June 2, 2010 |author=Fried, Ina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, after the film's script was leaked on the Internet and it was apparent that the film would not portray Zuckerberg in a wholly positive light, he stated that he wanted to establish himself as a "good guy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|access-date=July 18, 2010 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article7127721.ece |title=Movie depicts seamy life of Facebook boss |work=The Times Online |date=May 16, 2010 |author=Harlow, John |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is based on the book ''[[The Accidental Billionaires]]'' by [[Ben Mezrich]], which the book's publicist once described as "big juicy fun" rather than "reportage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|access-date=September 22, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/21/business/media/21facebook.html?_r=1 |title=Facebook Feels Unfriendly Toward Film It Inspired |work=The New York Times |date=August 20, 2010 |author1=Cieply, Michael |author2=Helft, Miguel |lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's screenwriter [[Aaron Sorkin]] told [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]], "I don't want my fidelity to be the truth; I want it to be storytelling", adding, "What is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracy's sake, and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=September 22, 2010 |url=http://nymag.com/movies/features/68319 |title=Inventing Facebook |publisher=New York |date=September 17, 2010 |author=Harris, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon winning the [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Picture on January 16, 2011, producer [[Scott Rudin]] thanked Facebook and Zuckerberg "for his willingness to allow us to use his life and work as a [[metaphor]] through which to tell a story about communication and the way we relate to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://techland.time.com/2011/01/17/the-social-network-filmmakers-thank-zuckerberg-during-golden-globes/ |title=The Social Network Filmmakers Thank Zuckerberg During Golden Globes |publisher=Time |work=Techland |date=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sorkin, who won for Best Screenplay, retracted some of the impressions given in his script:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/01/aaron_sorkin.html |title=Last Night, Aaron Sorkin Demonstrated How to Apologize Without Accepting Responsibility |journal=NYMag |date=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, 2011, Zuckerberg made a surprise guest appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', which was being hosted by Jesse Eisenberg. They both said it was the first time they ever met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=January 30, 2011 |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20462104,00.html |title=Mark Zuckerberg Meets Jesse Eisenberg on Saturday Night Live |publisher=[[People (magazine)|People]] |date=January 30, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131034819/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20462104,00.html |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenberg asked Zuckerberg, who had been critical of his portrayal by the film, what he thought of the movie.

He adds, "Mark has been so gracious about something thats really so uncomfortable&amp;nbsp;... The fact that he would do ''SNL'' and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous.

====Disputed accuracy====
Jeff Jarvis, author of the book ''Public Parts'', interviewed Zuckerberg and believes Sorkin made up too much of the story. He states, "That's what the internet is accused of doing, making stuff up, not caring about the facts."&lt;ref name=BBCmovie&gt;Rohrer, Finlo. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11437873 "Is the Facebook movie the truth about Mark Zuckerberg"] BBC, September 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

According to David Kirkpatrick, former technology editor at ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine and author of ''The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company That Is Connecting the World,'' (2011),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1439102120 "The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company That Is Connecting the World"], release date February 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; "the film is only "40% true&amp;nbsp;... he is not snide and sarcastic in a cruel way, the way Zuckerberg is played in the movie." He says that "a lot of the factual incidents are accurate, but many are distorted and the overall impression is false", and concludes that primarily "his motivations were to try and come up with a new way to share information on the Internet".&lt;ref name=BBCmovie /&gt;

Although the film portrays Zuckerberg's creation of Facebook in order to elevate his stature after not getting into any of the elite [[Officially unrecognized Harvard College social clubs|final clubs]] at Harvard, Zuckerberg said he had no interest in joining the clubs.&lt;ref name="NEWYORKER2010" /&gt; Kirkpatrick agrees that the impression implied by the film is "false". Karel Baloun, a former senior engineer at Facebook, notes that the "image of Zuckerberg as a socially inept nerd is overstated&amp;nbsp;... It is fiction&amp;nbsp;..." He likewise dismisses the film's assertion that he "would deliberately betray a friend".&lt;ref name=BBCmovie /&gt;

===Other depictions===
Zuckerberg voiced himself on an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' titled "[[Loan-a Lisa]]", which first aired on October 3, 2010.

On February 24, 2016, Zuckerberg sent out a company-wide internal memo to employees formally rebuking employees who had crossed out handwritten "[[Black Lives Matter]]" phrases on the company walls and had written "All Lives Matter" in their place. Facebook allows employees to free-write thoughts and phrases on company walls. The memo was then leaked by several employees. As Zuckerberg had previously condemned this practice at previous company meetings, and other similar requests had been issued by other leaders at Facebook, Zuckerberg wrote in the memo that he would now consider this overwriting practice not only disrespectful, but "malicious as well." According to Zuckerberg's memo, "''Black Lives Matter'' doesn't mean other lives don't -- it's simply asking that the black community also achieves the justice they deserve." The memo also noted that the act of crossing something out in itself, "means silencing speech, or that one person's speech is more important than another's." Zuckerberg also said in the memo that he would be launching investigations into the incidents.&lt;ref name="shaunking-zuckerberg"&gt;{{cite news |last1=King |first1=Shaun |title=Mark Zuckerberg forced to address racism among Facebook staff after vandals target Black Lives Matter phrases |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/king-mark-zuckerberg-forced-address-racism-facebook-article-1.2543985|access-date=February 26, 2016 |agency=[[New York Daily News]] |date=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guynn"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jessica |first1=Guynn |title=Zuckerberg reprimands Facebook staff defacing 'Black Lives Matter' slogan |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/02/25/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-black-lives-matter-diversity/80933694/|access-date=February 26, 2016 |agency=[[USA Today]] |date=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="benjaminsnyder"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Snyder |first1=Benjamin |title=Mark Zuckerberg Takes Facebook Workers to Task Over "All Lives Matter" Graffiti |url=http://fortune.com/2016/02/25/mark-zuckerberg-black-lives-matter/|access-date=February 26, 2016 |agency=[[Fortune (magazine)]] |date=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York's ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' interviewed Facebook employees who commented anonymously that, "Zuckerberg was genuinely angry about the incident and it really encouraged staff that Zuckerberg showed a clear understanding of why the phrase 'Black Lives Matter' must exist, as well as why writing through it is a form of harassment and erasure."&lt;ref name="shaunking-zuckerberg"/&gt;
