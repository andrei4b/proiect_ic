"The city had a huge influence on me because it's such a diverse place. As hard as [growing up in it was], I always felt very blessed about being able to recognize different cultures and styles, people and places. I feel like the concrete alone just gave me a certain drive. I really saw everything: every negative I could possibly see from the time I could walk until now; and also every positive, every bright future, every dream that I could possibly see.

Its difficult, especially when youre so young - I started really young, at 16/17 - and being able to have access to so many things, it can be a difficult choice sometimes. I give thanks that where I grew up kind of prepared me for that so that I could have a particular focus, cause I didnt want to end up like so many people that I saw on the street every day."}}&lt;/ref&gt; She credits her "tough" mother for anchoring her on a right path as opposed to many people she knew who ended up on the wrong path and in jail. Keys attributed her unusual maturity as a young girl to her mother, who depended on her to be responsible while she worked to provide for them and give Keys as many opportunities as possible.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chrissy"/&gt;

Keys loved music and singing from early childhood.

Keen on dissecting music, Keys continued developing her songwriting and finding her own 'flow and style" through her exploration of the intricacies in different music.&lt;ref name="ASCAP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Will"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neal"/&gt; 

{{Quote box|width=28%|quote=Classical piano totally helped me to be a better songwriter and a better musician...I knew the fundamentals of music.

Keys spent more time in [[Harlem]] during her teenage years. She connected with the cultural and racial diversity in the neighborhood, where she expanded upon her musical exploration, and her character was also solidified. "Harlem raised me in a lot of ways," Keys remarked. "[It] taught me how to think fast, how to play the game...taught me leadership, how to get out of bad situations when you need to, how to hold my own."&lt;ref name="Toure"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian Interview"/&gt; During this period, she met her friend and future collaborator [[Kerry Brothers Jr.]]&lt;ref name="Merritt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Toure"/&gt; 

In 1994, manager Jeff Robinson met 13-year old Keys, who participated in his brother's youth organization, Teens in Motion.&lt;ref name="crain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mycrains.crainsnewyork.com/40under40/profiles/2003/32 |title=Crain's 40 Under 40 Alumni|work=[[Crain's New York Business]]|year=2003|accessdate=May 30, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808134712/http://mycrains.crainsnewyork.com/40under40/profiles/2003/32|archivedate=August 8, 2008|first=Valerie|last=Block}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole"/&gt; Robinson's brother had been giving Keys vocal lessons in Harlem.&lt;ref name="Roberts"/&gt; His brother had talked to him about Keys and advised him to go see her, but Robinson shrugged it off as he had "heard that story 1,000 times". At the time, Keys was part of a three-girl band that had formed in the [[Bronx]] and was performing in Harlem.&lt;ref name="Cole"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boom"/&gt; Robinson eventually agreed to his brother's request, and went to see Keys perform with her group at the Police Athletic Center league in Harlem. He was soon taken by her, her singing, playing classical music and performing her own songs.&lt;ref name="Cole"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Toure"/&gt; Robinson was excited by audiences' incredulous reactions to her. Impressed by her talents, charisma, image, and maturity, Robinson considered her to be the "total package", and took her under his wing.&lt;ref name="crain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times"/&gt; By this time, Keys had already written two of the songs that she would later include on her debut album, "Butterflyz" and "The Life".&lt;ref name="NY Times"/&gt; 

Robinson wanted Keys to be fully informed and ready for the music industry, so he took her everywhere with him, including all the meetings with attorneys and negotiations with record labels, while the teenager often became disgruntled with the process.&lt;ref name="Cole"/&gt; Robinson had urged Keys to pursue a solo career, as she remained reluctant, preferring the musical interactions of a group. She took Robinson's advice after her group disbanded, and contacted Robinson who in 1995 introduced her to [[A&amp;R]] executive [[Peter Edge]]. Edge later described his first impressions of Keys to [[HitQuarters]]: {{quote|"I remember that I felt, upon meeting her, that she was completely unique. I had never met a young R&amp;B artist with that level of musicianship. So many people were just singing on top of loops and tracks, but she had the ability, not only to be part of hip-hop, but also to go way beyond that.

Robinson and Edge helped Keys assemble some demos of songs she had written and set up a showcase for label executives.&lt;ref name="Merritt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Toure"/&gt; Keys performed on the piano for executives of various labels, and a bidding war ensued.&lt;ref name="Oprah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Toure"/&gt; Edge was keen to sign Keys himself but was unable to do so at that time due to being on the verge of leaving his present record company, [[Warner Bros.

In May 2016, Keys initiated a #NoMakeup movement, where she wrote on ''[[Lenny Letter|Lenny]]'' "Before I started my new album, I wrote a list of all the things that I was sick of. And one was how much women are brainwashed into feeling like we have to be skinny, or sexy, or desirable, or perfect. One of the many things I was tired of was the constant judgment of women. The constant stereotyping through every medium that makes us feel like being a normal size is not normal, and heaven forbid if you're plus-size. Or the constant message that being sexy means being naked".&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.lennyletter.com/style/a410/alicia-keys-time-to-uncover/ |title= Alicia Keys: Time to Uncover |website=[[Lenny Letter]] |accessdate= February 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keys presented her movement at various events,&lt;ref name="MTV"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/alicia-keys-rocked-no-makeup-non-celebrities-article-1.2776118|title=Here's why people are annoyed at Alicia Keys |website=[[New York Daily News]] |accessdate= February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received a range of both complimentary and critical responses.&lt;ref name="Buzzfeed"/&gt;
