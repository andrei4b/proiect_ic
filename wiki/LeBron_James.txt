'''LeBron Raymone James Sr.''' ({{IPAc-en|l|||b|r||n}}; born December 30, 1984) is an American professional [[basketball]] player for the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA).

James played high school basketball for [[St. VincentSt. Mary High School]] in his hometown of [[Akron, Ohio]], where he was heavily touted in the national media as a future NBA superstar. James joined the Cavaliers in [[2003 NBA draft|2003]] as the [[List of first overall NBA draft picks|first overall draft pick]]. He quickly emerged as a league star and concluded his first season by winning the [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]]. James would go on to establish himself as one of the premier players in the NBA with multiple accolades including being given the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award]] in 2009 and 2010. After falling short of the championship expectations set by the media, fans, and himself, James departed Cleveland in 2010 as a free agent to sign with the [[Miami Heat]]. This move was announced in an [[ESPN]] special titled ''[[The Decision (TV special)|The Decision]]'' and is one of the most talked-about free agent decisions in American sports history.

In Miami, James would capture his first NBA championship in [[2012 NBA Finals|2012]] and followed that with another title [[2013 NBA Finals|a year later]]. He was named NBA MVP and NBA Finals MVP both championship years as well. In 2014, James would opt out of his contract with Miami after four seasons to re-sign with the Cavaliers. In [[2016 NBA Finals|2016]], James would lead the Cavaliers to their first NBA championship by defeating the [[Golden State Warriors]] to end [[Cleveland sports curse|Cleveland's 52-year professional sports title drought]].

==Early life==
James was born on December 30, 1984 in [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], [[Ohio]] to a 16-year-old mother, Gloria Marie James. His father, Anthony McClelland, was reportedly Gloria's casual boyfriend with an extensive criminal record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Donegan|first=Lawrence|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/mar/02/ussport|title=America's most wanted|work=theguardian.com|date=March 2, 2003|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newsone.com/2908971/lebron-james-instagram-letter-to-father/|title=LeBron James Posts An Instagram For His Dad Thanking Him For Nothing|work=newsone.com|date=February 21, 2014|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gloria raised the child on her own.&lt;ref name="Jones2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Ryan |title=King James: Believe the Hype |year=2003 |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |location=New York |isbn=0-312-34992-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}} When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work.&lt;ref name=jockbio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/James/James_bio.html|title=LeBron James Biography|website=JockBio.com|accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach, who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.&lt;ref name="Jones2003" /&gt;{{rp|23}}

As a youth, James played [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars.&lt;ref name=jockbio /&gt; The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee.&lt;ref name="Jones2003" /&gt;{{rp|24}} The players were inseparable and dubbed themselves the "Fab Four", promising each other that they would attend high school together.&lt;ref name="Jones2003" /&gt;{{rp|27}} In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend [[St. VincentSt. Mary High School]], a predominately [[Caucasian race|white]] private [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Covert|first=Colin|title=Movie review: Band of brothers in 'More Than a Game' |url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/movies/64387712.html?elr=KArksD:aDyaEP:kD:aUnc5PDiUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aULPQL7PQLanchO7DiUr|publisher=''[[Star Tribune]]''|accessdate=July 1, 2012|date=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LeBron James, SVSM teammates to enter school's hall of fame: High school newswatch|url=http://highschoolsports.cleveland.com/news/article/-1627030445399566344/lebron-james-svsm-teammates-to-enter-schools-hall-of-fame-high-school-newswatch/|website=cleveland.com|accessdate=July 1, 2012|date=August 22, 2013|author=Plain Dealer Staff Reports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a freshman, James averaged 21 [[point (basketball)|points]] and 6 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] per game for the St. Vincent-St. Mary [[Varsity sports|varsity]] basketball team.&lt;ref name=Prospect&gt;{{cite web|title=Prospect Profile: LeBron James|url=http://www.nba.com/draft2003/profiles/JamesLeBron.html|website=NBA.com|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fighting Irish finished the year 270, winning the Division III state title.&lt;ref name=Prospect /&gt; As a sophomore, James averaged 25.2 points and 7.2 rebounds with 5.8 [[assist (basketball)|assists]] and 3.8 [[steal (basketball)|steals]] per game.&lt;ref name="nbabio"/&gt; For some home games during the season, St. Vincent-St. Mary played at the [[University of Akron]]'s 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, and college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play.&lt;ref name="Jones2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abrams|first=Jonathan|title=Heading Home to Celebrate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/03/sports/basketball/03lebron.html|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=May 30, 2012|date=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fighting Irish finished the season 261 and repeated as state champions.&lt;ref name=Prospect /&gt; For his outstanding play, James was named [[Ohio Mr. Basketball]] and selected to the [[USA Today All-USA high school basketball team|''USA Today'' All-USA First Team]], becoming the first sophomore to do either.&lt;ref name=Prospect /&gt;

Prior to the start of his junior year, James appeared in ''[[SLAM Magazine]]'' and writer Ryan Jones lauded him as possibly "the best high school basketball player in America right now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Ryan|title=Ohio Player|url=http://www.slamonline.com/online/the-magazine/features/2012/05/ohio-player-lebron-james-first/|publisher=''[[SLAM Magazine]]''|accessdate=May 27, 2012|date=December 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the season, he appeared on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', becoming the first high school basketball underclassman to do so.&lt;ref name="Jones2003" /&gt;{{rp|104}} With averages of 29 points, 8.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, and 3.3 steals per game, he was again named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the ''USA Today'' All-USA First Team,&lt;ref name=Prospect /&gt; and became the first junior to be named boys' basketball [[Gatorade National Player of the Year]].&lt;ref name="Jones2003" /&gt;{{rp|117}} St. Vincent-St. Mary finished the year with a 234 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game.&lt;ref name="Jones2003" /&gt;{{rp|114}} Following the loss, James unsuccessfully petitioned for a change to the NBA's draft eligibility rules, which required prospective players to have at least a high school diploma, in an attempt to enter the [[2002 NBA draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/books/09garner.html|title=An N.B.A. Giant and How He Grew|accessdate=May 3, 2010|date=September 9, 2009|page=C1|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Garner, Dwight}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he used [[marijuana]], which he said was to help cope with the stress that resulted from the constant media attention he was receiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=January 30, 2018|date=July 24, 2009|title=LeBron's Book Shows Struggle With Fame|newspaper=[[CBS News]]|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/07/24/entertainment/main5185971.shtml|last=Withers|first=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Garcia|first=Julian|date=July 23, 2009|accessdate=January 30, 2018|title=The pot thickens: LeBron James admits smoking marijuana as a high school junior in new book|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/pot-thickens-lebron-james-admits-smoking-marijuana-high-school-junior-new-book-article-1.428029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Livingston|first=Bill|date=July 22, 2009|accessdate=January 30, 2018|title=New LeBron James book tells of a 'shooting star' always willing to learn lessons|newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]]|url=http://www.cleveland.com/livingston/index.ssf/2009/07/new_lebron_james_book_tells_of.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled around the country to play a number of nationally ranked teams, including a game against [[Oak Hill Academy (Mouth of Wilson, Virginia)|Oak Hill Academy]] that was nationally televised on [[ESPN2]].&lt;ref name="Jones2003" /&gt;{{rp|142}} [[Time Warner Cable]], looking to capitalize on James's popularity, offered St. Vincent-St. Mary's games to subscribers on a [[pay-per-view]] basis throughout the season.&lt;ref name="Jones2003" /&gt;{{rp|143}} For the year, James averaged 31.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 3.4 steals per game,&lt;ref name=Prospect /&gt; was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the ''USA Today'' All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year,&lt;ref name="Jones2003" /&gt;{{rp|178}}&lt;ref name=Prospect /&gt; and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year.&lt;ref name=Prospect /&gt; He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star gamesthe [[EA Sports]] [[Roundball Classic]], the [[Jordan Brand Classic|Jordan Capital Classic]], and the [[2003 McDonald's All-American Boys Game|McDonald's All-American Game]]losing his [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) eligibility and making it official that he would enter the 2003 NBA draft.&lt;ref name=Free/&gt; Many basketball analysts, scouts, and writers have remarked that James left high school as one of the best and most [[Media circus|hyped]] prospects of all-time.&lt;ref name="Jones2003" /&gt;{{rp|142}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bilas|first1=Jay|title=Did 'LeBron Mania' go too far?|url=http://www.espn.com/columns/bilas_jay/1477784.html|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=December 17, 2002|accessdate=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Broussard|first1=Chris|title=James Answers the Hype with Standout Debut|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/30/sports/basketball-james-answers-hype-with-standout-debut.html|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=October 30, 2003|accessdate=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Sam|title=Hype over LeBron doesn't match Alcindor's|url=http://a.espncdn.com/nba/columns/smith_sam/1475855.html|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=December 12, 2003|accessdate=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ford|first1=Chad|title=Top 25 draft prospects since 2000|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/draft2014/insider/story/_/id/11099139/nba-draft-lebron-james-leads-rank-top-25-draft-prospects-last-15-years|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=June 18, 2014|accessdate=August 6, 2017|website=[[ESPN.com|ESPN Insider]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also during his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, he skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a [[Hummer H2]] from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing LeBron's future earning power as an NBA superstar.&lt;ref name=SUV&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=January 27, 2003|accessdate=March 8, 2009|title=Prep star James can continue drive for state title|url=http://static.espn.go.com/nba/news/2003/0127/1499490.html|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted an investigation by the [[Ohio High School Athletic Association]] (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the gift from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source.&lt;ref name=Free/&gt; Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in him being stripped of his high school sports eligibility.&lt;ref name=Free&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=January 31, 2003|accessdate=March 8, 2009|agency=ESPN.com News Services|title=James ruled ineligible, plans to appeal decision|url=http://static.espn.go.com/nba/news/2003/0131/1502001.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year.
