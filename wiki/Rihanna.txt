==Career==
===20032005: Beginnings and debut===
In 2003, Rihanna formed a musical trio with two of her classmates.&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt; She was discovered in her home country of [[Barbados]] by American record producer [[Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers|Evan Rogers]]. Without a name or any material, the [[girl group]] managed to land an audition with Rogers who commented, "The minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didn't exist".&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt; Rihanna went to Rogers' hotel room, where she performed renditions of [[Destiny's Child]]'s "[[Emotion (Samantha Sang song)#Emotion (Samantha Sang song)|Emotion]]" and [[Mariah Carey]]'s "[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]]".&lt;ref name="TheGuardian1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Patterson|first=Sylvia|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/26/popandrock|title=Singing in the rain|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media|date=27 August 2007|accessdate=24 September 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed, Rogers scheduled a second meeting with her mother present, and then invited her to his hometown in the [[United States]] to record some [[Demo (music)|demo]] tapes which could be sent to record labels.&lt;ref name="TheGuardian1"/&gt; She recorded the demo over the next year intermittently, due to only being able to record during school holidays. "Pon de Replay" and "The Last Time" were two tracks recorded for the demo tape, which were eventually included on her debut album ''Music of the Sun''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |url=http://www.boomsbeat.com/articles/153/20140127/50-interesting-facts-about-rihanna.htm |title=50 Interesting Facts About Rihanna |work= |publisher=Booms Beat |date=27 January 2014 |accessdate=20 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302123317/http://www.boomsbeat.com/articles/153/20140127/50-interesting-facts-about-rihanna.htm |archivedate=2 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGidBbtrM08|title=2005 Rihanna Interview|work=|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=|accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Rihanna was signed to Rogers' and [[Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers|Carl Sturken]]'s production company, Syndicated Rhythm Productions.&lt;ref name="TheGuardian1"/&gt;

Rihanna's demo was shipped out to [[Def Jam Recordings]], where Jay Brown, an [[Artists and repertoire|A&amp;R]] executive at the [[record label]], was one of the first to hear the demo. Brown played the demo tape for [[rapper]] [[Jay-Z]], who had recently been appointed as president and [[Chief executive officer]] (CEO) of Def Jam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universalmusic.com/corporate/detail/231 |title=THE ISLAND DEF JAM MUSIC GROUP APPOINTS SHAWN "JAY-Z" CARTER TO PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, DEF JAM RECORDINGS |publisher=[[Universal Music Group]] |date=8 December 2004 |accessdate=22 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317183153/http://www.universalmusic.com/corporate/detail/231 |archivedate=17 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Jay-Z first heard the track "[[Pon de Replay]]", he felt the song was too big for her.&lt;ref name="Jay-ZPicks"&gt;{{cite web|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/yhif/jayz_picks/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830053302/http://www.mtv.com/news/yhif/jayz_picks/|archivedate=30 August 2011|title=Jay-Z's Picks: Teairra Mari, Rihanna, Ne-Yo|publisher=MTV|accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being skeptical, he invited Rihanna to audition for the label.

She waited in Jay-Z's office until three in the morning to get lawyers to draft up a contract because he wanted to prevent her from signing with another label.&lt;ref name="Jay-ZPicks"/&gt;
Rihanna cancelled other meetings with record labels and relocated from Barbados to the United States to live with Rogers and his wife.&lt;ref name="RollingStone1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Eells|first=Josh|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/rihanna-queen-of-pain-rolling-stones-2011-cover-story-20110606?page=5|title=Rihanna, Queen of Pain: Rolling Stone's 2011 Cover Story|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=1 June 2011|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
