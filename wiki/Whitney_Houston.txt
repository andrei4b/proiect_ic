Houston spent some of her teenage years touring nightclubs where her mother, Cissy, was performing, and she would occasionally get on stage and perform with her. In 1977, at age 14, she became a backup singer on the [[Michael Zager Band]]'s single "Life's a Party".&lt;ref name="Bronson2003ad"/&gt; In 1978, at age 15, Houston sang background vocals for [[Chaka Khan]] and [[Lou Rawls]].&lt;ref name="Comp"&gt;{{vcite book|work=Jet|title=Singer Whitney Houston a Model of Success |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ra8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32|date=July 16, 1990|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|page=32|issn=0021-5996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, Houston started working as a fashion model after a photographer saw her at [[Carnegie Hall]] singing with her mother.

Houston had previously been offered several recording agencies (Michael Zager in 1980, and [[Elektra Records]] in 1981), but her mother declined the offers stating her daughter must first complete high school.&lt;ref name="Bronson2003ad"&gt;{{vcite book|first=Fred | last = Bronson|title=The Billboard book of number 1 hits|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&amp;pg=PT629|date=October 1, 2003|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-0-8230-7677-2|page=629}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1990Company"&gt;{{vcite book|work=Ebony|title=Girl|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8tMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA136|date=June 1990|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|page=136|issn=0012-9011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Gerry Griffith, an A&amp;R representative from [[Arista Records]], saw her performing with her mother in a New York City nightclub and was impressed. He convinced Arista's head [[Clive Davis]] to make time to see Houston perform. Davis was impressed and immediately offered a worldwide recording contract which Houston signed. Later that year, she made her national televised debut alongside Davis on ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]''.&lt;ref name="Company1985"&gt;{{vcite book|title=Ebony|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JtkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA155|date=December 1985|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|page=155|issn=0012-9011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19851986: Rise to international prominence===
With production from [[Michael Masser]], [[Kashif (musician)|Kashif]], [[Jermaine Jackson]], and [[Narada Michael Walden]], Houston's debut album ''[[Whitney Houston (album)|Whitney Houston]]'' was released in February 1985. ''Rolling Stone'' magazine praised Houston, calling her "one of the most exciting new voices in years" while ''The New York Times'' called the album "an impressive, musically conservative showcase for an exceptional vocal talent".&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web| first= Don | last= Shewey | title= Music Review: ''Whitney Houston'' | date = June 6, 1985|work=Rolling Stone | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/whitney-houston-19850606| accessdate=March 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news| last = Holden | first = Stephen | title = Critic's Choice; Pop Music | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/12/arts/critics-choices-pop-music.html | newspaper = The New York Times | page = A2 |date = May 12, 1985 | accessdate =March 5, 2008 | authorlink = Stephen Holden }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arista Records promoted Houston's album with three different singles from the album in the US, UK and other European countries. In the UK, the dance-funk "Someone for Me", which failed to chart in the country, was the first single while "[[All at Once (Whitney Houston song)|All at Once]]" was in such European countries as the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]], where the song reached the top 5 on the singles charts, respectively.&lt;ref name="Inc.1985"&gt;{{vcite book|title=Whitney Houston's Success Is Global|work=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8yQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT54|accessdate=February 13, 2012|date=June 8, 1985|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=54|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, the soulful ballad "[[You Give Good Love]]" was chosen as the [[lead single]] from Houston's debut to establish her in the black marketplace first.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news | first = Paul| last = Grein | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-08/entertainment/ca-9249_1/3 | title = Houston Hits: Master Plan, Blind Luck | publisher = [[Tribune Company]] |work=Los Angeles Times | date = June 8, 1986 | accessdate =October 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the US, the song failed to get enough attention to become a hit, but in the US, it gave the album its first major hit as it peaked at No. 3 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, and No. 1 on the [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot R&amp;B]] chart.&lt;ref name="Billboard86"/&gt; As a result, the album began to sell strongly, and Houston continued promotion by touring nightclubs in the US. She also began performing on late-night television talk shows, which were not usually accessible to unestablished black acts. The jazzy ballad "[[Saving All My Love for You]]" was released next and it would become Houston's first No. 1 single in both the US and the UK. She was then an opening act for singer [[Jeffrey Osborne]] on his nationwide tour. "[[Thinking About You (Whitney Houston song)|Thinking About You]]" was released as the promo single only to R&amp;B-oriented radio stations, which peaked at number ten on the US R&amp;B Chart. At the time, MTV had received harsh criticism for not playing enough videos by black, Latino, and other racial minorities while favoring white acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite episode|title=Whitney Houston |series=Headliners And Legends |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036702/ |airdate=August 11, 2000 |season= |number= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021140553/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036702 |archivedate=October 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The third US single, "[[How Will I Know]]", peaked at No. 1, and the video introduced Houston to the MTV audience. Houston's subsequent singles from this, and future albums, would make her the first African-American woman to receive consistent heavy rotation on MTV.&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt;

By 1986, a year after its initial release, ''Whitney Houston'' topped the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart and stayed there for 14 non-consecutive weeks.&lt;ref name="Inc.1986"&gt;{{vcite book|title=Charts '86|work=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tiQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA52|date=December 27, 1986|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=52|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final single, "Greatest Love of All", a cover of "[[The Greatest Love of All]]", originally recorded by [[George Benson]] in 1977, became Houston's biggest hit at the time after peaking No. 1 and remaining there for three weeks on the Hot 100 chart, which made her debut the first album by a woman to yield three No. 1 hits.

With many expectations, Houston's second album, ''[[Whitney (album)|Whitney]]'', was released in June 1987. The album again featured production from Masser, Kashif and Walden as well as [[Jellybean Benitez]]. Many critics complained that the material was too similar to her previous album.

Houston became the first woman in music history to debut at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart, and the first artist to enter the albums chart at number one in both the US and UK, while also hitting number one or top ten in dozens of other countries around the world. The album's first single, "[[I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)]]", was also a massive hit worldwide, peaking at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and topping the singles chart in many countries such as Australia, Germany and the UK. The next three singles, "[[Didn't We Almost Have It All]]", "[[So Emotional]]", and "[[Where Do Broken Hearts Go]]" all peaked at number one on the US Hot 100 chart, which gave her a total of seven consecutive number one hits, breaking the record of six previously shared by [[The Beatles]] and the [[Bee Gees]].&lt;ref name="Company1988a"&gt;{{vcite book|author=Johnson Publishing Company|title=Jet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WLADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA54|date=May 2, 1988|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|page=54|issn=0021-5996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Inc.2000"&gt;{{vcite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JQ8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA104|date=May 13, 2000|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=104|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houston became the first woman to generate four number-one singles from one album.

Houston took a more urban direction with her third studio album, ''[[I'm Your Baby Tonight]]'', released in November 1990. She produced and chose producers for this album and as a result, it featured production and collaborations with [[L.A. Reid]] and [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]], [[Luther Vandross]], and [[Stevie Wonder]]. The album showed Houston's versatility on a new batch of tough rhythmic grooves, soulful ballads and up-tempo dance tracks. Reviews were mixed. ''Rolling Stone'' felt it was her "best and most integrated album".&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web | first = James |last=Hunter | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/im-your-baby-tonight-19910110 | title = Review: ''I'm Your Baby Tonight'' | publisher = [[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media, LLC]] | date = January 10, 1991 | accessdate =March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', at the time thought Houston's shift towards an urban direction was "superficial".&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web | author = Browne, David | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318684,00.html | title = Music Review: ''I'm Your Baby Tonight'' | publisher = [[Time Warner]] | date = November 23, 1990 | accessdate =March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album contained several hits: the first two singles, "[[I'm Your Baby Tonight (song)|I'm Your Baby Tonight]]" and "[[All the Man That I Need]]" peaked at number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart; "[[Miracle (Whitney Houston song)|Miracle]]" peaked at number nine; "[[My Name Is Not Susan]]" peaked in the top twenty; "[[I Belong to You (Whitney Houston song)|I Belong to You]]" reached the top ten of the US R&amp;B chart and garnered Houston a Grammy nomination; and the sixth single, the Stevie Wonder duet "[[We Didn't Know]]", reached the R&amp;B top twenty. The album peaked at number three on the ''Billboard'' 200 and went on to be certified 4 platinum in the US while selling 12 million total worldwide.

In 1990, Houston was the spokesperson for a youth leadership conference hosted in Washington, D.C. She had a private audience with President George H. W. Bush in the Oval Office to discuss the associated challenges.

===19921994: Marriage, motherhood, and ''The Bodyguard''===
Throughout the 1980s, Houston was romantically linked to [[American football]] star [[Randall Cunningham]] and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].&lt;ref name="Norment-1991" /&gt; She then met R&amp;B singer [[Bobby Brown]] at the 1989 Soul Train Music Awards.

The film's soundtrack also enjoyed success. Houston executive-produced and contributed six songs for the motion picture's [[The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album|adjoining soundtrack album]].

===19951997: ''Waiting to Exhale'', ''The Preacher's Wife'', and ''Cinderella''===
In 1995, Houston starred alongside [[Angela Bassett]], [[Loretta Devine]], and [[Lela Rochon]] in her second film, ''[[Waiting to Exhale]]'', a motion picture about four African-American women struggling with relationships. Houston played the lead character Savannah Jackson, a TV producer in love with a married man. She chose the role because she saw the film as "a breakthrough for the image of black women because it presents them both as professionals and as caring mothers".&lt;ref name=prissy/&gt; After opening at number one and grossing $67 million in the US at the box office and $81 million worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=waitingtoexhale.htm |title=Waiting to Exhale (1995) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date=March 2, 1996 |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it proved that a movie primarily targeting a black audience can cross over to success, while paving the way for other all-black movies such as ''[[How Stella Got Her Groove Back]]'' and the [[Tyler Perry]] movies that became popular in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/africanambib2.html |title=African American Filmmakers, African American Films: A Bibliography of Materials in the UC Berkeley Library|location=Berkeley, CA|publisher= UC Berkeley Library |accessdate=February 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ascher-Walsh, Rebecca | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,284411,00.html | title=Back in the Groove?| work=Entertainment Weekly| date=August 14, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=LaPorte, Nicole | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117918919.html?categoryid=1055&amp;cs=1 |title=Diary of a Mad Niche Hit|magazine=Variety|date= March 6, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is also notable for its portrayal of black women as strong middle class citizens rather than as stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| first= Jack E. | last= White | title= Heavy Breathing |date=January 15, 1996|magazine=Time | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983966,00.html| accessdate=March 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reviews were mainly positive for the ensemble cast.

The film's accompanying soundtrack, ''[[Waiting to Exhale: Original Soundtrack Album]]'', was written and produced by [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]]. Though he originally wanted Houston to record the entire album, she declined. Instead, she "wanted it to be an album of women with vocal distinction", and thus gathered several African-American female artists for the soundtrack, to go along with the film's message about strong women.&lt;ref name=prissy&gt;{{cite magazine| first= Christopher John | last= Farley | title= No More Prissy |date=December 4, 1995|magazine=Time | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983795-2,00.html| accessdate=March 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the album featured a range of contemporary R&amp;B female recording artists along with Houston, such as [[Mary J.

Houston's "[[Exhale (Shoop Shoop)]]" peaked at No. 1, and then spent a record eleven weeks at the No. 2 spot and eight weeks on top of the R&amp;B Charts. "Count On Me", a duet with [[CeCe Winans]], hit the U.S. Top 10; and Houston's third contribution, "[[Why Does It Hurt So Bad]]", made the Top 30.

In 1996, Houston starred in the holiday comedy ''[[The Preacher's Wife]]'', with [[Denzel Washington]]. She plays a gospel-singing wife of a pastor ([[Courtney B. Vance]]). It was largely an updated remake of the 1948 film ''[[The Bishop's Wife]]'', which starred [[Loretta Young]], [[David Niven]] and [[Cary Grant]].

===19982000: ''My Love Is Your Love'' and ''Whitney: The Greatest Hits''===
After spending much of the early and mid-1990s working on motion pictures and their soundtrack albums, Houston's first studio album in eight years, the critically acclaimed ''[[My Love Is Your Love]]'', was released in November 1998. Though originally slated to be a greatest hits album with a handful of new songs, recording sessions were so fruitful that a new full-length studio album was released. Recorded and mixed in only six weeks, it featured production from [[Rodney Jerkins]], [[Wyclef Jean]] and [[Missy Elliott]]. The album debuted at number thirteen, its peak position, on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal | journal = Billboard | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LgoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=RA1-PA126#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = The ''Billboard'' 200 chart listing for the week of December 5, 1998 | page = 126 | volume = 110 | issue = 49 | publisher = Nielsen Business Media, Inc. | issn = 0006-2510 | date = December 5, 1998 | accessdate =October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a funkier and edgier sound than past releases and saw Houston handling urban dance, [[hip hop music|hip hop]], mid-tempo [[R&amp;B]], [[reggae]], [[torch song]]s, and ballads all with great dexterity.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal | journal = Billboard | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IwoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA1| title = Houston Finds a New Groove with Arista Set | author = Melinda Newman | publisher = Nielsen Business Media, Inc. | pages = 1, 86 | volume = 110 | issue = 44 | issn = 0006-2510 | date = October 31, 1998 | accessdate =October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From late 1998 to early 2000, the album spawned several hit singles: "[[When You Believe]]" (US No. 15, UK No. 4), a duet with [[Mariah Carey]] for 1998's ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' [[The Prince of Egypt (soundtrack)|soundtrack]], which also became an international hit as it peaked in the Top 10 in several countries and won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song#1991-2000|Academy Award for Best Original Song]];&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/71st-winners.html | title = The 71st Academy Awards (1999) Nominees and Winners | publisher = Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences | date = March 21, 1999 | accessdate =October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Heartbreak Hotel (Whitney Houston song)|Heartbreak Hotel]]" (US No. 2, UK No. 25) featured [[Faith Evans]] and [[Kelly Price]], received a [[1999 MTV Video Music Awards|1999 MTV VMA]] nomination for [[1999 MTV Video Music Awards#Nominations|Best R&amp;B Video]],&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/1999/ | title = 1999 MTV Video Music Awards | publisher = MTV Network | date = September 9, 1999 | accessdate =July 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and number one on the US R&amp;B chart for seven weeks; "[[It's Not Right but It's Okay]]" (US No. 4, UK No. 3) won Houston her sixth [[Grammy Award for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance]];&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=whitney+houston&amp;title=&amp;year=All&amp;genre=All | title = Past Winners Search: Whitney Houston | publisher = National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences | date = February 23, 2000 | accessdate =October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[My Love Is Your Love (song)|My Love Is Your Love]]" (US No. 4, UK No. 2) with 3 million copies sold worldwide;&lt;ref name="mliylsingle01"&gt;{{vcite journal | journal = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fwgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA137 | title = "My Love Is Your Love" single; triple platinum worldwide | page = 137 | volume = 111 | issue = 47 | publisher = Nielsen Business Media, Inc. | date = November 20, 1999 | accessdate =September 25, 2010 | issn = 0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[I Learned from the Best]]" (US No. 27, UK No. 19).&lt;ref name="whitneyhoustonbillboardhistory"&gt;{{vcite web | url = {{BillboardURLbyName|artist=Whitney Houston|chart=all}} | title = Whitney Houston ''Billboard'' chart history |work=Billboard | accessdate =October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whitneyhoustonukcharthistory"&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/whitney%20houston/ | title = Artist Chart History: Whitney Houston | publisher = The Official Charts Company | accessdate = October 29, 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6AcIiV057?url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/WHITNEY%20HOUSTON/ | archivedate = September 12, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These singles became international hits as well, and all the singles, except "When You Believe", became number one hits on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs|''Billboard'' Hot Dance/Club Play]] chart. The album sold four million copies in America, making it certified 4 platinum, and a total of eleven million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The album gave Houston some of her strongest reviews ever. ''Rolling Stone'' said Houston was singing "with a bite in her voice"&lt;ref name="Group1999"&gt;{{vcite book|author=Vibe Media Group|title=Vibe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sigEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA60|date=April 1999|publisher=Vibe Media Group|page=60|issn=1070-4701}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Village Voice'' called it "Whitney's sharpest and most satisfying so far".&lt;ref&gt;Vince Aletti, [http://www.villagevoice.com/1998-12-08/music/look-who-s-ticking/ "Look Who's Ticking"], ''The Village Voice'', December 8, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Houston participated in [[VH1 Divas|VH-1's Divas Live '99]], alongside [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], [[Mary J.

===20002005: ''Just Whitney'' and personal struggles===
Though Houston was seen as a "good girl" with a perfect image in the 1980s and early 1990s, her behavior had changed by the late 1990s. She was often hours late for interviews, photo shoots and rehearsals, and she canceled concerts and talk-show appearances.&lt;ref name="RollingStoneBio"&gt;{{vcite news |title=Whitney Houston biography |work=Rolling Stone |year=2012 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/whitney-houston/biography |accessdate=February 12, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209024845/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/whitneyhouston/biography |archivedate=December 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McShane-20000406"&gt;Larry McShane, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/digest/ent3.htm "Whitney Houston Gets Bad Press"], ''The Washington Post'', April 6, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Missed performances and weight loss led to rumors about Houston using drugs with her husband. On January 11, 2000, airport security guards discovered marijuana in both Houston's and husband Bobby Brown's luggage at a Hawaii airport, but the two boarded the plane and departed before authorities could arrive. Charges were later dropped against them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=TCM Breaking News |url=http://archives.tcm.ie/breakingnews/2001/09/11/story23275.asp |title=Fears for Whitney Houston Grow |date=September 11, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924054858/http://archives.tcm.ie/breakingnews/2001/09/11/story23275.asp |archivedate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rumors of drug usage by Houston and Brown would continue to surface. Two months later, Clive Davis was inducted into the [[Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame]]. Houston had been scheduled to perform at the event, but failed to show up.&lt;ref name="Dansby-20000607"&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Dansby |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/whitneyhouston/articles/story/5924161/whitney_insider_tells_of_drug_use_failed_intervention |title=Whitney Insider Tells of Drug Use, Failed Intervention |work=Rolling Stone |date=June 7, 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527083340/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/whitneyhouston/articles/story/5924161/whitney_insider_tells_of_drug_use_failed_intervention |archivedate=May 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, Houston was scheduled to perform at the Academy Awards, but was fired from the event by musical director and longtime friend [[Burt Bacharach]]. Her publicist cited throat problems as the reason for the cancellation. In his book ''The Big Show: High Times and Dirty Dealings Backstage at the Academy Awards'', author Steve Pond revealed that "Houston's voice was shaky, she seemed distracted and jittery, and her attitude was casual, almost defiant", and that while Houston was supposed to sing "[[Over the Rainbow]]", she would start singing a different song during rehearsals.&lt;ref&gt;Movie &amp; TV News @ IMDb.com, [http://www.imdb.com/news/wenn/2004-12-23#celeb5 "Houston's Oscar Confusion"], December 23, 2004.

In August 2001, Houston signed one of the biggest record deals in music history, with Arista/[[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]. She renewed her contract for $100 million to deliver six new albums, on which she would also earn royalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news |first=Robert |last=Lafranco |last2=Binelli |first2=Mark |last3=Goodman |first3=Fred |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938443/the_rolling_stone_money_report |title=The Rolling Stone Money Report: The pop stars who earned the most last year&amp;nbsp; and how they did it |publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media, LLC]] |date=July 4, 2002 |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BbUDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA18 |title=Whitney Houston Signs $100 Million Contract with Arista Records (p18) |work=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] |date=August 20, 2001 |accessdate=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Billboard |first=Gail |last=Mitchell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQ0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA1|title=Arista Aims New Houston Album At 'Core Urban' Fans |publisher=Nielson Business Media, Inc. |date=December 14, 2002 |accessdate=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later made an appearance on ''[[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special]]'', where her extremely thin frame further spurred rumors of drug use.

In 2002, Houston became involved in a legal dispute with John Houston Enterprise. Although the company was started by her father to manage her career, it was actually run by company president Kevin Skinner. Skinner filed a [[breach-of-contract]] [[lawsuit]] and sued for $100 million (but lost), stating that Houston owed the company previously unpaid compensation for helping to negotiate her $100 million contract with Arista Records and for sorting out legal matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458015/20021008/houston_whitney.jhtml?headlines=true |title=Whitney Houston Sued For $100 Million By Dad's Company |accessdate=January 15, 2008 |publisher=MTV |date=October 8, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houston stated that her 81-year-old father had nothing to do with the lawsuit.

Also in 2002, Houston did an interview with [[Diane Sawyer]] to promote her then-upcoming album. During the prime-time special, Houston spoke about her drug use and her marriage, among other topics. Asked about the ongoing drug rumors, she replied, "First of all, let's get one thing straight. [[Crack cocaine|Crack]] is cheap. I make too much money to ever smoke crack. Let's get that straight. Okay? We don't do crack. We don't do that. Crack is wack."&lt;ref name="Sawyer-Houston-Interview-2002" /&gt; The "crack is wack" line was drawn from a mural that [[Keith Haring]] painted in 1986 on the handball court at 128th Street and Second Avenue in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web|last=Haring|first=Keith|title=Crack is Wack|url=http://www.haring.com/!/art-work/108#.U4zvQeaSys1|publisher = Crack is Wack Mural}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houston did, however, admit to using alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, and pills; she also acknowledged that her mother had urged her to seek help regarding her drug use. Houston also denied having an eating disorder, and denied that her very thin appearance was connected to drug use. Houston further stated that Bobby Brown had never hit her, but acknowledged that she had hit him.&lt;ref name="Sawyer-Houston-Interview-2002" /&gt; 

In December 2002, Houston released her fifth studio album, ''[[Just Whitney]]''. The album included productions from then-husband Bobby Brown, as well as Missy Elliott and Babyface, and marked the first time that Houston did not produce with [[Clive Davis]] as Davis had been released by top management at BMG. Upon its release, ''Just Whitney'' received mixed reviews.&lt;ref&gt;MetaCritic.com, [http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/houstonwhitney/justwhitney "Just Whitney" by Whitney Houston] (last visited February 15, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The album debuted at number 9 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and it had the highest first week sales of any album Houston had ever released.&lt;ref name="Group2003"&gt;{{vcite book|author=Vibe Media Group|title=Vibe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3iYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA186|date=September 2003|publisher=Vibe Media Group|page=186|issn=1070-4701}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four singles released from the album did not fare well on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, but became [[Hot Dance Club Songs|dance chart]] hits. ''Just Whitney'' was certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] in the United States, and sold approximately three million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |title=RIAA Certification Searchable Database |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] |date=January 10, 2003 |accessdate=January 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626050454/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |archivedate=June 26, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a June 2003 trip to [[Israel]], Houston said of her visit, "I've never felt like this in any other country. I feel at home, I feel wonderful."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web|url=http://www.israel21c.org/culture/whitney-houston-calls-israel-home |title=Whitney Houston calls Israel 'home' |publisher=Israel21c.org |date=June 1, 2003 |accessdate=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2003, Houston released her first Christmas album ''[[One Wish: The Holiday Album]]'', with a collection of traditional holiday songs. Houston produced the album with [[Mervyn Warren]] and Gordon Chambers. A single titled "[[One Wish (for Christmas)]]" reached the Top 20 on the Adult Contemporary chart, and the album was certified gold in the US. 

In December 2003, Bobby Brown was charged with battery following a domestic altercation in which he allegedly threatened to beat Houston and then hit her in the face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/12/10/brown.charged/index.html |title=Bobby Brown charged with battery |date=December 10, 2003 |accessdate=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having always been a touring artist, Houston spent most of 2004 touring and performing in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and [[Russia]]. In September 2004, she gave a surprise performance at the [[World Music Awards]] in a tribute to long-time friend [[Clive Davis]]. After the show, Davis and Houston announced plans to go into the studio to work on her new album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Cashmere |url=http://www.mtv.tv/news/Whitney-back-with-Clive-Davis-13112/ |title=Whitney Back With Clive Davis |date=September 17, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709025508/http://www.mtv.tv/news/Whitney-back-with-Clive-Davis-13112/ |archivedate=July 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2004, husband Bobby Brown starred in his own reality TV program, ''[[Being Bobby Brown]]'', on the [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo network]]. The show provided a view of the domestic goings-on in the Brown household. Though it was Brown's vehicle, Houston was a prominent figure throughout the show, receiving as much screen time as Brown. The series aired in 2005 and featured Houston in unflattering moments. ''The Hollywood Reporter'' said that the show was "undoubtedly the most disgusting and execrable series ever to ooze its way onto television".&lt;ref&gt;Barry Garron, [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8409211/ "'Being Bobby Brown' Is Disgusting"], MSNBC, July 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the perceived train-wreck nature of the show, the series gave Bravo its highest ratings in its time slot and continued Houston's successful forays into film and television.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Rogers, [http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/report-bravo-being-bobby-brown-coming-back-for-second-season-3794.php "Report: Bravo's 'Being Bobby Brown' coming back for second season"], RealityTV World, October 31, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The show was not renewed for a second season after Houston stated that she would no longer appear in it, and Brown and Bravo could not come to an agreement for another season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=7&amp;entry_id=12515 "Brown Reality Show Cancelled"], ''SFGate'', The Daily Dish, January 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Houston gave her first interview in seven years in September 2009, appearing on Oprah Winfrey's season premiere. The interview was billed as "the most anticipated music interview of the decade".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/08/20/entertainment/main5255493.shtml "Whitney Houston to Tell All On Oprah"] CBS, August 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Whitney admitted on the show to having used drugs with former husband Bobby Brown during their marriage; Houston said Brown had "laced marijuana with rock cocaine".&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/houston-details-drug-use-we-laced-marijuana-with-rock-cocaine_1116018 |title=Whitney Houston&amp;nbsp; Houston Details Drug Use: 'We Laced Marijuana With Rock Cocaine|publisher=Contact Music |date=September 15, 2009 |accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She told Oprah that before ''[[The Bodyguard (1992 film)|The Bodyguard]]'' her drug use was light, that she used drugs more heavily after the film's success and the birth of her daughter, and that by 1996 "[doing drugs] was an everyday thing...

Evil eyes, staring out like a threat... In another room there was a big framed photo of [Whitney]  but someone had cut [her] head out.

The album entered the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at No. 1, with Houston's best opening week sales of 305,000 copies, marking Houston's first number one album since ''The Bodyguard'', and Houston's first studio album to reach number one since 1987's ''[[Whitney (album)|Whitney]]''. Houston also appeared on European television programs to promote the album. She performed the song "I Look to You" on the German television show ''[[Wetten, dass..?]]''. Three days later, she performed the worldwide first single from ''I Look to You'', "Million Dollar Bill", on the French television show ''[[Le Grand Journal (Canal+)|Le Grand Journal]]''. Houston appeared as guest mentor on ''[[The X Factor (UK series 6)|The X Factor]]'' in the United Kingdom. She performed "Million Dollar Bill" on the following day's results show, completing the song even as a strap in the back of her dress popped open two seconds into the performance. She later commented that she "sang [herself] out of [her] clothes".

In January 2010, Houston was nominated for two NAACP Image Awards, one for Best Female Artist and one for Best Music Video. She won the award for Best Music Video for her single "I Look to You". On January 16, she received [[The BET Honors]] Award for Entertainer citing her lifetime achievements spanning over 25 years in the industry. The 2010 BET Honors award was held at the [[Warner Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Warner Theatre]] in Washington, D.C. and aired on February 1, 2010. [[Jennifer Hudson]] and [[Kim Burrell]] performed in honor of her, garnering positive reviews. Houston also received a nomination from the Echo Awards, Germany's version of the Grammys, for Best International Artist. In April 2010, the UK newspaper ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]'' reported that Houston was thinking about recording her eighth studio album and wanted to collaborate with [[will.i.am]] (of [[The Black Eyed Peas]]), her first choice for a collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a212730/houston-eyes-william-collaboration.html |title=Houston eyes will.i.am collaboration |publisher = Hearst Magazines UK | work = Digital Spy |date=April 6, 2010 |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Houston also performed the song "I Look to You" on the 2011 [[BET]] ''Celebration of Gospel'', with [[Gospel music|gospel]]jazz singer [[Kim Burrell]], held at the Staples Center, Los Angeles. The performance aired on January 30, 2011. Early in 2011, she gave an uneven performance in tribute to cousin Dionne Warwick at music mogul Clive Davis' annual pre-Grammy gala. 

In May 2011, Houston enrolled in a rehabilitation center again, citing drug and alcohol problems. A representative for Houston said that the outpatient treatment was a part of Houston's "longstanding recovery process".&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|url =http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2011/05/whitney-houston-rehab-alcohol-drugs.html|title =Whitney Houston in outpatient rehab for alcohol, drugs|last =D'Zurilla|first =Christie|work=Los Angeles Times |date =May 9, 2011|accessdate =May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced that Houston would produce and star alongside [[Jordin Sparks]] and [[Mike Epps]] in the remake of the 1976 film ''[[Sparkle (1976 film)|Sparkle]]''. In the film, Houston portrays Sparks' "not-so encouraging" mother. Houston is also credited as an executive producer of the film. Debra Martin Chase, producer of ''Sparkle'', stated that Houston deserved the title considering she had been there from the beginning in 2001, when Houston obtained ''Sparkle'' production rights. R&amp;B singer [[Aaliyah]]&amp;nbsp; originally tapped to star as Sparkle&amp;nbsp; died in a 2001 plane crash.

===Reaction===

====Pre-Grammy party====
The Clive Davis's pre-Grammy party that Houston was expected to attend, which featured many of the biggest names in music and movies, went on as scheduled although it was quickly turned into a tribute to Houston. Davis spoke about Houston's death at the evening's start: &lt;blockquote&gt;By now you have all learned of the unspeakably tragic news of our beloved Whitney's passing. I don't have to mask my emotion in front of a room full of so many dear friends. I am personally devastated by the loss of someone who has meant so much to me for so many years. Whitney was so full of life. She was so looking forward to tonight even though she wasn't scheduled to perform. Whitney was a beautiful person and a talent beyond compare. She graced this stage with her regal presence and gave so many memorable performances here over the years. Simply put, Whitney would have wanted the music to go on and her family asked that we carry on.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2012/02/clive-davis-whitney-houston-dead.html|title=Clive Davis: Whitney Houston would have wanted the music to go on|work=Los Angeles Times |date=February 12, 2012|accessdate=February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Tony Bennett]] spoke of Houston's death before performing at Davis's party. He said, "First, it was [[Michael Jackson]], then [[Amy Winehouse]], now, the magnificent Whitney Houston." Bennett sang "[[How Do You Keep the Music Playing?]]" and said of Houston, "When I first heard her, I called Clive Davis and said, 'You finally found the greatest singer I've ever heard in my life.{{' "}}&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2012/02/12/tony-bennett-calls-for-legalization-of-drugs|title=Tony Bennett calls for legalization of drugs|date=February 12, 2012|work=Toronto Sun|accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some celebrities opposed Davis' decision to continue on the party while a police investigation was being conducted in Houston's hotel room and her body was still in the building. [[Chaka Khan]], in an interview with [[CNN]]'s [[Piers Morgan]] on February 13, 2012, shared that she felt the party should have been canceled, saying: "I thought that was complete insanity. And knowing Whitney I don't believe that she would have said 'the show must go on.' She's the kind of woman that would've said 'Stop everything! Un-unh. I'm not going to be there.' [...] I don't know what could motivate a person to have a party in a building where the person whose life he had influenced so enormously and whose life had been affected by hers. They were like... I don't understand how that party went on."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://www.bet.com/news/music/2012/02/14/chaka-khan-clive-davis-should-have-canceled-his-party.html | title = Chaka Khan: Clive Davis Should Have Canceled His Party | first = Brooklyne | last = Gipson | work = BET | publisher = BET Interactive, LLC | date = February 14, 2012 | accessdate = February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sharon Osbourne]] condemned the Davis party, declaring: "I think it was disgraceful that the party went on. I don't want to be in a hotel room when there's someone you admire who's tragically lost their life four floors up. I'm not interested in being in that environment and I think when you grieve someone, you do it privately, you do it with people who understand you. I thought it was so wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a366189/sharon-osbourne-slams-clive-davis-party-after-whitney-houston-death.html | work = [[Digital Spy]] | publisher = Digital Spy Ltd | title = Sharon Osbourne slams Clive Davis party after Whitney Houston death | first = Justin | last = Harp | date = February 16, 2012 | accessdate = February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three featured live interviews with people who had known Houston including those that had worked with her, interviewed her along with some of her peers in the music industry. ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' displayed a photo of a smiling Houston, alongside [[Molly Shannon]], from her 1996 appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web|url=http://idolator.com/6178091/karmin-snl-whitney-houston|title='SNL' Showcases Karmin, Honors Whitney Houston|publisher=Idolator|date=February 12, 2012|accessdate=February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2012/02/12/snl-honors-whitney-houston.html|title='SNL' Honors Whitney Houston|publisher=The Daily Beast|date=February 12, 2012|accessdate=February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; MTV and VH-1 interrupted their regularly scheduled programming on Sunday February 12 to air many of Houston's classic videos with MTV often airing news segments in between and featuring various reactions from fans and celebrities.

Houston's former husband, [[Bobby Brown]], was reported to be "in and out of crying fits" since receiving the news. He did not cancel a scheduled performance and within hours of his ex-wife's sudden death, an audience in Mississippi observed as Brown blew kisses skyward, tearfully saying: "I love you, Whitney."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/506195/bobby-brown-deeply-saddened-asks-for-privacy|title=Bobby Brown Says 'I Love You, Whitney' During Emotional Concert|work=Billboard|date=February 12, 2012|accessdate=February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken Ehrlich, executive producer of the [[54th Grammy Awards]], announced that [[Jennifer Hudson]] would perform a tribute to Houston at the February 12, 2012 ceremony. He said "event organizers believed Hudson&amp;nbsp; an Academy Award-winning actress and Grammy Award-winning artist&amp;nbsp; could perform a respectful musical tribute to Houston." Ehrlich went on to say: "It's too fresh in everyone's memory to do more at this time, but we would be remiss if we didn't recognize Whitney's remarkable contribution to music fans in general, and in particular her close ties with the Grammy telecast and her Grammy wins and nominations over the years."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/02/11/whitney-houston-dies-at-48/|title=Singer Whitney Houston found dead|publisher=FoxNews|date=February 12, 2012|accessdate=February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of the awards ceremony, footage of Houston performing "I Will Always Love You" from the 1994 Grammys was shown following a prayer read by host [[LL Cool J]].

Houston was honored in the form of various tributes at the 43rd NAACP Image Awards, held on February 17. An image montage of Houston and important black figures who died in 2011 was followed by video footage from the 1994 ceremony, which depicted her accepting two Image Awards for outstanding female artist and entertainer of the year.

"Whitney Houston was blessed with an astonishing vocal range and extraordinary technical skill, but what truly made her a great singer was her ability to connect with a song and drive home its drama and emotion with incredible precision", he stated.

Jon Caramanica of ''The New York Times'' commented, "Her voice was clean and strong, with barely any grit, well suited to the songs of love and aspiration.

Lauren Everitt from [[BBC News|BBC News Magazine]] commented on [[melisma]] used in Houston's recording and its influence. "An early 'I' in Whitney Houston's 'I Will Always Love You' takes nearly six seconds to sing. In those seconds the former gospel singer-turned-pop star packs a series of different notes into the single syllable", stated Everitt. "The technique is repeated throughout the song, most pronouncedly on every 'I' and 'you'. The vocal technique is called melisma, and it has inspired a host of imitators. Other artists may have used it before Houston, but it was her rendition of Dolly Parton's love song that pushed the technique into the mainstream in the 90s. [...] But perhaps what Houston nailed best was moderation." Everitt said that "[i]n a climate of reality shows ripe with 'oversinging,' it's easy to appreciate Houston's ability to save melisma for just the right moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17039208 | title = Whitney Houston and the art of melisma | first = Lauren | last = Everitt | publisher = BBC | date = February 15, 2012 | accessdate = February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Houston's vocal stylings have had a significant impact on the music industry. According to Linda Lister in ''Divafication: The Deification of Modern Female Pop Stars'', she has been called the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Queen of Pop]]" for her influence during the 1990s, commercially rivaling Mariah Carey and [[Celine Dion]].&lt;ref name= diva&gt;"If Ella Fitzgerald is the queen of jazz, Billie Holiday first lady of the blues, and Aretha Franklin the queen of soul, then who is the queen of pop?

Certainly all three have their devotees and detractors, but their presence has been inescapable." in {{vcite news | last1= Lister | first1=Linda | title=Divafication: The Deification of Modern Female Pop Stars| newspaper= Popular Music and Society | volume=25|issue=3/4| page=1| year= 2001|issn=0300-7766 | postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

While almost every performer whose albums sell in the millions calls upon an entertainer's bag of tricks, from telling jokes to dancing to circus pyrotechnics, Ms. Houston would rather just stand there and sing." With regard to her singing style, he added: "Her [Houston's] stylistic trademarks&amp;nbsp; shivery melismas that ripple up in the middle of a song, twirling embellishments at the ends of phrases that suggest an almost breathless exhilaration&amp;nbsp; infuse her interpretations with flashes of musical and emotional lightning."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news | author = Holden, Stephen | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/22/arts/review-pop-for-whitney-houston-showy-doesn-t-count-the-show-is-the-voice.html | title = Review/Pop; For Whitney Houston, Showy Doesn't Count: The Show Is the Voice |work=The New York Times | date = July 22, 1993 | accessdate =March 13, 2011 | authorlink = Stephen Holden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elysa Gardner of the ''Los Angeles Times'' in her review for ''The Preacher's Wife Soundtrack'' praised Houston's vocal ability highly, commenting, "She is first and foremost a pop diva&amp;nbsp; at that, the best one we have. No other female pop star&amp;nbsp; not Mariah Carey, not Celine Dion, not [[Barbra Streisand]]&amp;nbsp; quite rivals Houston in her exquisite vocal fluidity and purity of tone, and her ability to infuse a lyric with mesmerizing melodrama."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web | first= Elysa |last=Gardner | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-24/entertainment/ca-2290_1_gospel-choir| title = Oh, Whitney&amp;nbsp; for Heaven's Sake |work=Los Angeles Times | date = November 24, 1996 | accessdate =March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Houston struggled with vocal challenges during her later years. Gary Catona, a voice coach who began working with Houston in 2005, stated: "'When I first started working with her in 2005, she had lost 99.9 percent of her voice... She could barely speak, let alone sing.

===Influence===
During the 1980s, MTV was coming into its own and received criticism for not playing enough videos by black artists. With [[Michael Jackson]] breaking down the color barrier for black men, Houston did the same for black women. She became the first black woman to receive heavy rotation on the network following the success of the "How Will I Know" video.&lt;ref&gt;"Whitney Houston". ''Headliners and Legends''. [[NBC]]. August 8, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Houston's breakthrough, other African-American women, such as [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Anita Baker]], were successful in popular music.&lt;ref name="Rizzo 1987 11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunt 1987 44"/&gt; Baker commented that "Because of what Whitney and [[Sade (singer)|Sade]] did, there was an opening for me... For radio stations, black women singers aren't taboo anymore."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news | first = Dennis |last=Hunt | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-18/entertainment/ca-5281_1_other-black-women | title = Baker And The Rise Of Black Women In Pop | publisher = [[Tribune Company]] |work=Los Angeles Times | date = January 18, 1987 | accessdate =March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[AllMusic]] noted her contribution to the success of black artists on the pop scene, commenting, "Houston was able to handle big adult contemporary ballads, effervescent, stylish dance-pop, and slick urban contemporary soul with equal dexterity" and that "the result was an across-the-board appeal that was matched by scant few artists of her era, and helped her become one of the first black artists to find success on MTV in Michael Jackson's wake".&lt;ref name="allmusicbiography"&gt;{{vcite web | first = Steve |last=Huey | url = http://www.allmusic.com/artist/whitney-houston-p4519/biography | title = Whitney Houston Biography | publisher = [[AllMusic]] | accessdate =October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' stated that "Houston was a major catalyst for a movement within black music that recognized the continuity of soul, pop, jazz and gospel vocal traditions".&lt;ref&gt;Holden, Stephen. "The Pop Life; 1986, A Musically Conservative Year". ''The New York Times''. December 31, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine commented on her initial success breaking various barriers:&lt;blockquote&gt;Of her first album's ten cuts, six were ballads. This chanteuse [Houston] had to fight for air play with hard rockers. The young lady had to stand uncowed in the locker room of macho rock. The soul strutter had to seduce a music audience that anointed few black artists with superstardom. [...] She was a phenomenon waiting to happen, a canny tapping of the listener's yen for a return to the musical middle. And because every new star creates her own genre, her success has helped other blacks, other women, other smooth singers find an avid reception in the pop marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news | author = [[Richard Corliss|Corliss, Richard]], Elizabeth L.

Stephen Holden of ''The New York Times'' said that Houston "revitalized the tradition of strong gospel-oriented pop-soul singing".&lt;ref&gt;Holden, Stephen. [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/16/arts/review-pop-diana-ross-flirts-with-a-willing-audience.html "Review/Pop; Diana Ross Flirts With a Willing Audience"]. ''The New York Times''. June 16, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Ann Powers of the ''Los Angeles Times'' referred to the singer as a "national treasure".&lt;ref name="latimesblogs.latimes.com"/&gt; Jon Caramanica, another music critic of ''The New York Times'', called Houston "R&amp;B's great modernizer", adding "slowly but surely reconciling the ambition and praise of the church with the movements and needs of the body and the glow of the mainstream".&lt;ref name="nytimesjon"/&gt; He also drew comparisons between Houston's influence and other big names' on 1980s pop:&lt;blockquote&gt;She was, alongside Michael Jackson and Madonna, one of the crucial figures to hybridize pop in the 1980s, though her strategy was far less radical than that of her peers. Jackson and Madonna were by turns lascivious and brutish and, crucially, willing to let their production speak more loudly than their voices, an option Ms. Houston never went for. Also, she was less prolific than either of them, achieving most of her renown on the strength of her first three solo albums and one soundtrack, released from 1985 to 1992. If she was less influential than they were in the years since, it was only because her gift was so rare, so impossible to mimic. Jackson and Madonna built worldviews around their voices; Ms. Houstons voice was the worldview. She was someone more to be admired, like a museum piece, than to be emulated.&lt;ref name="nytimesjon"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[The Independent]]''{{'}}s music critic Andy Gill also wrote about Houston's influence on modern R&amp;B and singing competitions, comparing it to Michael Jackson's. "Because Whitney, more than any other single artist  Michael Jackson included  effectively mapped out the course of modern R&amp;B, setting the bar for standards of soul vocalese, and creating the original template for what we now routinely refer to as the 'soul diva' ", stated Gill. "Jackson was a hugely talented icon, certainly, but he will be as well remembered (probably more so) for his presentational skills, his dazzling dance moves, as for his musical innovations. Whitney, on the other hand, just sang, and the ripples from her voice continue to dominate the pop landscape." Gill said that there "are few, if any, Jackson imitators on today's TV talent shows, but every other contestant is a Whitney wannabe, desperately attempting to emulate that wondrous combination of vocal effects&amp;nbsp; the flowing melisma, the soaring mezzo-soprano confidence, the tremulous fluttering that carried the ends of lines into realms of higher yearning".&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/whitney-houston-the-greatest-voice-of-her-generation-6988653.html | title = Whitney Houston, the greatest voice of her generation | work = [[The Independent]] | publisher = Independent Print Ltd.| first = Any | last = Gill | date = February 17, 2012 | accessdate = February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 April 2016, it was announced that Macdonald would work with the film production team [[Altitude Film Distribution|Altitude]], who are behind the award-winning &amp; controversially acclaimed [[Amy Winehouse]] film ''[[Amy (2015 film)|Amy]]'' (2015), on a new [[documentary film]] based on Houston's life and death. This is the first documentary to be officially authorized by the estate that will tell the unvarnished and authentic story of the singers life in a film, including access to never-before-seen footage of Houston, exclusive demo recordings, rare performances and audio archive. Macdonald also will interview those who knew her best, including [[Clive Davis]], founder and president of [[Arista Records]]. Macdonald stated; "The story that is never told about Whitney is just how brilliant she was as an artist; by many measures she had the greatest voice of the last 50 years. She changed the way pop music was sung - bringing it back full circle to its blues and gospel roots. She was also completely unique in being a black pop star who transcended her race globally with her work sold in countries where black artists dont sell."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-36160713|title=Whitney Houston's life to be documented on film|website=BBC|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, entitled ''Whitney'' is set to premiere at the [[2018 Cannes Film Festival]] and is scheduled to released internationally in theatres on July 6, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/films/941774/Whitney-Houston-film-trailer-release-date-Biopic-home-videos-died-drugs&lt;/ref&gt;
