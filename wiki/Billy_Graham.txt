'''William Franklin Graham Jr.''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KBE}} (November 7, 1918&amp;nbsp; February 21, 2018) &lt;!-- DO NOT ADD Billy Graham into here, William Franklin Graham Jr is his birth name --&gt; was an American [[Evangelism|evangelist]], a prominent [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]] figure, &lt;!-- This is not an error. Evangelicalism is a movement within Protestant Christianity. An evangelist is a role, such as pastor, priest or janitor. --&gt; and an ordained [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] minister who became well known internationally in the late 1940s. One of his biographers has placed him "among the most influential Christian leaders" of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=Billy Graham stands among the most influential Christian leaders of the twentieth century.|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/billy-graham-9780190683528?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;#|title=Billy Graham: American Pilgrim|access-date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[preacher]], he held large indoor and outdoor rallies with sermons broadcast on radio and television; some were still being re-broadcast into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Swank jr |first=J.

He also hosted the radio show ''[[Hour of Decision]]'' from 1950 to 1954. He repudiated [[racial segregation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ellis |first=Carl |url=https://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2018/february/advocate-for-all-remembering-billy-graham.html |title=Preaching Redemption Amidst Racism: Remembering Billy Graham |work=[[Christianity Today]] |access-date=March 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his religious aims, he helped shape the worldview of a huge number of people who came from different backgrounds, leading them to find a relationship between the [[Bible]] and contemporary secular viewpoints. According to his website, Graham preached to live audiences of 210 million people in more than 185 countries and territories through various meetings, including [[BMS World Mission]] and [[Global Mission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billygraham.org/mediaRelations/bios.asp?p=1 |title=Media: Bios - William (Billy) F.

Graham was a spiritual adviser to U.S. presidents and provided spiritual counsel for every president from the 33rd, [[Harry S. Truman]], to the 44th, [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://billygraham.org/story/billy-graham-pastor-to-presidents-2/|title=Billy Graham: Pastor to Presidents|work=Billy Graham Evangelistic Association|access-date=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly close to [[Dwight D.

He was also lifelong friends with another televangelist, the founding pastor of the [[Crystal Cathedral]], [[Robert Schuller]], whom Graham talked into starting his own television ministry.&lt;ref name="crystalcathedral archives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crystalcathedral.org/about/rhs.php |title=Dr. Robert H.

Graham operated a variety of media and publishing outlets.&lt;ref name="cincinnati post"&gt;{{cite news |title=Man with a mission |url=http://www2.cincinnati.com/billygraham/p_man.html |first=Barry M. |last=Horstmann |work=Cincinnati Post |date=June 27, 2002 |access-date=August 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his staff, more than 3.2&amp;nbsp;million people have responded to the invitation at Billy Graham Crusades to "accept [[Jesus Christ]] as their [[Salvation#Christianity|personal savior]]".

==Early life==
William Franklin Graham Jr. was born on November 7, 1918, in the downstairs bedroom of a farmhouse near [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=Bruns2004pp5-14&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruns |first=Roger |chapter=A Farm Boy Becomes a Preacher |pages=514 |chapterurl={{Google books|HQvtTF1HSL8C|page=5|plainurl=yes}} |title=Billy Graham: A Biography |publisher=Greenwood Press |series=Greenwood biographies |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-313-32718-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was of Scots-Irish descent and was the eldest of four children born to Morrow (ne Coffey) and William Franklin Graham Sr., a dairy farmer.&lt;ref name=Bruns2004pp5-14 /&gt; Graham was raised on a family dairy farm with his two younger sisters, Catherine Morrow and Jean and a younger brother, Melvin Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Billy Graham's Mother Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/16/obituaries/billy-graham-s-mother-dies.html|publisher=The New York Times Archives|date=August 16, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was eight years old in 1927, the family moved about {{convert|75|yd}} from their white frame house to a newly built red brick home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://billygrahamlibrary.org/video-graham-family-homeplace/ |title=Billy Graham's Childhood Home |publisher=Billygrahamlibrary.org |access-date=October 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised by his parents in the [[Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church]].&lt;ref&gt;James E. Kilgore, ''Billy Graham, The Preacher,'' Exposition Press, 1968{{Page needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David George Mullan, ''Narratives of the Religious Self in Early-Modern Scotland,'' Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2010, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Graham attended the Sharon Grammar School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.us/mothergraham.toc.html#Chapter |title=They Call Me Mother Graham Morrow Coffey Graham |work=ccel.us |access-date=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started to read books from an early age and loved to read novels for boys, especially ''[[Tarzan (book series)|Tarzan]]''. Like Tarzan, he would hang on the trees and gave the popular [[Tarzan yell]], scaring both horses and drivers. According to his father, that yelling had led him to become a minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://billygraham.org/story/billy-graham-trivia-what-did-billy-graham-read-as-a-child/-'Billy-Graham-Trivia-What-Did-Billy-Graham-Read-as-a-Child |title=Billy Graham Trivia What Did Billy Graham Read as a Child| publisher=billygraham.org| date=August 10, 2015|access-date=October 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was fourteen in 1933, [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] ended in December, and Graham's father forced him and his sister, Katherine, to drink beer until they got sick. This created such an aversion that Graham and his sister avoided alcohol and drugs for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref name="time1993"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Nancy |last1=Gibbs |first2=Richard N. |last2=Ostling |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979573,00.html |title=God's Billy Pulpit |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=November 15, 1993 |access-date=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham had been turned down for membership in a local youth group for being "too worldly"&lt;ref name="time1993" /&gt; when Albert McMakin, who worked on the Graham farm, persuaded him to go and see the evangelist [[Mordecai Ham]].&lt;ref name="cincinnati post" /&gt; According to his autobiography, Graham was converted in 1934, at age 16 during a series of revival meetings in Charlotte led by Ham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wheaton.edu/bgc/archives/faq/13.htm |title=Who led Billy Graham to Christ... |publisher=Archives, Billy Graham Center, Wheaton College |access-date=May 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110513224056/http://www.wheaton.edu/bgc/archives/faq/13.htm |archivedate=May 13, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Interview with Reverend Billy Graham|url=http://cmstory.org/billygraham|website=The Charlotte Mecklenburg Story|publisher=Charlotte Mecklenburg Library|access-date=October 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from Sharon High School in May 1936, Graham attended [[Bob Jones University|Bob Jones College]], then located in [[Cleveland, Tennessee]]. After one semester, he found it too legalistic in both coursework and rules.&lt;ref name="time1993" /&gt; At this time he was influenced and inspired by Pastor Charley Young from Eastport Bible Church. He was almost expelled, but [[Bob Jones Sr.]] warned him not to throw his life away: "At best, all you could amount to would be a poor country Baptist preacher somewhere out in the sticks ... You have a voice that pulls. God can use that voice of yours. He can use it mightily."&lt;ref name="time1993" /&gt;

In 1937 Graham transferred to the [[Trinity College (Florida)|Florida Bible Institute]] in [[Temple Terrace, Florida]], near [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]].&lt;ref&gt;The Institute is now [[Trinity College (Florida)|Trinity College of Florida]] in [[New Port Richey, Florida]]&lt;/ref&gt; He preached his first sermon that year at Bostwick Baptist Church near [[Palatka, Florida]], while still a student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirkland|first1=Gary|title=Graham's first-ever sermon?

Reverend Billy Graham Memorial Park was later established on the [[Hillsborough River (Florida)|Hillsborough River]], directly east of the 18th green and across from where Graham often paddled a canoe to a small island in the river, where he would preach to the birds, alligators, and cypress stumps. In 1939, Graham was ordained by a group of Southern Baptist clergymen at Peniel Baptist Church in [[Palatka, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://billygraham.org/about/biographies/billy-graham/ |title=Profile: William (Billy) F. Graham, Jr., Evangelist and Chairman of the Board |website=billygraham.org/ |publisher=Billy Graham Evangelistic Association |location=Charlotte, NC |access-date=October 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, Graham graduated from [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]] in [[Wheaton, Illinois]], with a degree in [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name="Wheaton Alumnus Billy Graham Update"&gt;[https://www.wheaton.edu/news/recent-news/2018/february/wheaton-college-alumnus-billy-graham/ "Wheaton College Alumnus Billy Graham: 1918-2018".] Wheaton.edu. February 21, 2018. Retrieved March 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time at Wheaton, Graham decided to accept the Bible as the [[Biblical infallibility|infallible]] word of God. [[Henrietta Mears]] of the [[First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood]] (Hollywood, California) was instrumental in helping Graham wrestle with the issue. He settled it at Forest Home Christian Camp (now called Forest Home Ministries) southeast of the [[Big Bear Lake, California|Big Bear Lake area]] in [[southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Billy Graham's California Dream |url=http://www.californiality.com/2011/12/billy-grahams-california.html |work=californiality.com |access-date=August 14, 2012}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial there marks the site of Graham's decision.

==Family==
On August 13, 1943, Graham married Wheaton classmate [[Ruth Graham|Ruth Bell]], whose parents were Presbyterian missionaries in China. Her father, [[L. Nelson Bell]], was a general surgeon.&lt;ref name="satevepost"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-4151300.html |title=Billy Graham: the world is his pulpit |work=Saturday Evening Post |author=Stoddard, Maynard Good |date=March 1, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth Graham died on June 14, 2007, at the age of 87.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ruthbellgrahammemorial.org/obituary/|title=Obituary - RUTH BELL GRAHAM|website=ruthbellgrahammemorial.org|access-date=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grahams were married for almost 64 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2018/02/21/billy-graham-billy-and-ruth/359224002/|title=Billy Graham: Billy and Ruth|work=Citizen Times|access-date=February 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham and his wife had five children together: Virginia Leftwich (Gigi) Graham (b. 1945), an inspirational speaker and author; [[Anne Graham Lotz]] (b. 1948), runs AnGeL ministries; Ruth Graham (b. 1950), founder and president of Ruth Graham &amp; Friends, leads conferences throughout the US and Canada; [[Franklin Graham]] (b. 1952), serves as president and CEO of the [[Billy Graham Evangelistic Association]] and as president and CEO of international relief organization, [[Samaritan's Purse]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samaritanspurse.org/ |title=Samaritan's Purse |publisher=Samaritanspurse.org |access-date=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nelson Edman Graham (b. 1958), a pastor who runs East Gates Ministries International,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228052237/http://www.eastgates.org/awordfrombg.html |archivedate=February 28, 2009 |url=http://www.eastgates.org/awordfrombg.html |title=East Gates International |publisher=Eastgates.org |access-date=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which distributes Christian literature in China.

At the time of his death, Graham had 19 grandchildren, including former pastor [[Tullian Tchividjian]], and 41 great-grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World-Renowned TV Evangelist The Rev.

==Ministry career==

While attending college, Graham became pastor of the United Gospel Tabernacle and also had other preaching engagements.

From 1943 to 1944, Graham briefly served as pastor of the First Baptist Church in [[Western Springs, Illinois]], which was not far from Wheaton. While there, his friend Torrey Johnson, pastor of the Midwest Bible Church in Chicago, told Graham that his radio program, ''Songs in the Night'', was about to be canceled due to lack of funding. Consulting with the members of his church in Western Springs, Graham decided to take over Johnson's program with financial support from his congregation. Launching the new radio program on January 2, 1944, still called ''Songs in the Night'', Graham recruited the [[bass-baritone]] [[George Beverly Shea]] as his director of radio ministry. While the radio ministry continued for many years, Graham decided to move on in early 1945.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In 1948 at the age of 29, he became president of [[University of Northwestern  St. Paul|Northwestern Bible College]] in [[Minneapolis]] and the youngest president of a college or university in the country, from which he resigned in 1952.&lt;ref name="ABC 2018 Youngest president"&gt;[http://kstp.com/national/christian-evangelist-rev-billy-graham-dies-age-99/4797356/ AP and Hauser, Tom.

Retrieved March 2, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Graham initially intended to become a [[chaplain]] in the [[United States Armed Forces|Armed Forces]], but he contracted [[mumps]] shortly after applying for a commission. After a period of recuperation in [[Florida]], he was hired as the first full-time [[evangelism|evangelist]] of the new [[Youth for Christ]] (YFC), co-founded by Torrey Johnson and the Canadian evangelist [[Charles Templeton]]. Graham traveled throughout both the United States and Europe as a YFCI evangelist. Templeton applied to [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] for an advanced theological degree and urged Graham to do so as well, but he declined as he was already serving as the president of Northwestern Bible College.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NvTR05fodqYC ''Farewell to God: My Reasons for Rejecting the Christian Faith''].{{Page needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham scheduled a series of [[revival meeting]]s in [[Los Angeles Crusade (1949)|Los Angeles]] in 1949, for which he erected circus tents in a parking lot.&lt;ref name="cincinnati post" /&gt; He attracted national media coverage, especially in the conservative [[William Randolph Hearst|Hearst chain]], although Hearst and Graham never met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/jcs/39.2.273 |jstor=23919865 |title=When Worlds Collide: Politics, Religion, and Media at the 1970 East Tennessee Billy Graham Crusade |journal=Journal of Church and State |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=27395 |year=1997 |last1=King |first1=Randall E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crusade event ran for eight weeks&amp;nbsp; five weeks longer than planned. Graham became a national figure with heavy coverage from the wire services and national magazines.&lt;ref&gt;William Martin, "The Riptide of Revival," ''Christian History and Biography'' (2006), Issue 92, pp. 2429, online&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crusades===
{{main|List of Billy Graham's crusades}}
[[File:Billy Graham - L0055 860Fo30141612210142 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Graham speaking at a Crusade in [[Oslo]], Norway, 1955]]
From the time his ministry began in 1947, Graham conducted more than 400 crusades in 185 countries and territories on six continents. The first Billy Graham Crusade, held September 1321, 1947, in the [[Welsh Auditorium|Civic Auditorium]] in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], was attended by 6,000 people. Graham was 28 years old. He called them crusades, after the medieval Christian forces who conquered Jerusalem.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} He would rent a large venue, such as a stadium, park, or street. As the sessions became larger, he arranged a group of up to 5,000 people to sing in a choir. He would preach the [[gospel]] and invite people to come forward (a practice begun by [[Dwight L. Moody]]). Such people were called inquirers and were given the chance to speak one-on-one with a counselor, to clarify questions and pray together. The inquirers were often given a copy of the [[Gospel of John]] or a [[Bible]] study booklet. In [[Moscow]], in 1992, one-quarter of the 155,000 people in Graham's audience went forward at his call.&lt;ref name="time1993" /&gt; During his crusades, he frequently used the [[altar call]] song, "[[Just As I Am (hymn)#Altar Song in the Billy Graham crusades|Just As I Am]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Usborne |date=June 24, 2005 |title=Billy Graham and the Last Crusade |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/billy-graham-and-the-last-crusade-294716.html |work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham was offered a five-year, $1&amp;nbsp;million contract from [[NBC]] to appear on television opposite [[Arthur Godfrey]], but he had prearranged commitments. He turned down the offer in order to continue his touring revivals.&lt;ref name="satevepost" /&gt; Graham had crusades in [[London]], which lasted 12 weeks, and a [[New York City]] crusade in [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]] in 1957, which ran nightly for 16 weeks.

====Student ministry====
Graham spoke at InterVarsity Christian Fellowship's [[Urbana (conference)|Urbana Student Missions Conference]] at least nine times&amp;nbsp; in 1948, 1957, 1961, 1964, 1976, 1979, 1981, 1984, and 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intervarsity.org/news/billy-graham-intervarsity--new-york-city-1788 |title=Billy Graham, InterVarsity &amp; New York City |publisher=intervarsity.org |date=June 21, 2005 |access-date=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At each Urbana conference, he challenged the thousands of attendees to make a commitment to follow Jesus Christ for the rest of their lives. He often quoted a six-word phrase that was reportedly written in the Bible of [[William Whiting Borden]], the son of a wealthy silver magnate: "No reserves, no retreat, no regrets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://home.snu.edu/~hculbert/regret.htm |title=William Borden: No Reserves. No Retreats. No Regrets |publisher=Home.snu.edu |access-date=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borden had died in Egypt on his way to the mission field.

Graham also held evangelistic meetings on a number of college campuses: at the University of Minnesota during InterVarsity's "Year of Evangelism" in 195051, a 4-day mission at Yale University in 1957, and a week-long series of meetings at the University of North Carolina's Carmichael Auditorium in September 1982.&lt;ref&gt;''For Christ and the University: The Story of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship of the USA&amp;nbsp; 19401990'' by Keith Hunt and Gladys Hunt, InterVarsity Press, 1991.{{Page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 he was invited by students to lead the mission to Cambridge University, arranged by the [[Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union|CICCU]], with the London pastor-theologian [[John Stott]] as his chief assistant. This invitation was greeted with much disapproval in the correspondence columns of ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line. --&gt; |title=Oliver Barclay |url=https://share.trin.cam.ac.uk/sites/public/Alumni/obituaries/Oliver_Barclay.pdf |newspaper=The Times |location=London |publisher=Times Newspapers Limited |date=October 4, 2013 |access-date=December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evangelistic association====
In 1950, Graham founded the [[Billy Graham Evangelistic Association]] (BGEA) with its headquarters in [[Minneapolis]]. The association relocated to [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], in 1999. BGEA ministries have included:
* ''[[Hour of Decision]]'', a weekly radio program broadcast around the world for more than 50 years
* Mission television specials broadcast in almost every market in the US and Canada
* A syndicated newspaper column, ''My Answer'', carried by [[newspaper]]s across the United States and distributed by [[Tribune Media Services]]
* ''Decision'' magazine, the official publication of the association
* ''[[Christianity Today]]'' was started in 1956 with [[Carl F. H. Henry]] as its first editor
* Passageway.org, the website for a youth discipleship program created by BGEA
* [[World Wide Pictures]], which has produced and distributed more than 130 films

In April 2013, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association started "My Hope With Billy Graham", the largest outreach in its history, encouraging church members to spread the gospel in small group meetings after showing a video message by Graham. "The idea is for Christians to follow the example of the disciple [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]] in the New Testament and spread the gospel in their own homes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.al.com/living/index.ssf/2013/04/new_billy_graham_outreach_host.html |title=New Billy Graham outreach: Hosting 'Matthew parties' to share the gospel |publisher=al.com |access-date=August 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video, called "The Cross", is the main program in the My Hope America series and was also broadcast the week of Graham's 95th birthday. In an email interview with [[WorldNetDaily]] (WND), Graham wrote that "we are close to the end of the age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Anderson |first=Troy |title=Billy Graham sounds alarm for 2nd Coming |url=http://www.wnd.com/2013/10/billy-graham-sounds-alarm-for-2nd-coming/ |access-date=October 28, 2013 |newspaper=WND |date=October 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civil rights movement====

Graham's early crusades were [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]], but he began adjusting his approach in the 50s.{{sfn|Schier|2013|pages=4045}} During a 1953 rally in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Graham tore down the ropes that organizers had erected in order to segregate the audience into racial sections. In his memoirs, he recounted that he told two ushers to leave the barriers down "or you can go on and have the revival without me."{{sfn|Miller|2009|pp=1338}} He warned a white audience, "we have been proud and thought we were better than any other race, any other people. Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to stumble into hell because of our pride."{{sfn|Miller|2009|pp=1338}}

In 1957, Graham's stance towards integration became more publicly shown when he allowed black ministers Thomas Kilgore and [[Gardner C. Taylor]] to serve as members of his New York Crusade's executive committee&lt;ref name=grahammlik/&gt; and invited the Rev. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], whom he first met during the [[Montgomery bus boycott]] in 1955,&lt;ref name=grahammlik /&gt; to join him in the pulpit at his 16-week revival in New York City, where 2.3&amp;nbsp;million gathered at [[Madison Square Garden]], [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], and [[Times Square]] to hear them.&lt;ref name="cincinnati post" /&gt; Graham recalled in his autobiography that during this time, he and King developed a close friendship and that he was eventually one of the few people who referred to King as "Mike," a nickname which King asked only his closest friends to call him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billygraham.org/articlepage.asp?articleid=8423 Remembering Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: Gun Fire 45 Years Ago Kills Man that Billy Graham Considered a Friend] Billy Graham.com, April 4, 2013. Retrieved October 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Following King's assassination in 1968, Graham mourned that the US had lost "a social leader and a prophet".&lt;ref name=grahammlik /&gt; In private, Graham advised King and other members of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC).&lt;ref name=upppava /&gt;

Despite their friendship, tensions between Graham and King emerged in 1958 when the sponsoring committee of a crusade which took place in [[San Antonio]], Texas on July 25 arranged for Graham to be introduced by that state's segregationist governor, [[Price Daniel]].&lt;ref name=grahammlik /&gt; On July 23, King sent a letter to Graham and informed him that allowing Daniel to speak at a crusade which occurred the night before the state's Democratic Primary "can well be interpreted as your endorsement of racial segregation and discrimination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/primarydocuments/Vol4/23-July-1958_ToGraham.pdf |title=To Billy Graham |format=PDF |access-date=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham's advisor, Grady Wilson, replied to King that "even though we do not see eye to eye with him on every issue, we still love him in Christ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/primarydocuments/Vol4/28-July-1958_FromWilson.pdf |title=From Grady Wilson |format=PDF |access-date=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Graham's appearance with Daniel dashed King's hopes of holding joint crusades with Graham in the Deep South,&lt;ref name=upppava /&gt; the two still remained friends and King told a Canadian television audience the following year that Graham had taken a "very strong stance against segregation."&lt;ref name=upppava&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WBKaYVni9Z8C&amp;pg=PA92 |title=Billy Graham and the Rise of the Republican South |page=92 |first=Steven P. |last=Miller |year=2009 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-8122-4151-8 |access-date=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham and King would also come to differ on the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=grahammlik /&gt; After King's "[[Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence|Beyond Vietnam]]" speech denouncing US intervention in Vietnam, Graham castigated him and others for their criticism of US foreign policy.&lt;ref name=grahammlik /&gt;

By the middle of 1960, King and Graham traveled together to the Tenth Baptist World Congress of the [[Baptist World Alliance]].&lt;ref name=grahammlik /&gt; In 1963, Graham posted bail for King to be released from jail during the [[Birmingham campaign]], according to Long (2008),{{sfn|Long|2008|pp=150-151}} and the King Center acknowledged that Graham had bailed King out of jail during the [[Albany Movement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/theme/2179|title=The Archive - The Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change|website=www.thekingcenter.org|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; although historian Steven Miller told CNN he could not find any proof of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=CNN |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/22/us/billy-graham-mlk-civil-rights/index.html |title=Where Billy Graham 'missed the mark' |date=February 22, 2018 |accessdate=March 20, 2018 |first=John |last=Blake}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham held integrated crusades in Birmingham, Alabama, on Easter 1964 in the aftermath of the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church]], and toured Alabama again in the wake of the violence that accompanied the first [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma to Montgomery march]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=grahammlik /&gt;

Following his death, former SCLC official and furture Atlanta politician [[Andrew Young]] acknowledged his friendship with Graham and stated that Graham did in fact travel with King to the 1965 European Baptist Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.11alive.com/video/news/billy-graham-passes-away-andrew-young-remembers-the-reverend/85-8015124|title=Billy Graham passes away: Andrew Young remembers the reverend|publisher=|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young also claimed that Graham had often invited King to his crusades in the Northern states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/rev-billy-graham-remembered-as-a-friend-to-the-civil-rights-movement|title=Civil rights leader reflects on Billy Graham's impact on Atlanta, movement|first=|last=FOX|publisher=|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham's faith prompted his maturing view of race and segregation; he told a member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] that integration was necessary primarily for religious reasons: "There is no scriptural basis for segregation," Graham argued. "The ground at the foot of the cross is level, and it touches my heart when I see whites standing shoulder to shoulder with blacks at the cross."&lt;ref name="baptisthistory"&gt;{{cite news |title=Billy Graham: an appreciation |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-87912863.html |publisher=Baptist History and Heritage |date=June 22, 2006 |access-date=August 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lausanne Movement====
The friendship between Graham and John Stott led to a further partnership in the [[Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization|Lausanne Movement]], of which Graham was a founder. It built on Graham's 1966 World Congress on Evangelism in Berlin.{{clarify|date=December 2013}} In collaboration with ''[[Christianity Today]]'', Graham convened what ''TIME'' magazine described as "a formidable forum, possibly the widestranging meeting of Christians ever held"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line. --&gt; |title=Religion: A Challenge from Evangelicals |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879423,00.html |journal=Time (magazine) |date=August 5, 1974 |access-date=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 2,700 participants from 150 nations gathering for the [[First International Congress on World Evangelization|International Congress on World Evangelization]]. This took place in Lausanne, Switzerland (July 1625, 1974), and the movement which ensued took its name from the host city. Its purpose was to strengthen the global church for world evangelization, and to engage ideological and sociological trends which bore on this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Graham, Billy |date=July 16, 1974 |title=Why Lausanne? |medium=Audio recording |location=Lausanne, Switzerland |publisher=Billy Graham Center Archives |url=http://www2.wheaton.edu/bgc/archives/docs/Lausanne/704/graham.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham invited Stott to be chief architect of the [[Lausanne Covenant]], which issued from the Congress and which, according to Graham, "helped challenge and unite evangelical Christians in the great task of world evangelization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stott |first=John |year=1997 |title=Making Christ known: historic mission documents from the Lausanne Movement, 19741989 |chapter=Foreword by Billy Graham |location=US |publisher=Wm.

==Multiple roles==
[[File:Billy Graham.JPG|thumb|Graham with his son, Franklin, at [[Cleveland Stadium]], June 1994]]
Graham played multiple roles that reinforced each other. Grant Wacker identifies eight major roles he played: preacher, icon, Southerner, entrepreneur, architect (or bridge builder), pilgrim, pastor and finally his widely recognized status as America's Protestant patriarch, on a par with Martin Luther King and Pope John Paul II.&lt;ref&gt;Grant Wacker. ''America's Pastor: Billy Graham and the Shaping of a Nation'' Look for the purposes 2014) p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham as bridge builder deliberately reached into the secular world. For example, as entrepreneur he built his own pavilion for the [[1964 New York World's Fair]].&lt;ref name=IN70&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/news/2005/5th_dimension/chapters/credits.htm |title="Man in the 5th Dimension," In 70&amp;nbsp;mm News / The 70&amp;nbsp;mm Newsletter |publisher=In70mm.com |date=March 6, 2005 |access-date=May 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525223201/http://www.in70mm.com/news/2005/5th_dimension/chapters/credits.htm |archivedate=May 25, 2011 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared as a guest on a 1969 [[Woody Allen]] television special, where he joined the comedian in a witty exchange on theological matters.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xS9f-DI5ag4C&amp;pg=PA52 |title=Love, Sex, Death &amp; The Meaning of Life: The Films of Woody Allen |first=Foster |last=Hirsch |publisher=Da Capo Press |page=52 |year=2001 |isbn=0-306-81017-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the [[Cold War]], Graham-the-bridge-builder became the first evangelist of note to speak behind the [[Iron Curtain]], addressing large crowds in countries throughout Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union, calling for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, Michael and Gibbs, Nancy.

Retrieved 2007-24-11.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]] era, Graham consistently refused to visit [[South Africa]] until its government allowed integrated seating for audiences. During his first crusade there in 1973, he openly denounced [[apartheid]].{{sfn|Aikman|2007|pages=10910}} Graham also corresponded with imprisoned South African leader [[Nelson Mandela]] during the latter's 27-year imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crossmap.christianpost.com/news/billy-graham-nelson-mandela-united-by-apartheid-opposition-7290] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211081713/http://crossmap.christianpost.com/news/billy-graham-nelson-mandela-united-by-apartheid-opposition-7290|date=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Billy Graham in het Feyenoord stadion.ogg|thumb|Billy Graham at the Feyenoord-stadion in Rotterdam, The Netherlands (June 30, 1955)]]
In 1984, he led a series of meetings in the United Kingdom summer, called Mission England, using outdoor [[Association football|football]] (soccer) grounds as venues.

Graham was interested in fostering evangelism around the world. In 1983, 1986 and 2000 he sponsored, organized and paid for massive training conferences for Christian evangelists from around the world; with the largest representations of nations ever held until that time. Over 157 nations were gathered in 2000 at the [[Amsterdam RAI Exhibition and Convention Centre|RAI Convention Center]] in [[Amsterdam]], the Netherlands. At one revival in [[Seoul]], South Korea, Graham attracted more than one million people to a single service.&lt;ref name="satevepost" /&gt; He appeared in [[China]] in 1988&amp;nbsp; for Ruth, this was a homecoming, since she had been born in China to missionary parents. He appeared in [[North Korea]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="baptisthistory" /&gt;

On October 15, 1989, Graham received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Graham was the only minister, functioning in that capacity, to receive one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-10-16/local/me-93_1_evangelist-billy-graham |title=Billy Graham Now a Hollywood Star |work=Los Angeles Times |date=October 16, 1989 |access-date=November 25, 2012 |first=Sheryl |last=Stolberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 22, 1991, Graham held his largest event in North America on [[Great Lawn and Turtle Pond, Central Park|the Great Lawn]] of New York's [[Central Park]]. City officials estimated more than 250,000 in attendance. In 1998, Graham spoke at [[TED (conference)]] to a crowd of scientists and philosophers.

On September 14, 2001, only three days after the [[September 11 attacks|World Trade Center attacks]], Graham was invited to lead a service at [[Washington National Cathedral]], which was attended by President [[George W. Bush]] and past and present leaders. He also spoke at the memorial service following the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="baptisthistory" /&gt; On June 2426, 2005, Billy Graham began what he has said would be his last North American crusade, three days at the [[Flushing MeadowsCorona Park]] in New York City. But on the weekend of March 1112, 2006, Billy Graham held the "Festival of Hope" with his son, [[Franklin Graham]]. The [[festival]] was held in [[New Orleans]], which was recovering from [[Hurricane Katrina]].

Graham prepared one last sermon, ''My Hope America'', released on DVD and played around America and possibly worldwide between November 710, 2013, November 7 being his 95th birthday, hoping to cause a revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://myhopewithbillygraham.org/what-is-my-hope/? |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822005233/http://myhopewithbillygraham.org/what-is-my-hope/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 22, 2012 |title=My Hope With Billy Graham Mission Statement |publisher=My Hope America Website |access-date=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life, death, and memorial==
[[File:Billy Graham's memorial service.jpg|thumb|right| President [[Donald Trump]] and First Lady [[Melania Trump]] honor the late Reverend Billy Graham on February 28, 2018.]]
Graham said that his planned [[retirement]] was because of his failing health; he had suffered from [[hydrocephalus]] from 1992 on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.journalnow.com/news/state_region/billy-graham-has-brain-shunt-adjusted/article_b1919452-0c66-560d-8e15-a283bfe48a7a.html|title=Billy Graham has brain shunt adjusted|last=Staff|first=JournalNow|work=Winston-Salem Journal|access-date=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2005, Graham appeared at the groundbreaking for his library in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].

On July 9, 2006, he spoke at the [[Metro Maryland Youth For Christ|Metro Maryland Franklin Graham Festival]], held in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, at [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]].

In April 2010, Graham, at 91 and with substantial vision, hearing and balance loss, made a rare public appearance at the re-dedication of the renovated [[Billy Graham Library]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Funk, [http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/04/21/92603/lion-in-winter-billy-graham-hearing.html "Lion in Winter: Billy Graham, Hearing and Sight Failing, Pays a Visit"], ''Charlotte Observer'', April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

There had been controversy over Graham's proposed burial place; he announced in June 2007 that he and his wife would be buried alongside each other at the Billy Graham Library in his hometown of Charlotte. Graham's younger son Ned had argued with older son Franklin about whether burial at a library would be appropriate. Ruth Graham had said that she wanted to be buried not in Charlotte but in the mountains at the Billy Graham Training Center at The Cove near [[Asheville, North Carolina]], where she had lived for many years; Ned supported his mother's choice.&lt;ref name="washpostburial"&gt;{{cite news |title=A Family at Cross-Purposes |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/12/AR2006121201338.html |work=The Washington Post |date=December 13, 2006 |access-date=August 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hearld"&gt;{{cite news |title=Graham's wife in coma, close to death; both will be buried at library. |url=http://www.heraldonline.com/news/local/article12181541.html |work=The Herald |date=June 14, 2007 |access-date=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novelist [[Patricia Cornwell]], a family friend, also opposed burial at the library, calling it a tourist attraction.

At the ceremony, Senate Majority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]] and Speaker of the House [[Paul Ryan]] called Graham "America's pastor".

==Politics==
After his close relationships with [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and [[Richard Nixon]], Graham tried to avoid explicit partisanship. Bailey says:
:He declined to sign or endorse political statements, and he distanced himself from the Christian right&amp;nbsp;... His early years of fierce opposition to communism gave way to pleas for military disarmament and attention to AIDS, poverty and environmental threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sarah Pulliam |last=Bailey |title=How Donald Trump is bringing Billy Graham's complicated family back into White House circles |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/01/12/how-donald-trump-is-bringing-billy-grahams-complicated-family-back-into-white-house-circles/ |work=Washington Post |date=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham was a registered member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name="nbcinterv2005"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rev. Billy Graham on his lasting legacy |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8326362/ |publisher=Today Show |date=June 23, 2005 |access-date=September 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960 he was opposed to the candidacy of [[John F. Kennedy]], fearing that because Kennedy was a Catholic, he would be bound to follow the Pope. Graham worked "behind the scenes" to encourage influential Protestant ministers to speak out against him.&lt;ref name="GIA" /&gt; Graham met with a conference of Protestant ministers in [[Montreux]], [[Switzerland]], during the 1960 campaign, to discuss their mobilizing congregations to defeat Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/godinamerica/transcripts/hour-five.html |title=God in America: 'The Soul of a Nation' |publisher=PBS |quote=Billy Graham convenes a meeting of American Protestant ministers in Montreux, Switzerland, for the purpose of discussing how they could ensure that John Kennedy would not be elected in November |date=October 11, 2010 |access-date=October 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[PBS]] ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' program, ''God in America'' (2010), Episode 5, Graham also organized a meeting in September 1960 of hundreds of Protestant ministers in Washington, D.C. to this purpose; [[Norman Vincent Peale]] led the meeting.&lt;ref name="GIA"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/godinamerica/study-guide/five.html Study Guide: ''God in America'', Episode 5, "The Soul of America"] PBS Frontline, October 2010, program available online&lt;/ref&gt; This was shortly before Kennedy's speech on the separation of church and state in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], which was considered to be successful in meeting concerns of many voters. After his election, however, Kennedy invited Graham to play golf in [[Palm Beach, Florida]], after which Graham acknowledged Kennedy's election as an opportunity for Catholics and Protestants to come closer together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Funk|first1=Tim|title=The Presidents' preacher: From Truman to Trump|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/special-reports/billy-graham-life/article201279814.html|access-date=February 22, 2018|work=Charlotte Observer|date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mize&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mize|first1=Douglas W.|title=John F.

Kennedy|Kennedy's assassination]], and to have tried to contact him to say, "Don't go to Texas!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crosbie|first1=Robert C.|title=Billy Graham's Warning to JFK|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-c-crosby-dmin/billy-grahams-warning-to-_b_4289423.html|access-date=February 22, 2018|work=HuffPost|date=November 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham leaned toward the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] during the presidency of Richard Nixon, whom he had met and befriended as Vice President under [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].&lt;ref name="worldscollide"&gt;{{cite journal |title=When worlds collide: politics, religion, and media at the 1970 East Tennessee Billy Graham Crusade |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19592304.html |first=Randall E. |last=King |journal=Journal of Church and State |date=March 22, 1997 |access-date=August 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not completely ally himself with the later [[Christian right|religious right]], saying that Jesus did not have a political party.&lt;ref name="time1993" /&gt; He gave his support to various political candidates over the years.&lt;ref name="worldscollide" /&gt;

In 2007, Graham explained his refusal to join [[Jerry Falwell]]'s [[Moral Majority]] in 1979, saying: "I'm for morality, but morality goes beyond sex to human freedom and social justice. We as clergy know so very little to speak with authority on the [[Panama Canal]] or superiority of armaments. Evangelists cannot be closely identified with any particular party or person. We have to stand in the middle in order to preach to all people, right and left. I haven't been faithful to my own advice in the past. I will be in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Merritt |date=February 21, 2018 |title=Billy Graham, the Last Nonpartisan Evangelical? |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/opinion/billy-graham-nonpartisan-evangelical.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2006 ''[[Newsweek]]'' interview, "For Graham, politics is a secondary to the Gospel&amp;nbsp;... When ''Newsweek'' asked Graham whether ministers&amp;nbsp; whether they think of themselves as evangelists, pastors or a bit of both&amp;nbsp; should spend time engaged with politics, he replied: 'You know, I think in a way that has to be up to the individual as he feels led of the Lord. A lot of things that I commented on years ago would not have been of the Lord, I'm sure, but I think you have some&amp;nbsp; like communism, or segregation, on which I think you have a responsibility to speak out.'"&lt;ref name="newsweek2006p4"&gt;{{cite news |title=Pilgrim's Progress| page= 4 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/46365/page/4 |work=Newsweek |date=August 14, 2006 |access-date=September 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Graham publicly endorsed the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate, [[Mitt Romney]].&lt;ref name="wapo101112"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/10/11/billy-graham-to-mitt-romney-ill-do-all-i-can-to-help-you/?wprss=rss_election-2012 |title=Billy Graham to Mitt Romney: 'I'll do all I can to help you' |work=The Washington Post |date=October 11, 2012 |access-date=October 11, 2012 |author=O'Keefe, Ed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, apparently in order to accommodate Romney, who is a [[Mormonism|Mormon]], references to Mormonism as a religious cult ("A cult is any group which teaches doctrines or beliefs that deviate from the biblical message of the Christian faith.") were removed from Graham's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/16/billy-grahams-group-removes-mormon-cult-reference-from-website-after-romney-meeting/comment-page-14/ |title=Billy Graham site removes Mormon 'cult' reference after Romney meeting |publisher=CNN |date=October 16, 2012 |access-date=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/16/billy-graham-website-mormon-cult-removed_n_1971669.html |title=Billy Graham Website Removes Mormon 'Cult' Reference After Romney Meeting |work=HuffPost |date=October 16, 2012 |access-date=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observers have questioned whether the support of Republican and religious right politics on issues such as [[same-sex marriage]] coming from Graham&amp;nbsp; who stopped speaking in public or to reporters&amp;nbsp; in fact reflects the views of his son, [[Franklin Graham|Franklin]], head of the BGEA. Franklin denied this, and said that he would continue to act as his father's spokesperson rather than allowing press conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.journalnow.com/news/local/billy-graham-speaks-with-his-own-voice-son-franklin-says/article_a7bf875e-c2c4-5bd4-8dd8-6182ed451bfd.html |work=McClatchy News Service |date=October 24, 2012 |title=Billy Graham speaks with his own voice, son Franklin says |first=Michael |last=Gordon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pastor to presidents===
[[File:Reagans with Billy Graham.jpg|thumb|President [[Ronald Reagan]] and first lady [[Nancy Reagan]] greet Graham at the [[National Prayer Breakfast]] of 1981]]
Graham had a personal audience with many sitting [[president of the United States|US presidents]], from [[Harry S. Truman]] to [[Barack Obama]]&amp;nbsp; 12 consecutive presidents. After meeting with Truman in 1950, Graham told the press he had urged the president to counter [[communism]] in [[North Korea]]. Truman disliked him and did not speak with him for years after that meeting.&lt;ref name="time1993" /&gt; Later he always treated his conversations with presidents as confidential.&lt;ref name="worldscollide" /&gt;

Truman was not fond of Graham. He wrote about Graham in his 1974 autobiography ''Plain Speaking'', "But now we've got just this one evangelist, this Billy Graham, and he's gone off the beam. He's...well, I hadn't ought to say this, but he's one of those counterfeits I was telling you about. He claims he's a friend of all the Presidents, but he was never a friend of mine when I was President. I just don't go for people like that. All he's interested in is getting his name in the paper."&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Merle (1974) Plain Speaking: An Oral Biography of Harry S. Truman. New York: Putnam. p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Billy Graham (1966) by Erling Mandelmann.jpg|thumb|Graham in 1966]]
Graham became a regular visitor during the tenure of Dwight D. Eisenhower. He purportedly urged him to intervene with federal troops in the case of the [[Little Rock Nine]] to gain admission of black students to public schools.&lt;ref name="time1993" /&gt; House Speaker [[Sam Rayburn]] convinced Congress to allow Graham to conduct the first [[Worship|religious service]] on the steps of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol building]] in 1952.&lt;ref name="time1993" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charles Atlas with a Halo |url=http://www.religion-online.org/blog/article/charles-atlas-with-a-halo-americas-billy-graham/ |author=Wacker, Grant |date=April 1, 1992 |pages=33641 |work=The Christian Century}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenhower asked for Graham while on his [[death]]bed.&lt;ref name="washpost1991"&gt;{{cite news |title=The President Preacher; In Crisis, White House Turns to Billy Graham |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1044879.html |work=The Washington Post |date=January 18, 1991 |access-date=August 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham met and would become a close friend of Vice President Richard Nixon,&lt;ref name="worldscollide" /&gt;{{sfn|Aikman|2010|pp=204205}} and supported Nixon, a [[Quakers|Quaker]], for the [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 presidential election]].&lt;ref name="time1993" /&gt; He convened an August strategy session of evangelical leaders in Montreaux, Switzerland, to plan how best to oppose Nixon's [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] opponent, Senator [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Larry Ingle, ''Nixon's First Cover-up: The Religious Life of a Quaker President''. pp. 10104, University of Missouri Press, 2015, {{ISBN|978-0-8262-2042-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though a registered Democrat, Graham also maintained firm support of aggression against the foreign threat of Communism and strongly sympathized with Nixon's views regarding American foreign policy.&lt;ref name=Aikman2010pp203-210 /&gt; Thus, he was more sympathetic to Republican administrations.&lt;ref name="worldscollide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="martinbiopost"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Essence of Billy Graham; A Warm but Honest Biography of the Evangelist |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1091805.html |work=The Washington Post |date=October 25, 1991 |access-date=August 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 16, 1963, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, who was impressed by the way Graham had praised the work of his great-grandfather Rev. [[George Washington Baines]], invited Graham to the White House to give him spiritual counseling. After this visit, Johnson frequently would call on Graham for more spiritual counselling as well as companionship. As Graham recalled to his biographer Frady, "I almost used the White House as a hotel when Johnson was President. He was always trying to keep me there. He just never wanted me to leave."&lt;ref name=Aikman2010pp195-203&gt;{{cite book |first1=David |last1=Aikman |authorlink1=David Aikman |chapter=Lyndon B. Johnson |chapterurl={{Google books|IbufdthAJx4C|page=195|plainurl=yes}} |pages=195203 |year=2010 |title=Billy Graham: His Life and Influence |isbn=978-1-4185-8432-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In striking contrast with his more limited access with Truman, Eisenhower and Kennedy, Graham would not only visit the White House private quarters but would also at times kneel at Johnson's bedside and then pray with him whenever the President requested him to do so. Graham once recalled "I have never had many people do that."&lt;ref name=Aikman2010pp195-203 /&gt; In addition to his White House visits, Graham would visit Johnson at [[Camp David]] and occasionally met with the President when he retreated to his private ranch in [[Stonewall, Texas]]. Johnson would also become the first sitting President to attend one of Graham's crusades, which took place in Houston, Texas, in 1965.&lt;ref name=Aikman2010pp195-203 /&gt;

During the 1964 United States presidential election, supporters of Republican nominee [[Barry Goldwater]] sent an estimated 2 million telegrams to Graham's hometown of [[Montreat, North Carolina]], and sought the preacher's endorsement. Supportive of Johnson's domestic policies, and hoping to preserve his friendship with the President, Graham resisted pressure to endorse Goldwater and stayed neutral in the election. Following Johnson's election victory, Graham's role as the main White House pastor was solidified. At one point, Johnson even considered making Graham a member of his cabinet and grooming him to be his successor, though Graham insisted he had no political ambitions and wished to remain a preacher.&lt;ref name=Aikman2010pp195-203 /&gt; Graham's biographer David Aikman acknowledged that the preacher was closer to Johnson than any other President he had ever known.&lt;ref name=Aikman2010pp203-210 /&gt;

He spent the last night of Johnson's presidency in the White House, and he stayed for the first night of Nixon's.&lt;ref name="washpost1991" /&gt; After Nixon's victorious [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 presidential campaign]], Graham became an adviser, regularly visiting the White House and leading the president's private worship services.&lt;ref name="worldscollide" /&gt; In a meeting they had with [[Golda Meir]], Nixon offered Graham the ambassadorship to [[Israel]], but he refused.&lt;ref name="time1993" /&gt;

[[File:Barack Obama and Billy Graham.jpg|thumb|Billy Graham meeting with President [[Barack Obama]] in [[Montreat, North Carolina|Montreat]], April 2010]]

In 1970, Nixon appeared at a Graham revival in [[East Tennessee]], which they thought safe politically. It drew one of the largest crowds in Tennessee and protesters against the [[Vietnam War]]. Nixon was the first president to give a speech from an evangelist's platform.&lt;ref name="worldscollide" /&gt; Their friendship became strained in 1973 when Graham rebuked Nixon for his post-[[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] behavior and the profanity heard on the [[Nixon White House tapes|Watergate tapes]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} They eventually reconciled after Nixon's resignation.&lt;ref name="worldscollide" /&gt;

Graham officiated at one presidential burial and one presidential funeral. He presided over the graveside services of President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1973 and took part in eulogizing the former president. Graham officiated at the funeral services of former First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] in 1993,&lt;ref name="time1993" /&gt; and the [[death and state funeral of Richard Nixon]] in 1994.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} During the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Graham asserted that he believed President Bill Clinton to be "a spiritual person."{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} He was unable to attend the state funeral of [[Ronald Reagan]] on June 11, 2004, as he was recovering from hip replacement surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://christianity.about.com/od/glossary/p/billygraham.htm |title=Biography of Evangelist Billy Graham |publisher=Christianity.about.com |access-date=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was mentioned by [[George W. Bush]] in his eulogy.

On April 25, 2010, President [[Barack Obama]] visited Graham at his home in Montreat, North Carolina, where they "had a private prayer."&lt;ref name="nytimes2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=Obama Visits the Rev.

===Relationship with Queen Elizabeth II===
Graham had a friendly relationship with [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and was frequently invited by the Royal Family to special events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://billygraham.org/story/billy-graham-and-the-queen/|title=Billy Graham Reflects on His Friendship with Queen Elizabeth II|work=Billy Graham Evangelistic Association|access-date=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://people.com/royals/queen-elizabeth-real-life-friendship-evangelist-billy-graham/|title=The Crown: The Truth Behind Queen Elizabeth's Real-Life Friendship with Evangelist Billy Graham|work=People|access-date=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They first met in 1955 and Graham preached at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|Windsor Chapel]] at the Queen's invitation during the following year. Their friendly relationship may have been because they shared a traditional approach to the practical aspects of the Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/billy-graham-dead-queen-elizabeth-ii-friendship-us-evangelical-preacher-the-crown-visit-a8221816.html|title=Billy Graham dead: Truth behind Queen Elizabeth II's friendship with the US evangelical preacher|work=The Independent|access-date=January 25, 2018|first=Clarisse |last=Loughrey |date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy views===
Graham was outspoken against [[communism]] and supported the American [[Cold War]] policy, including the [[Vietnam War]]. In a 1999 speech, Graham discussed his relationship with the late [[North Korea]]n leader [[Kim Il-sung]], praising him as a "different kind of communist" and "one of the great fighters for freedom in his country against the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]]." Graham went on to note that although he had never met Kim's son and former North Korean [[Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea|leader]] [[Kim Jong-il]], he had "exchanged gifts with him."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2553945.ece Preacher power: America's God squad] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817195823/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2553945.ece |date=August 17, 2007}} Independent Article, ''Preacher power: America's God squad'', July 25, 2007;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Graham preached in the [[Soviet Union]] and attended a wreath-laying ceremony to honor the war dead of [[World War II]], when the Soviets were American allies in the fight against [[Nazism]]. He voiced fear of a second holocaust, not against [[Jews]], but "a nuclear holocaust" and advised that "our greatest contribution to world peace is to live with Christ every day."&lt;ref&gt;"Dr. Billy Graham trying to avoid offending Soviets", [[United Press International]] story in ''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', May 10, 1982, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversial views==
===Discussion of Jews with President Nixon===
During the Watergate affair, there were suggestions that Graham had agreed with many of President [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] opinions, but he denied them and stressed his efforts to build bridges to the Jewish community. In 2002, the controversy was renewed when declassified "[[Nixon White House tapes|Richard Nixon tapes]]" confirmed remarks made by Graham to Nixon three decades earlier.&lt;ref name="nytimes03172002"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/17/us/billy-graham-responds-to-lingering-anger-over-1972-remarks-on-jews.html Billy Graham Responds to Lingering Anger Over 1972 Remarks on Jews], ''The New York Times'', March 17, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Captured on the tapes, Graham agreed with Nixon that [[Antisemitic canard#Accusations of controlling the media|Jews control]] the [[Media of the United States|American media]], calling it a "stranglehold" during a 1972 conversation with Nixon, and suggesting that if Nixon was [[United States presidential election, 1972|re-elected]], they might be able to do something about it.&lt;ref name="bbcregret"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1850077.stm "Graham regrets Jewish slur"], [[BBC]], March 2, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, more Nixon tapes were released, in which Graham is heard in a 1973 conversation with Nixon referring to Jews and "the synagogue of [[Satan]]". A spokesman for Graham said that Graham has never been an antisemite and that the comparison (in accord with the context of the quotation in the [[Book of Revelation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+3:9&amp;version=NIV|title=Revelation 3:9|work=Bible Gateway}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was directed specifically at those claiming to be Jews, but not holding to traditional Jewish values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628074206/http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-06-24-graham-tapes_N.htm|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-06-24-graham-tapes_N.htm |title=In Nixon tapes, Billy Graham refers to 'synagogue of Satan' |first=Cathy Lynn |last=Grossman |work=[[USA Today]] |access-date=July 31, 2009 |date=June 24, 2009 |archivedate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecumenism===
After a 1957 crusade in New York, some more fundamentalist Protestant Christians criticized Graham for his [[ecumenism]], even calling him "Antichrist".&lt;ref name="Wirt"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Sherwood Eliot |last=Wirt |title=Billy: A Personal Look at Billy Graham, the World's Best-loved Evangelist |publisher=Crossway Books |location=Wheaton, Illinois |year=1997 |page=97 |isbn=0-89107-934-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham expressed [[Inclusivism|inclusivist]] views, suggesting that people without explicit faith in Jesus can be saved. In a 1997 interview with [[Robert Schuller]], Graham said
{{Quote|I think that everybody that loves or knows Christ, whether they are conscious of it or not, they are members of the body of Christ&amp;nbsp;... [God] is calling people out of the world for his name, whether they come from the Muslim world, or the Buddhist world or the non-believing world, they are members of the Body of Christ because they have been called by God. They may not know the name of Jesus but they know in their hearts that they need something they do not have, and they turn to the only light they have, and I think that they are saved and they are going to be with us in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Iain Murray (author)|Iain Murray]], ''Evangelicalism Divided'' (2000), pp. 7374.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Iain Murray (author)|Iain Murray]], writing from a conservative Protestant standpoint, argues that "Graham's concessions are sad words from one who once spoke on the basis of biblical certainties."&lt;ref&gt;[[Iain Murray (author)|Iain Murray]], ''Evangelicalism Divided'' (2000), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on women===
In 1970, Graham stated that feminism was "an echo of our overall philosophy of permissiveness" and that women did not want to be "competitive juggernauts pitted against male chauvinists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Jesus and the Liberated Woman |first1=Billy |last1=Graham |journal=[[Ladies' Home Journal]] |date=December 1970 |volume=87 |pages=404}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Billy Graham Enters Women's Lib Controversy |date=November 28, 1970 |newspaper=The Kokomo Tribune |page=7 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/44885500/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further stated that the role of wife, mother, and homemaker was the destiny of "real womanhood" according to the Judeo-Christian ethic; Graham's assertions, published in the ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]'', elicited letters of protest, and were offered as rebuttal to the establishment of "The New Feminism" section of the publication added following sit-in protest at the Journal offices demanding female representation on the staff of the publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.feminist.org/research/chronicles/fc1970.html |title=Feminist Chronicles - 1970 |publisher=Feminist Majority Foundation |access-date=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Watching Women's Liberation, 1970: Feminism's Pivotal Year on the Network News |page=112 |url={{Google books|tmtzAwAAQBAJ|page=112|plainurl=yes}} |first1=Bonnie J. |last1=Dow |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-252-09648-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://libcom.org/history/1970-feminist-sit-ladies-home-journal |title=1970: Feminist Sit in at Ladies Home Journal |first=ShaKea |last=Alston |date=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ellen Ott |last1=Marshall |chapter=A Matter of Pride, A Feminist Response |pages=7991 |chapterurl={{Google books|pVAeaDLnCJoC|page=79|plainurl=yes}} |editor1-first=Michael G. |editor1-last=Long |year=2008 |title=The Legacy of Billy Graham: Critical Reflections on America's Greatest Evangelist |isbn=978-0-664-23656-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham was well known for his practice of not spending time alone with any woman other than his wife. This has become known as the [[Billy Graham rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Justin|title=Where Did the 'Billy Graham Rule' Come From?|url=https://blogs.thegospelcoalition.org/evangelical-history/2017/03/30/where-did-the-billy-graham-rule-come-from/|publisher=[[The Gospel Coalition]]|access-date=April 2, 2017|date=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billy's daughter Bunny recounts her father denying her and her sisters higher education. As reported in ''[[The Washington Post]]'':&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/02/21/divorce-drugs-drinking-billy-grahams-children-and-their-absent-father/ |title=Divorce, drugs, drinking: Billy Graham's children and their absent father |first=William |last=Martin |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=February 21, 2018 |access-date=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Bunny remembers being groomed for the life of wife, homemaker, and mother. "There was never an idea of a career for us," she said. "I wanted to go to nursing school&amp;nbsp; Wheaton had a five-year program&amp;nbsp; but Daddy said no. No reason, no explanation, just 'No.' It wasn't confrontational and he wasn't angry, but when he decided, that was the end of it." She added, "He has forgotten that. Mother has not."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Billy talked his future wife, Ruth, into abandoning her ambition to evangelize in Tibet in favor of staying in the United States to marry him  and that to do otherwise would be "to thwart God's obvious will."&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; After Ruth agreed to marry Billy, he cited the Bible for claiming authority over her, saying, "then I'll do the leading and you do the following."&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;

===Views on homosexuality===
Graham regarded [[homosexuality]] as a sin, and in 1974 described it as "a sinister form of perversion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanders|first1=Linley|title=Internet Reacts to Obama Tweet About Billy Graham|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/internet-reacts-to-obama-tweet-about-billy-graham|access-date=March 2, 2018|work=[[Teen Vogue]]|date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=Tim|title=The complicated legacy of Billy Graham: Gospel or politics?|url=http://www.nola.com/opinions/index.ssf/2018/02/billy_graham_gospel_politics.html|access-date=March 2, 2018|work=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 he said that he thought AIDS might be a "judgment" from God, but two weeks later he retracted the remark, saying, "I don't believe that, and I don't know why I said it."&lt;ref name=Gjelten&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gjelten|first1=Tom|title='America's Pastor' Billy Graham Dies At 99|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/02/21/136224476/americas-pastor-billy-graham-dies-at-99|access-date=March 2, 2018|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BBC News, February 21, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2012, he took out full-page ads in favor of [[North Carolina Amendment 1]], which banned it in North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Kilgore, [http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/02/billy-graham-lived-at-the-crossroads-of-faith-and-power.html ''Billy Graham Lived at the Crossroads of Faith and Power''], ''New York'', February 21, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsingazette.com/news/billy-graham-urges-anti-gay-vote-in-n-c/article_d63fec14-f8b6-5e3d-89b5-272ab4f5517b.html ''Billy Graham urges anti-gay vote in N.C.'']. Wisconsin Gazette, May 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham's stated position was that he did not want to talk about homosexuality as a political issue.&lt;ref name=Gjelten /&gt; Corky Siemaszko, writing for [[NBC News]], noted that after the 1993 incident, Graham "largely steered clear of the subject."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siemaszko|first1=Corky|title=Franklin Graham followed in his father Billy's footsteps, but took a right-leaning path|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/franklin-graham-followed-his-father-billy-s-footsteps-took-right-n849981|access-date=March 2, 2018|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, however, some commentators called Graham "[[homophobic]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robertson|first1=Douglas|title=The outpouring of grief for evangelist Billy Graham is disturbing given his homophobic views|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/billy-graham-dead-evangelist-homophobic-barack-obama-justin-welby-a8223561.html|access-date=March 2, 2018|work=[[The Independent]]|date=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
