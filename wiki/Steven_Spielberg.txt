As a child, Spielberg faced difficulty reconciling being an Orthodox Jew with the perception of him by other children he played with. "It isn't something I enjoy admitting," he once said, "but when I was seven, eight, nine years old, God forgive me, I was embarrassed because we were Orthodox Jews. I was embarrassed by the outward perception of my parents' Jewish practices. I was never really ashamed to be Jewish, but I was uneasy at times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Slovie|last=Jungreis-Wolff|title=Steven Spielberg, E.T. and Growing Up Jewish|url=http://www.aish.com/f/p/Steven-Spielberg-ET-and-Growing-Up-Jewish.html|work=The Jewish Website - aish.com|date=August 22, 2015|accessdate=May 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Steven Spielberg: 'We Can't Just Sit Back and Hope'|publisher=Parade Magazine|date=March 27, 1994|url=http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/1994/edition_03-27-1994/steven-spielberg-we-cant-just-sit-back-and-hope.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202024010/https://parade.com/articles/editions/1994/edition_03-27-1994/steven-spielberg-we-cant-just-sit-back-and-hope.html|archivedate=February 2, 2016|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg also said he suffered from acts of [[anti-Semitic]] prejudice and bullying: "In high school, I got smacked and kicked around.

In 1958, he became a [[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scout]] and fulfilled a requirement for the [[Merit badge (Boy Scouts of America)|photography merit badge]] by making a nine-minute 8&amp;nbsp;mm film entitled ''The Last Gunfight''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Steven Spielberg Sighted in Arizona|url = http://doney.net/aroundaz/celebrity/spielberg_stephen.htm| accessdate =November 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Spielberg recalled to a magazine interviewer, "My dad's still-camera was broken, so I asked the scoutmaster if I could tell a story with my father's movie camera. He said yes, and I got an idea to do a Western. I made it and got my merit badge. That was how it all started."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nickelodeon Magazine Interviews Steven Spielberg|work=[[Nickelodeon Magazine]]|url=http://www.nick.com/shows/nick_mag/lookInside/index.jhtml?pagenum=8|accessdate=July 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At age 13, while living in Phoenix, Spielberg won a prize for a 40-minute war film he titled ''Escape to Nowhere'' using a cast composed of other high school friends. That motivated him to make 15 more amateur 8&amp;nbsp;mm films.&lt;ref name=Fischer /&gt;{{rp|548}} In 1963, at age 16, Spielberg wrote and directed his first independent film, a 140-minute science fiction adventure called ''[[Firelight (1964 film)|Firelight]]'', which would later inspire ''Close Encounters''. The film was made for $500, most of which came from his father, and was shown in a local cinema for one evening, which earned back its cost.&lt;ref&gt;From Inside the Actor's Studio with James Lipton interviewing Steven Spielberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

After attending [[Arcadia High School (Phoenix, Arizona)|Arcadia High School]] in Phoenix for three years, his family next moved to [[Saratoga, California]], where he later graduated from [[Saratoga High School (California)|Saratoga High School]] in 1965. He attained the rank of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]]. His parents divorced while he was still in school,&lt;ref name="weisman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weisman|first1=Aly|title=Meet Steven Spielberg's Parents In This Revealing '60 Minutes' Profile|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/meet-steven-spielbergs-parents-in-this-revealing-60-minutes-profile-2012-10|accessdate=September 29, 2016|publisher=Business Insider|date=October 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon after he graduated Spielberg moved to [[Los Angeles]], staying initially with his father. His long-term goal was to become a film director. His three sisters and mother remained in Saratoga. In Los Angeles, he applied to the [[University of Southern California]]'s film school, but was turned down because of his "C" grade average.&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;Fischer, Dennis. ''Science Fiction Film Directors, 18951998'', McFarland &amp; Co. (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|548}} He then applied and was admitted to [[California State University, Long Beach]], where he became a brother of [[Theta Chi Fraternity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetachi.org/about/notable-theta-chis/ "Notable Theta Chis"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418075922/http://www.thetachi.org/about/notable-theta-chis/|date=April 18, 2015 }}, Theta Chi Fraternity alumni&lt;/ref&gt;

While still a student, he was offered a small unpaid intern job at [[Universal Studios]] with the editing department.&lt;ref name=USCtrustee&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/about/administration/trustees/|title=Board of Trustees  About USC|work=usc.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726020808/http://www.usc.edu/about/administration/trustees/|archivedate=July 26, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calstate.edu/Newsline/Archive/01-02/020514-LB.shtml|title=CSU Newsline  Steven Spielberg To Graduate from California State University, Long Beach With Bachelor's Degree in Film and Electronic Arts|publisher=Calstate.edu|date=May 14, 2002|accessdate=March 2, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309122336/https://www.calstate.edu/Newsline/Archive/01-02/020514-LB.shtml|archivedate=March 9, 2010|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later given the opportunity to make a short film for theatrical release, the 26-minute, 35&amp;nbsp;mm, ''[[Amblin']]'', which he wrote and directed. Studio vice president [[Sidney Sheinberg]] was impressed by the film, which had won a number of awards, and offered Spielberg a seven-year directing contract. It made him the youngest director ever to be signed for a long-term deal with a major Hollywood studio.&lt;ref name=Fischer /&gt;{{rp|548}} He subsequently dropped out of college to begin professionally directing TV productions with Universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url =http://articles.latimes.com/2002/may/31/local/me-graduate31|title= Spielberg to Add B.A. to His Resume|author= Stephanie Chavez|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date =May 31, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2014/06/26/first-glimpses-spielberg-and-snow-white/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0|title=1969: Spielberg and Snow White|author=Mark Bulik|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date = June 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg later returned to [[California State University, Long Beach]] and completed his BA degree in Film and Electronic Arts in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3579578/Spielberg-why-I-went-back-to-college.html|title=Spielberg: why I went back to college|first=John|last=Hiscock|date=June 30, 2002|accessdate=December 1, 2017|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1970s===
His first professional TV job came when he was hired to direct one of the segments for the 1969 pilot episode of ''[[Night Gallery (film)|Night Gallery]]'', written by [[Rod Serling]] and starring [[Joan Crawford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url =http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064725/|title= Night Gallery|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate = July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford, however, was "speechless, and then horrified" at the thought of a twenty-one-year-old newcomer directing her, one of Hollywood's leading stars. "Why was this happening to me?" she asked the producer.&lt;ref name=Chandler&gt;Chandler, Charlotte. ''Not the Girl Next Door: Joan Crawford, a Personal Biography'', Hal Leonard Corp. (2008) p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; Her attitude changed after they began working on her scenes:

{{cquote|When I began to work with Steven, I understood everything. It was immediately obvious to me, and probably everyone else, that here was a young genius. I thought maybe more experience was important, but then I thought of all of those experienced directors who didn't have Steven's intuitive inspiration and who just kept repeating the same old routine performances. ''That'' was called "experience." I knew then that Steven Spielberg had a brilliant future ahead of him. Hollywood doesn't always recognize talent, but Steven's was not going to be overlooked. I told him so in a note I wrote him. I wrote to Rod Serling, too. I was so grateful that he had approved Steven as the director. I told him he had been totally right.&lt;ref name=Chandler /&gt;}}

She and Spielberg were reportedly close friends until her death. The episode is unusual in his body of work, in that the camerawork is more highly stylized than his later, more "mature" films. After this, and an episode of ''[[Marcus Welby, M.D.]]'', Spielberg got his first feature-length assignment: an episode of ''[[The Name of the Game (TV series)|The Name of the Game]]'' called "[[L.A. 2017]]". This futuristic science fiction episode impressed Universal Studios and they signed him to a short contract. He did another segment on ''Night Gallery'' and did some work for shows such as ''[[Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law]]'' and ''The Psychiatrist'', before landing the first series episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'' (previous episodes were actually TV films).

Based on the strength of his work, Universal signed Spielberg to do four TV films. The first was a [[Richard Matheson]] adaptation called ''[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]''. The film is about a psychotic [[Peterbilt 281]] [[tanker truck]] driver who chases the terrified driver ([[Dennis Weaver]]) of a small [[Plymouth Valiant]] and tries to run him off the road. Special praise of this film by the influential British critic [[Dilys Powell]] was highly significant to Spielberg's career. Another TV film (''[[Something Evil]]'') was made and released to capitalize on the popularity of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', then a major best-selling book which had not yet been released as a film. He fulfilled his contract by directing the TV film-length pilot of a show called ''Savage'', starring [[Martin Landau]]. Spielberg's debut full-length feature film was ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'', about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain custody of their baby. Spielberg's cinematography for the police chase was praised by reviewers, and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated that "a major new director is on the horizon."&lt;ref name=McBride /&gt;{{rp|223}} However, the film fared poorly at the box office and received a limited release.

Studio producers [[Richard D. Zanuck]] and [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]] offered Spielberg the director's chair for ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', a thriller-horror film based on the [[Peter Benchley]] novel [[Jaws (novel)|about an enormous killer shark]]. Spielberg has often referred to the gruelling shoot as his professional crucible. Despite the film's ultimate, enormous success, it was nearly shut down due to delays and budget over-runs. But Spielberg persevered and finished the film. It was an enormous hit, winning three Academy Awards (for editing, original score and sound) and grossing more than $470&amp;nbsp;million worldwide at the box office. It also set the domestic record for box office gross, leading to what the press described as "Jawsmania."&lt;ref name=McBride /&gt;{{rp|248}} ''Jaws'' made Spielberg a household name and one of America's youngest multi-millionaires, allowing him a great deal of autonomy for his future projects.&lt;ref name=McBride /&gt;{{rp|250}} It was nominated for Best Picture and featured Spielberg's first of three collaborations with actor [[Richard Dreyfuss]].

Rejecting offers to direct ''[[Jaws 2]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=John|year=1997|title=Steven Spielberg: The Unauthorised Biography|location=London|publisher=Harper Collins|page=145|isbn=0-00-638444-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]'' and ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', Spielberg and actor Richard Dreyfuss re-convened to work on a film about [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]], which became ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977). One of the rare films both written and directed by Spielberg, ''Close Encounters'' was a critical and box office hit, giving Spielberg his first Best Director nomination from the Academy as well as earning six other [[Academy Awards]] nominations. It won Oscars in two categories (Cinematography, [[Vilmos Zsigmond]], and a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing, Frank E. Warner). This second blockbuster helped to secure Spielberg's rise. His next film, ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'', a big-budgeted World War&amp;nbsp;II farce, was not nearly as successful and though it grossed over $92.4&amp;nbsp;million worldwide (and did make a small profit for co-producing studios Columbia and Universal) it was seen as a disappointment, mainly with the critics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1979/01941.php "1941, Box Office Information."] ''The Numbers'', September 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spielberg then revisited his ''Close Encounters'' project and, with financial backing from Columbia Pictures, released ''Close Encounters: The Special Edition'' in 1980. For this, Spielberg fixed some of the flaws he thought impeded the original 1977 version of the film and also, at the behest of Columbia, and as a condition of Spielberg revising the film, shot additional footage showing the audience the interior of the mothership seen at the end of the film (a decision Spielberg would later regret as he felt the interior of the mothership should have remained a mystery). Nevertheless, the re-release was a moderate success, while the 2001 DVD release of the film restored the original ending.

===1980s===
Next, Spielberg teamed with ''[[Star Wars]]'' creator and friend [[George Lucas]] on an action adventure film, ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', the first of the [[Indiana Jones]] films. The archaeologist and adventurer hero Indiana Jones was played by [[Harrison Ford]] (whom Lucas had previously cast in his ''[[Star Wars]]'' films as [[Han Solo]]). The film was considered an homage to the cliffhanger serials of the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]]. It became the biggest film at the box office in 1981, and the recipient of numerous Oscar nominations including Best Director (Spielberg's second nomination) and Best Picture (the second Spielberg film to be nominated for Best Picture). ''Raiders'' is still considered a landmark example of the action-adventure genre. The film also led to Ford's casting in [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Blade Runner]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blade Runner|url=http://www.gradesaver.com/blade-runner/wikipedia/casting-and-characters/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820185400/https://www.gradesaver.com/blade-runner/wikipedia/casting-and-characters/|archivedate=August 20, 2011|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, Spielberg returned to the science fiction genre with ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''. It was the story of a young boy and the alien he befriends, who was accidentally left behind by his companions and is attempting to return home. ''E.T.'' went on to become the top-grossing film of all time. It was also nominated for nine Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director and it won 4 out of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/21/et-spielberg-fantasy|title=ET: The Extra-Terrestrial: No 7 best sci-fi and fantasy film of all time|last=Wise|first=Damon|date=October 21, 2010|work=The Guardian|access-date=October 18, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Between 1982 and 1985, Spielberg produced three high-grossing films: ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'' (for which he also co-wrote the screenplay), a big-screen adaptation of ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie|The Twilight Zone]]'' (for which he directed the segment "Kick The Can"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1556111/story.jhtml|title= Rewind: Major-Studio flicks that belong in the Grind House|first = Karl|last = Heitmueller|date = April 3, 2007|accessdate =January 2, 2009|publisher = MTV|quote = Ultimate A-lister Steven Spielberg co-produced this big-budget adaptation of Rod Serling's classic '60s TV show....}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Goonies]]'' (Spielberg, executive producer, also wrote the story on which the screenplay was based).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = This way to the children's crusade|first = Richard|last = Corliss|date = January 7, 1985|accessdate =January 2, 2009|quote = he wrote the story and served as an executive producer of The Goonies....|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959559,00.html|journal = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg appeared in a cameo on [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s music video for the movie's theme song, "[[The Goonies 'R' Good Enough]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|LxLhytQ67fs|Cyndi Lauper  The Goonies 'R' Good Enough}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Steven Spielberg with Chandran Rutnam in Sri Lanka.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Steven Spielberg and [[Chandran Rutnam]] on a location in Sri Lanka during the filming of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]''.]]
His next directorial feature was the ''Raiders'' prequel ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]''. Teaming up once again with Lucas and Ford, the film was plagued with uncertainty for the material and script. This film and the Spielberg-produced ''[[Gremlins]]'' led to the creation of the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG-13 rating]] due to the high level of violence in films targeted at younger audiences. In spite of this, ''Temple of Doom'' is rated PG by the MPAA, even though it is the darkest and, possibly, most violent Indy film. Nonetheless, the film was still a huge blockbuster hit in 1984. It was on this project that Spielberg also met his future wife, actress [[Kate Capshaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Steven-Spielberg-9490621|title=Steven Spielberg Biography|publisher=Biography.com|date=December 18, 1947|accessdate=January 31, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514201106/https://www.biography.com/articles/Steven-Spielberg-9490621|archivedate=May 14, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Spielberg released ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]],'' an adaptation of [[Alice Walker]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[The Color Purple|novel of the same name]], about a generation of empowered African-American women during depression-era America. Starring [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and future talk-show superstar [[Oprah Winfrey]], the film was a box office smash and critics hailed Spielberg's successful foray into the dramatic genre. [[Roger Ebert]] proclaimed it the best film of the year and later entered it into his Great Films archive. The film received eleven [[Academy Award]] nominations, including two for Goldberg and Winfrey. However, Spielberg did not get a Best Director nomination.

In 1987, as China began opening to Western capital investment, Spielberg shot the first American film in Shanghai since the 1930s, an adaptation of [[J. G. Ballard]]'s autobiographical novel ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', starring [[John Malkovich]] and a young [[Christian Bale]]. The film garnered much praise from critics and was nominated for several Oscars, but did not yield substantial box office revenues. Reviewer [[Andrew Sarris]] called it the best film of the year and later included it among the best films of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Andrew Sarris' Top 10 lists 19582005| url = http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/sarris.html#y1977| accessdate =October 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg was also a co-producer of the 1987 film ''[[Batteries Not Included|*batteries not included]]''.

After two forays into more serious dramatic films, Spielberg then directed the third Indiana Jones film, 1989's ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''. Once again teaming up with Lucas and Ford, Spielberg also cast actor [[Sean Connery]] in a supporting role as Indy's father. The film earned generally positive reviews and was another box office success, becoming the highest-grossing film worldwide that year; its total box office receipts even topped those of Tim Burton's much-anticipated film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', which had been the bigger hit domestically. Also in 1989, he re-united with actor [[Richard Dreyfuss]] for the romantic comedy-drama ''[[Always (1989 film)|Always]]'', about a daredevil pilot who extinguishes forest fires. Spielberg's first romantic film, ''Always'' was only a moderate success and had mixed reviews.

===1990s===
[[File:Spielberg1990.jpg|thumb|left|Spielberg in March 1990]]
In 1991, Spielberg directed ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'', about a middle-aged [[Peter Pan]], played by [[Robin Williams]], who returns to [[Neverland]]. Despite innumerable rewrites and creative changes coupled with mixed reviews, the film proved popular with audiences, making over $300&amp;nbsp;million worldwide (from a $70&amp;nbsp;million budget).

In 1993, Spielberg returned to the adventure genre with the film version of [[Michael Crichton]]'s novel ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', about a theme park with genetically engineered dinosaurs. With revolutionary special effects provided by friend [[George Lucas]]'s [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] company, the film would eventually become the highest-grossing film of all time (at the worldwide box office) with $914.7&amp;nbsp;million. This would be the third time that one of Spielberg's films became the highest-grossing film ever.

Spielberg's next film, ''[[Schindler's List]]'', was based on the true story of [[Oskar Schindler]], a man who risked his life to save 1,100 Jews from the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;The screenplay, adapted from [[Thomas Keneally]]'s novel, was originally in the hands of fellow director [[Martin Scorsese]], but Spielberg negotiated with Scorsese to trade scripts. (At the time, Spielberg held the script for a remake of ''[[Cape Fear (1962 film)|Cape Fear]]''.)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Schindler's List'' earned Spielberg his first [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (it also won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]). With the film a huge success at the box office, Spielberg used the profits to set up the [[Shoah Foundation]], a non-profit organization that archives filmed testimony of Holocaust survivors. In 1997, the [[American Film Institute]] listed it among the 10 Greatest American Films ever Made (#9) which moved up to (#8) when the list was remade in 2007.

In 1994, Spielberg took a hiatus from directing to spend more time with his family and build his new studio, [[DreamWorks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Army Archered|title = Spielberg to take break after completing 'List'|publisher = Variety|date = June 17, 1993|url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862199.html?categoryid=2&amp;cs=1&amp;query=dark+AND+angel|accessdate =February 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; with partners [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] and [[David Geffen]]. In 1996, he directed the sequel to 1993's ''Jurassic Park'' with ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'', which generated over $618&amp;nbsp;million worldwide despite mixed reviews, and was the second biggest film of 1997 behind [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (which topped the original ''Jurassic Park'' to become the new recordholder for box office receipts).
[[File:Steven Spielberg - GianAngelo Pistoia 1.jpg|thumb|right|Spielberg in 1993]]

His next film, ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'', was based on a true story (like ''Schindler's List''), specifically about an African slave rebellion. Despite decent reviews from critics, it did not do well at the box office. Spielberg released ''Amistad'' under DreamWorks Pictures,&lt;ref&gt;(formed with former [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animation exec [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] and media mogul [[David Geffen]], providing the other letters in the company name)&lt;/ref&gt; which has produced all of his films from ''Amistad'' onwards with the exception of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (film)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'' and ''[[Ready Player One (film)|Ready Player One]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Masters|first1=Kim|title=Steven Spielberg on DreamWorks' Past, Amblin's Present and His Own Future|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/steven-spielberg-dreamworks-past-amblins-902544|accessdate=July 11, 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His 1998 theatrical release was the World War II film ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', about a group of U.S. soldiers led by Capt. Miller ([[Tom Hanks]]) sent to bring home a [[paratrooper]] whose three older brothers were killed in the same twenty-four hours, June 56, of the Normandy landing. The film was a huge box office success, grossing over $481&amp;nbsp;million worldwide and was the biggest film of the year at the North American box office (worldwide it made second place after Michael Bay's ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]''). Spielberg won his second Academy Award for his direction. The film's graphic, realistic depiction of combat violence influenced later war films such as ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'' and ''[[Enemy at the Gates]]''. The film was also the first major hit for DreamWorks, which co-produced the film with [[Paramount Pictures]] (as such, it was Spielberg's first release from the latter that was not part of the ''Indiana Jones'' series). Later, Spielberg and [[Tom Hanks]] produced a [[Band of Brothers (TV miniseries)|TV mini-series]] based on [[Stephen Ambrose]]'s book ''[[Band of Brothers (book)|Band of Brothers]]''. The ten-part [[HBO]] mini-series follows Easy Company of the [[101st Airborne Division]]'s 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment. The series won a number of awards at the [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]] and the [[Emmy Award|Emmys]].

===2000s===
In 2001, Spielberg filmed fellow director and friend [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s final project, ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'' which Kubrick was unable to begin during his lifetime. A futuristic film about a humanoid [[android (robot)|android]] longing for love, ''A.I.'' featured groundbreaking visual effects and a multi-layered, allegorical storyline, adapted by Spielberg himself. Though the film's reception in the US was relatively muted, it performed better overseas for a worldwide total box office gross of $236&amp;nbsp;million.

Spielberg and actor [[Tom Cruise]] collaborated for the first time for the futuristic [[neo-noir]] ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', based upon [[The Minority Report|the science fiction short story]] written by [[Philip K. Dick]] about a Washington D.C. police captain in the year 2054 who has been foreseen to murder a man he has not yet met. The film received strong reviews with the review tallying website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] giving it a 92% approval rating, reporting that 206 out of the 225 reviews they tallied were positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/minority_report/|title=Minority Report|last=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film earned over $358&amp;nbsp;million worldwide. [[Roger Ebert]], who named it the best film of 2002, praised its breathtaking vision of the future as well as for the way Spielberg blended [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] with live-action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020621/REVIEWS/206210304/1023|title=Minority Report|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=June 21, 2002|work=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=April 10, 2018|authorlink=Roger Ebert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spielberg's 2002 film ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' is about the daring adventures of a youthful con artist (played by [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]). It earned [[Christopher Walken]] an Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. The film is known for [[John Williams]]' score and its unique [[title sequence]]. It was a hit both commercially&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=catchmeifyoucan.htm| title=Box office collection of Catch Me If You Can| accessdate=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and critically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/catch_me_if_you_can/|title=Reviews of Catch Me If You Can|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spielberg collaborated again with Tom Hanks along with [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] and [[Stanley Tucci]] in 2004's ''[[The Terminal]]'', a warm-hearted comedy about a man of Eastern European descent who is stranded in an airport. It received mixed reviews but performed relatively well at the box office. In 2005, ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine ranked Spielberg number one on a list of the greatest film directors of all time.

Also in 2005, Spielberg directed a modern adaptation of ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'' (a co-production of Paramount and DreamWorks), based on the H. G. Wells book of the same name (Spielberg had been a huge fan of the book and the original 1953 film). It starred Tom Cruise and [[Dakota Fanning]], and, as with past Spielberg films, [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] (ILM) provided the [[visual effects]]. Unlike ''E.T.'' and ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'', which depicted friendly alien visitors, ''War of the Worlds'' featured violent invaders. The film was another huge box office smash, grossing over $591&amp;nbsp;million worldwide.

Spielberg's film ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'', about the events following the 1972 [[Munich Massacre]] of Israeli athletes at the Olympic Games, was his second film essaying Jewish relations in the world (the first being ''Schindler's List''). The film is based on ''[[Vengeance (Jonas book)|Vengeance]]'', a book by Canadian journalist [[George Jonas]]. It was previously adapted into the 1986 made-for-TV film ''[[Sword of Gideon]]''. The film received strong critical praise, but underperformed at the U.S. and world box-office; it remains one of Spielberg's most controversial films to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Yossi Melman and Steven Hartov|first=|date=January 17, 2006|title=Munich: Fact and Fantasy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,3604,1687815,00.html|journal=|publisher=The Guardian Unlimited|volume=|pages=|accessdate=April 10, 2018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Munich'' received five Academy Awards nominations, including Best Picture, Film Editing, Original Music Score (by John Williams), Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Director for Spielberg.

[[File:Steven Spielberg Masterclass Cinmathque Franaise 2 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Spielberg at his masterclass at the [[Cinmathque Franaise]] in January 2012.]]
In early 2009, Spielberg shot the first film in a planned trilogy of [[motion capture]] films based on ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', written by Belgian artist [[Herg]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/23/books/23book.html "The Man Behind Boy, Dog and Their Adventures"] Book review by [[Charles McGrath]], ''The New York Times'', December 22, 2009 (December 23, 2009, p.

===Production credits===
Since the mid-1980s, Spielberg has increased his role as a film producer. He headed up the production team for several cartoons, including the Warner Bros. hits ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'', ''[[Toonsylvania]]'', and ''[[Freakazoid!]]'', for which he collaborated with [[Jean MacCurdy]] and [[Tom Ruegger]]. Due to his work on these series, in the official titles, most of them say, "Steven Spielberg presents" as well as making numerous cameos on the shows. Spielberg also produced the [[Don Bluth]] animated features, ''[[An American Tail]]'' and ''[[The Land Before Time]]'', which were released by [[Universal Studios]]. He also served as one of the executive producers of ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' and its three related shorts (''Tummy Trouble'', ''Roller Coaster Rabbit'', ''Trail Mix-Up''), which were all released by Disney, under both the [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and the [[Touchstone Pictures]] banners.

Spielberg appears, as himself, in the game to direct the player. The Spielberg name provided branding for a [[Lego]] Moviemaker kit, the proceeds of which went to the Starbright Foundation.

== Themes ==
{{Original research|section|date=April 2011}}
Spielberg's films often deal with several recurring themes. Most of his films deal with ordinary characters searching for or coming in contact with extraordinary beings or finding themselves in extraordinary circumstances. &lt;!-- This is especially evident in the [[Indiana Jones]] series. : Archaeologist, adventurer and relic hunter is not really an "ordinary character"--&gt;In an [[American Film Institute|AFI]] interview in August 2000 Spielberg commented on his interest in the possibility of extraterrestrial life and how it has influenced some of his films. Spielberg described himself as feeling like an alien during childhood,&lt;ref name="McBride"&gt;{{cite book| last = McBride| first = Joseph| title = Steven Spielberg| publisher = Faber and Faber|year=1997| isbn = 0-571-19177-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his interest came from his father, a science fiction fan, and his opinion that aliens would not travel light years for conquest, but instead curiosity and sharing of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = E.T. DVD Production Notes Booklet| publisher = Universal|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A strong consistent [[theme (literature)|theme]] in his family-friendly work is a childlike sense of wonder and faith, as attested by works such as ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'', ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'' and ''[[The BFG (2016 film)|The BFG]]''. According to Warren Buckland,&lt;ref&gt;Directed by Steven Spielberg: Poetics of the Contemporary Hollywood Blockbuster&lt;/ref&gt; these themes are portrayed through the use of low height camera tracking shots, which have become one of Spielberg's directing trademarks. In the cases when his films include children (''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'', ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', etc.), this type of shot is more apparent, but it is also used in films like ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'', ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', ''[[The Terminal]]'', ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', and ''[[Amistad (1997 film)|Amistad]]''. Each of his films feature this shot utilized by the director, and the water scenes in ''Jaws'' are filmed from the low-angle perspective of someone swimming. Another child oriented theme in Spielberg's films is that of loss of innocence and coming-of-age. In ''Empire of the Sun'', Jim, a well-groomed and spoiled English youth, loses his innocence as he suffers through World War II China. Similarly, in ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', Frank naively and foolishly believes that he can reclaim his shattered family if he accumulates enough money to support them.

The most persistent theme throughout his films is tension in parent-child relationships. Parents (often fathers) are reluctant, absent or ignorant. Peter Banning in ''Hook'' starts off in the beginning of the film as a reluctant married-to-his-work parent who through the course of the film regains the respect of his children. The absence of Elliott's father in ''E.T.'' is the most famous example of this theme. In ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', it is revealed that Indy has always had a very strained relationship with his father, who is a professor of medieval literature, as his father always seemed more interested in his work, specifically in his studies of the Holy Grail, than in his own son, although his father does not seem to realize or understand the negative effect that his aloof nature had on Indy (he even believes he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son "self reliance," which is not how Indy saw it). Even [[Oskar Schindler]], from ''[[Schindler's List]]'', is reluctant to have a child with his wife. In ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'', the main character, Celie, has been impregnated by her father multiple times. ''[[Munich]]'' depicts Avner as a man away from his wife and newborn daughter. There are exceptions; Brody in ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' is a committed family man, while John Anderton in ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' is a shattered man after the disappearance of his son. This theme is arguably the most autobiographical aspect of Spielberg's films, since Spielberg himself was affected by his parents' divorce as a child and by the absence of his father. Furthermore, to this theme, protagonists in his films often come from families with divorced parents, including ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' (protagonist Elliot's mother is divorced) and ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' (Frank Abagnale's mother and father split early on in the film). Little known also is Tim in ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (early in the film, another secondary character mentions Tim and Lex's parents' divorce). The family often shown divided is often resolved in the ending as well. Following this theme of reluctant fathers and father figures, Tim looks to Dr. Alan Grant as a father figure. Initially, Dr. Grant is reluctant to return those paternal feelings to Tim. However, by the end of the film, he has changed, and the kids even fall asleep with their heads on his shoulders.

Most of his films are generally optimistic in nature. Though some critics accuse his films of being a little overly sentimental, Spielberg feels it is fine as long as it is disguised. He is still a highly praised director as well as being credited as one of the most influential directors of all time. The influence comes from directors [[Frank Capra]] and [[John Ford]].&lt;ref name="culture show"&gt;{{cite video| title = The Culture Show| medium = TV|publisher=BBC|date = November 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages and children ===
Spielberg first met actress [[Amy Irving]] in 1976 at the suggestion of director [[Brian De Palma]], who knew he was looking for an actress to play in ''Close Encounters''. After meeting her, Spielberg told his co-producer [[Julia Phillips]], "I met a real heartbreaker last night."&lt;ref name=McBride /&gt;{{rp|293}} Although she was too young for the role, she and Spielberg began dating and she eventually moved into what she described as his "bachelor funky" house.&lt;ref name=McBride /&gt;{{rp|294}} They lived together for four years, but the stresses of their professional careers took a toll on their relationship. Irving wanted to be certain that whatever success she attained as an actress would be her own: "I don't want to be known as Steven's girlfriend," she said, and chose not to be in any of his films during those years.&lt;ref name=McBride /&gt;{{rp|295}}

As a result, they broke up in 1979, but remained close friends. Then in 1984 they renewed their romance, and in November 1985, they married, already having had a son, Max Samuel. After three and a half years of marriage, however, many of the same competing stresses of their careers caused them to divorce in 1989. They agreed to maintain homes near each other as to facilitate the shared custody and parenting of their son.&lt;ref name=McBride /&gt;{{rp|403}} Their divorce was recorded as the third most costly celebrity divorce in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = 'Most costly' celebrity divorces|publisher=BBC News|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6552597.stm|date = April 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spielberg subsequently developed a relationship with actress [[Kate Capshaw]], whom he met when he cast her in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]''. They married on October 12, 1991. Capshaw is a [[Conversion to Judaism|convert]] to Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Karen W.|last=Arenson|title=From 'Schindler's List,' a Jewish Mission|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/24/us/from-schindler-s-list-a-jewish-mission.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 24, 1995|accessdate=May 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Capshaw"&gt;{{cite book|last =Pogrebin| first =Abigail| title =[[Stars of David: Prominent Jews Talk About Being Jewish]]| publisher =Bantam Dell Pub Group|date=October 2005| isbn =0-7679-1612-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They currently move among their four homes in [[Pacific Palisades, California]]; Quelle Farm, [[Georgica Pond]] in [[East Hampton (village), New York|East Hampton, New York]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2002/09/19/0919feat_7.html "Billionaires on vacation: No. 80: Steven Spielberg"] by Christina Valhouli, ''Forbes'' magazine, September 19, 2002.

=== Religion ===
Spielberg grew up in a Jewish household, including having a [[bar mitzvah]] ceremony in Phoenix when he turned 13. He grew away from Judaism after his family moved to various cities during his high school years, where they became the only Jews in the neighborhood.&lt;ref name=Pogrebin /&gt;{{rp|29}} Before those years, his family was involved in the synagogue and had many Jewish friends and nearby relatives.

He remembers his grandparents telling him about their life in Russia, where they were subjected to religious persecution, causing them to eventually flee to the United States. He was made aware of [[the Holocaust]] by his parents, who he says talked about it all the time, and so it was always on my mind.&lt;ref name=Pogrebin /&gt;{{rp|30}} His father had lost between sixteen and twenty relatives during the Holocaust.&lt;ref name=McBride /&gt;{{rp|21}}

Spielberg "rediscovered the honor of being a Jew," he says, before he made ''Schindler's List'', when he married Kate Capshaw.&lt;ref name=Pogrebin&gt;Pogrebin, Abigail. ''Stars of David'', Broadway Books, NY, (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}} Until then, having become a filmmaker, he only felt his connection to Judaism when he visited his parents. He says he made the film partly to create something that would confirm my Judaism to my family and myself.&lt;ref name=Loshitzky&gt;Loshitzky, Yosefa. ''Spielberg's Holocaust: Critical Perspectives on Schindler's List,'' Indiana Univ. Press (1997) p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Kate is Protestant and she insisted on converting to Judaism. She spent a year studying, did the "[[mikveh]]," the whole thing. She chose to do a full conversion ''before'' we were married in 1991, and she married me after becoming a Jew. I think ''that'', more than anything else, brought me back to Judaism.&lt;ref name=Pogrebin /&gt;{{rp|25}}}}

He credits her with fueling his family's current level of observance and for keeping the "momentum flowing" in their lives, as they now observe Jewish holidays, light candles on Friday nights, and give their children [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]]s.&lt;ref name=Pogrebin /&gt;{{rp|26}} "This [[shiksa]] goddess has made me a better Jew than my own parents."&lt;ref name=Pogrebin /&gt;{{rp|27}}

Producing ''Schindler's List'' in 1993 also renewed his faith, Spielberg says, but "it really was the fact that my wife took a profound interest in Judaism."&lt;ref name=Pogrebin /&gt;{{rp|25}} He waited ten years after being given the story in 1982 to make the film, as he did not yet feel "mature" enough.&lt;ref name=Pogrebin /&gt;{{rp|32}} He first wanted to have a family, "to figure out what my place was in the world... . When my first son, [Max] was born, it greatly affected me... . A spirit began to ignite in me, and I became a Jewish dad..."&lt;ref name=McBride /&gt;{{rp|21}}

He said that making the film became a natural experience for him, adding, "I ''had'' to tell the story. I've lived on its outer edges."&lt;ref name=McBride /&gt; The film, writes biographer [[Joseph McBride (writer)|Joseph McBride]], thereby became the "culmination" of Spielberg's long personal struggle with his Jewish identity.&lt;ref name=McBride2&gt;McBride, Joseph. ''Steven Spielberg: A Biography (3rd edition)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}} Some claim the film has made Spielberg "the one true heir to the great Jewish moguls who created Hollywood," most of whom had actively avoided depicting Jews or the Holocaust in their films.&lt;ref name=Loshitzky /&gt;

=== Wealth ===
''[[Forbes]]'' magazine places Spielberg's personal net worth at $3.7 billion.&lt;ref name="forbes1" /&gt;

The annual list is conducted by E-Poll Market Research and it gave more than 6,600 celebrities on 46 different personality attributes a score representing "how that person is perceived as influencing the public, their peers, or both." Spielberg received a score of 47, meaning 47% of the US believes he is influential.

=== Stalking ===

Simon and Schuster, 2004. {{ISBN|0-7432-3568-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Jess Cagle, the managing editor of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', called Spielberg "...arguably (well, who would argue?) the greatest filmmaker in history."&lt;ref&gt;"Spielberg and You"  Entertainment Weekly.

*[[French New Wave]] filmmaker [[Jean-Luc Godard]] stated that he holds Spielberg partly responsible for the lack of artistic merit in mainstream cinema and accused Spielberg of using his film ''[[Schindler's List]]'' to make a profit off tragedy while Schindler's wife, [[Emilie Schindler]], lived in poverty in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bill|last=Gibron|title=Short Cuts&amp;nbsp; Forgotten Gems: In Praise of Love|publisher=Pop Matters|date=April 21, 2007|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/blogs/shortends_post/33421/short-cuts-forgotten-gems-in-praise-of-love-2001|accessdate=April 28, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070424103927/http://www.popmatters.com/pm/blogs/shortends_post/33421/short-cuts-forgotten-gems-in-praise-of-love-2001|archivedate=April 24, 2007|df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In defense of Spielberg, critic [[Roger Ebert]] said "Has Godard or any other director living or dead done more than Spielberg, with his Holocaust Project, to honor and preserve the memories of the survivors?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Roger Ebert|title = In Praise of Love|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date = October 18, 2002|url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021018/REVIEWS/210180306/1023|accessdate=April 28, 2007|authorlink = Roger Ebert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Thomas Keneally]] has also disputed claims that Emilie Schindler was never paid for her contributions to the film, "not least because I had recently sent Emilie a check myself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url = https://books.google.com/?id=vg1Gw6VSK98C&amp;pg=PA265&amp;lpg=PA265&amp;dq=%22searching+for+schindler%22+%22not+a+penny%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| title = Searching for Schindler: A Memoir| isbn = 978-0-385-52617-3| author1 = Keneally| first1 = Thomas| year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Film critic [[Pauline Kael]], who had championed Spielberg's films in the 1970s, expressed disappointment in his later development, stating that "he's become, I think, a very bad director.... And I'm a little ashamed for him, because I loved his early work.... [H]e turned to virtuous movies. And he's become so uninteresting now.... I think that he had it in him to become more of a fluid, far-out director. But, instead, he's become a melodramatist."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Afterglow: A Last Conversation with Pauline Kael]]'' by [[Francis Davis]], [[Da Capo Press]], 2003, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Imre Kertsz]], Hungarian Jewish author, [[Nazi concentration camps|Nazi concentration camp]] survivor, and winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], criticized Spielberg's depiction of the Holocaust in ''Schindler's List'' as [[kitsch]], saying "I regard as kitsch any representation of the Holocaust that is incapable of understanding or unwilling to understand the organic connection between our own deformed mode of life and the very possibility of the Holocaust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/holocaust/reflections.htm|title=Holocaust Reflections|publisher=English.illinois.edu|accessdate=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veteran documentary filmmaker and professor [[Claude Lanzmann]] also labeled ''Schindler's List'' "pernicious in its impact and influence" and "very sentimental".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', December 6, 2010 [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/movies/07shoah.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all Maker of 'Shoah' Stresses Its Lasting Value]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Stephen Rowley wrote an extensive essay about Spielberg and his career in ''[[Senses of Cinema]]''. In it, he discussed Spielberg's strengths as a filmmaker, saying "there is a welcome complexity of tone and approach in these later films that defies the lazy stereotypes often bandied about his films" and that "Spielberg continues to take risks, with his body of work continuing to grow more impressive and ambitious", concluding that he has only received "limited, begrudging recognition" from critics.&lt;ref name="Rowley" /&gt;
*[[Shia LaBeouf]], who worked with Spielberg on a number of films including ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' and various [[DreamWorks]] productions (such as the [[Transformers (film series)|''Transformers'' film series]]), described his experiences working with the director in a wide-ranging interview with [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] in 2016. He stated, "I grew up with this idea, [that] if you got to Spielberg, thats where it is  Im not talking about fame, and Im not talking about money. You get there, and you realize youre not meeting the Spielberg you dream of. Youre meeting a different Spielberg, who is in a different stage in his career. Hes less a director than he is a fucking company." He went on to discuss his on-set actor/director relationship with Spielberg, as well as the films they made together, "Spielbergs sets are very different  everything has been so meticulously planned. You got to get this line out in 37 seconds. You do that for five years, you start to feel like not knowing what youre doing for a living." He concluded his point by stating: "I dont like the movies that I made with Spielberg. The only movie that I liked that we made together was [the first] ''Transformers'' [film]." Later in the interview, LaBeouf recited and criticised the advice given to him by Spielberg following the mixed reaction to both ''Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'', and LaBeouf's performance in the film. He claims Spielberg told him not to read about himself in the media, but LaBeouf felt irritated by what he perceived to be non-advice and a lack of understanding, saying "Theres no way to not do that. For me to not read that means I need to not take part in society. The generation previous to mine didnt have the immediate response [of the internet]. If you were Mark Hamill [in ''Star Wars''], you could lie to yourself. You could find the pockets of joy, and turn a blind eye to the shit over there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Setoodeh|first1=Ramin|title=How Shia LaBeouf Stopped Drinking and Found the Career He Wanted|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/shia-labeouf-drinking-steven-spielberg-american-honey-1201851776/|website=Variety|publisher=Variety Media, LLC|accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 1999, Spielberg, then a co-owner of [[DreamWorks]], was involved in a heated debate in which the studio proposed building on [[wetland]]s near Los Angeles, though development was later dropped for economic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Entertainment Spielberg Studio Plan axed|publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=July 22, 1999|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/384010.stm|accessdate=October 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In August 2007, [[Ai Weiwei]], artistic consultant for the [[Beijing National Stadium|Beijing Olympic Stadium]], known as the "Bird's Nest", accused those choreographing the Olympic opening ceremony, including Spielberg, of failing to live up to their responsibility as artists by allowing their work to be used by the Chinese government, which has suppressed human rights in China, including those of Ai's family, for the purpose of "propaganda". Ai said, "It's disgusting. I don't like anyone who shamelessly abuses their profession, who makes no moral judgment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Watts, Jonathan|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2007/08/11/2003373696|title=Olympic artist lashes out over PRC propaganda|work=[[Taipei Times]]|date=August 11, 2007|accessdate=July 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
