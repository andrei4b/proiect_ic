When Williams was nine, she and her family moved from Compton to [[West Palm Beach, Florida]],&lt;ref name="Serenabio" /&gt; so that she could attend the tennis academy of [[Rick Macci]]; Macci began to provide additional coaching. Macci did not always agree with Williams's father, but respected that "he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blackathlete.net/artman2/publish/Tennis_35/Venus_Serena_Reflect_As_They_Prepare_For_Fed_Cup_3202.shtml|title = Venus, Serena reflect as they prepare for Fed Cup| publisher=blackathlete.net | accessdate =April 22, 2009|first=Michelle |last=Kaufman |date = April 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was 10, since he wanted them to go slowly and to focus on school work. Experiences of racism also drove this experience, as Richard Williams had heard white parents talk about the Williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments.&lt;ref name="Newsweek1998"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/1012925/venus-serena-against-world |title=Venus And Serena Against The World |first=Marc |last=Peyser |first2=Allison |last2=Samuels |date=August 24, 1998 |work=Newsweek |accessdate=April 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Williams had a 463 record on the [[United States Tennis Association]] junior tour and was ranked number one among under-10 players in Florida.&lt;ref name="EdmonsonsEarly"&gt;Edmonson, 2005, ''Venus and Serena Williams'', pp. 4647.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, when Williams was in the ninth grade, her father pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy and, from then on, took over all coaching at their home. When asked in 2000 whether having followed the normal path of playing regularly on the junior circuit would have been beneficial, Williams responded: "Everyone does different things. I think for Venus and I, we just attempted a different road, and it worked for us."&lt;ref name="EdmonsonsEarly" /&gt;

==Playing style==
Williams is primarily a [[Tennis strategy#Baseliner strategies|baseline player]], and her game is built around taking immediate control of rallies with her powerful and consistent serve,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/aus08/news/story?id=3207822 |title=Gimpy Jankovic swats away defending champion Williams|publisher=ESPN | last= Ford|first= Bonnie D.|date=January 22, 2008|accessdate=April 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; return of serve, and forceful [[groundstroke]]s from both her [[forehand]] and [[backhand]] swings. Williams's forehand is considered to be among the most powerful shots in the women's game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = U.S. Open 2014: Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova and Sam Stosur Among Best Tennis Strokes|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/25/sports/tennis/us-open-2014-serena-williams-maria-sharapova-and-agnieszka-radwanska-among-best-tennis-strokes.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = August 24, 2014|access-date = July 29, 2015|issn = 0362-4331|first = Christopher|last = Clarey}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is her double-handed backhand. Williams strikes her backhand groundstroke using an open stance, and uses the same open stance for her forehand. Williams's aggressive play, a "high risk" style, is balanced in part by her serve, which most say is the greatest in women's tennis history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/12739719/stars-serve-praise-serena-williams-biggest-weapon |title=20 For 20: Stars Serve Up Praise of Serena Williams' Biggest Weapon |publisher=ESPN |date=May 20, 2015 |accessdate=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/the-serve-returned |title=The Serve, Returned |work=The New Yorker|author=Reeves Wiedeman |date=September 5, 2012 |accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tennis.com/gear/2011/04/gear-talk-qa-with-pam-shriver/38721/ |title=Gear Talk: Q&amp;A With Pam Shriver |website=Tennis.com |date=April 7, 2011 |first=Richard |last=Pagliaro |accessdate=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She consistently projects great pace and placement with her serves; in the 2013 Australian Open, she had a peak serve speed of {{convert|128.6|mph|abbr=on}} which is the third fastest all-time among female players (only [[Venus Williams|Venus's]] 129&amp;nbsp;mph&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wtatennis.com/news/article/1978722/title/ids-serve-speed-leaders | title = IDS Serve Speed Leaders |date=November 3, 2015 |website = [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] | accessdate=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sabine Lisicki]]'s 131&amp;nbsp;mph&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/30/sabine-lisicki-record-fastest-serve-women-tennis-stanford |title=Sabine Lisicki sets record for fastest serve in women's tennis  but loses |author=Marcin Bryszak |work=The Guardian |date=July 30, 2014 |accessdate=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded speeds are faster).

Williams is known for producing exceptional comebacks, particularly on the Grand Slam level. She has won three Grand Slam singles titles after saving match points, (the 2003 Australian Open semifinal versus [[Kim Clijsters]], the 2005 Australian Open semifinal versus [[Maria Sharapova]], and the 2009 Wimbledon semifinal versus [[Elena Dementieva]]), a feat achieved more often than any other player in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tennisplanet.me/blog/2012/06/grand-slam-champions-who-saved-match-points-from-2000-is-djokovic-about-to-make-his-second-entry-her.html | title = Grand slam champions who saved match points (from 2000). | date = June 5, 2012 | work = Tennisplanet.me}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also came back from a 35 deficit in the third set against [[Kim Clijsters]] in the 1999 US Open en route to her first Grand Slam singles title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1102987/bio|title=Serena Williams|publisher=IMDb|access-date=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2012 US Open  Women's Singles|2012 US Open]] final against [[Victoria Azarenka]], she was down 35 in the third set and found herself two points away from losing the match.

In recent years, Williams has shown an ability to serve aces at critical moments. One of these instances was the [[2013 French Open  Women's Singles|2013 French Open]] final, where in the last game of the match, she fired three aces, including one which clocked at 123&amp;nbsp;mph (198&amp;nbsp;km/h) on match point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.independent.ie/sport/serena-williams-powers-to-her-16th-grand-slam-in-paris-29330611.html | title = Serena Williams powers to her 16th Grand Slam in Paris | last = Crooks | first = Eleanor | date = June 8, 2013 | work = The Irish Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2013/06/serena-williams-wins-roland-garros/47851/ | title = Serena Williams wins Roland Garros | work = [[Tennis (magazine)|Tennis.com]] |agency = Associated Press | date = June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She repeated the feat similarly against [[Angelique Kerber]] in the finals of the [[2016 Wimbledon Championships  Women's Singles|2016 Wimbledon Championships]] to tie the Open Era record for Grand Slam singles titles. Williams fired three un-returnable serves in her final service game before winning the match and the title with a casual forehand volley on the next point.

She then defeated in succession Grand Slam champions [[Kim Clijsters]], [[Conchita Martnez]], [[Monica Seles]], and defending champion Lindsay Davenport to reach the [[1999 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] final, where she defeated No. 1, Hingis, to become the second African-American woman, after [[Althea Gibson]] in 1958, to win a Grand Slam singles tournament.&lt;ref name="WTA profile" /&gt; The Williams sisters also won the doubles title at this tournament. To complete her 1999 season, Williams won a doubles match in the Fed Cup final against Russia. Williams ended the year ranked No. 4 in just her second full year on the main tour.

Williams started 2000 by losing in the fourth round of the [[2000 Australian Open|Australian Open]] to [[Elena Likhovtseva]]. She failed to defend her titles in Paris and Indian Wells, although she did win the [[Faber Grand Prix]] in Germany. Soon afterwards, Williams missed the [[2000 French Open|French Open]] because of injury. She returned from injury at [[2000 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], where she lost to Venus in the semifinals, but the pair won the doubles title at the event. Williams successfully defended her title in Los Angeles, defeating Davenport in the final. She reached the final of the [[Rogers Cup (tennis)|Du Maurier Open]] where an injury forced her to retire from her match with Hingis. Her defense of the [[2000 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] title ended when she lost in the quarterfinals to Davenport. Williams teamed with Venus to win the gold medal in doubles at the [[Sydney Olympics]] that September. She ended the year winning the [[Toyota Princess Cup]] in Japan and she finished the year ranked No. 6.

Williams began 2001 losing to Martina Hingis in the quarterfinals of the Medibank International in [[Medibank International|Sydney]] and the Australian Open in Melbourne. Williams and her sister won the doubles title at the latter tournament, becoming only the fifth doubles team in history to win all four Grand Slam women's doubles titles during their career, completing a "Career Grand Slam". Her next event was the [[Pacific Life Open]] in California, where she defeated Kim Clijsters in the final. However, the final was marred by the behavior of the crowd toward Williams and her family. Crowd members were incensed at the perceived match fixing of games involving the family after [[Boycott of BNP Paribas Open by Venus and Serena Williams|Venus withdrew]] before their semifinal. Neither Williams nor her sister entered the tournament for fourteen years until Williams entered in 2015 as a wildcard (and the top seed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://sports.yahoo.com/tennis/blog/busted_racquet/post/Indian-Wells-boycott-hurts-Williamses-more-than-?urn=ten,149332 |title=Indian Wells boycott hurts Williamses more than it helps

She then lost in the quarterfinals to Capriati at both the [[2001 French Open|French Open]] and [[2001 Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]. This was the fourth consecutive Grand Slam tournament at which Williams had exited in the quarterfinals. During the North American hard-court season, she lost in the quarterfinals of [[East West Bank Classic|Los Angeles]] against Monica Seles, then captured her second title of the year at the [[Rogers Cup (tennis)|Rogers Cup]], defeating Capriati in the final. Williams reached the final of the 2001 US Open, losing to sister Venus. That was the first Grand Slam tournament final contested by two sisters during the [[Open Era]]. At the 2001 season-ending [[WTA Tour Championships|Tour Championships]], Williams won the championship by walkover when Davenport withdrew before the start of the final due to a knee injury. Williams finished 2001 at No. 6 for the second straight year.

===200203: "Serena Slam"===
Early 2002, injury saw Williams retire from the semifinal at the [[Medibank International Sydney]] and later withdraw from the [[2002 Australian Open|Australian Open]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/14/sports/tennis-agassi-and-serena-williams-withdraw-in-australia-kuerten-is-beaten.html|title=TENNIS; Agassi and Serena Williams Withdraw in Australia; Kuerten Is Beaten|last=Clarey|first=Christopher|date=January 14, 2002|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:SWilliams-SYD-1.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;Playing Amlie Mauresmo in the quarterfinals of the tournament in Sydney in 2002&lt;/div&gt;]]

Returning from injury, Williams won her first title of the year in [[State Farm Women's Tennis Classic|Scottsdale, Arizona]], defeating No. 2 Jennifer Capriati, in the final. She then won the Miami Masters for the first time, becoming one of three players in the [[Open Era]] to defeat the world's top 3 ranked players at one tournament,&lt;ref name="WTA profile" /&gt; after beating No. 3, Martina Hingis, in the quarterfinals, No. 2 Venus in the semifinals, and the top ranked player, Capriati, in the final. Serena's straight set win over Venus was her second career win over her sister.

Williams played three clay-court tournaments before the [[2002 French Open]]. Her first tournament was at [[Family Circle Cup|Charleston]], where she was the third seed. Williams reached the quarterfinals before losing to [[Patty Schnyder]]. She reached her first clay-court final in May, at the [[WTA German Open|Eurocard German Open]] losing to [[Justine Henin]] in a third set tiebreak. Williams went on to win her first clay court title at the [[Internazionali BNL d'Italia|Italian Open]], defeating Capriati in the semifinals and Henin in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2002/may/20/tennis1 |title=Hingis may be out to end of year |work=The Guardian |accessdate=April 23, 2009 |date=May 20, 2002 |first=Eleanor |last=Preston}}&lt;/ref&gt; This raised her ranking to a new high of No. 3. Williams was the third seed at the French Open at Roland Garros, where she claimed her first title there by defeating defending champion Capriati in the semifinals and sister Venus in the final to win her second Grand Slam tournament title (and her first in two-and-a-half years). As a result of raising the trophy at [[Court Philippe Chatrier]], Williams rose to a career high of No. 2, second only to Venus.

At [[2002 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], Williams won tennis' oldest championship for the first time in her life, defeating Venus to win a Grand Slam singles title without dropping a set for the first time in her career. This victory earned Williams the world No. 1 ranking for the first time in her life, dethroning her sister and becoming only the third African-American woman to hold that ranking.&lt;ref name="WTA profile" /&gt; The Williams sisters also won the doubles title at the tournament, the fifth Grand Slam doubles title for the pair. Williams played just one tournament between Wimbledon and the [[2002 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], losing in the quarterfinals of the [[JPMorgan Chase Open]] in Los Angeles to American [[Chanda Rubin]] and ending a 21-match winning streak. The top-seeded player at the US Open, Williams reached the final where, for the third Grand Slam in a row, she defeated her sister to win the title, the second US Open crown of her career. Williams won two consecutive singles titles in the fall, defeating Kim Clijsters to win the [[Toyota Princess Cup]] in Tokyo, and [[Anastasia Myskina]] to win the [[Sparkassen Cup (tennis)|Sparkassen Cup]] in Leipzig, Germany. She reached the final at the year-end [[WTA Tour Championships|Home Depot Championships]] at the [[Staples Center]] in Los Angeles, where she lost to fifth-seeded Clijsters in straight sets, ending an 18-match winning streak.

Williams finished 2002 with a 565 W/L record, eight singles titles, and the No. 1 ranking. She was the first African-American to end a year with that ranking since [[Althea Gibson]] in 1958 {{citation needed|accessdate=April 20, 2017|date=August 2015}} and was the first woman to win three Grand Slam tournament titles in one year since Hingis in 1997.&lt;ref name="WTA profile" /&gt; Her three consecutive Grand Slam titles to close 2002 also made Williams only the third player in tennis history to win the "Surface Slam",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1536384-forget-calendar-slam-surface-slam-almost-as-rare|title=Forget Calendar Slam, "Surface Slam" Almost as Rare |work=Bleacher Report|date=February 20, 2013|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; three Slam titles on three surfaces in the same calendar year, after Navratilova (1984) and Graf (1993, 1995, 1996).

At the [[2003 Australian Open]], Williams reached the tournament's semifinals for the first time, where she recovered from 51 down in the third set and saved two match points before defeating Clijsters. In the final, Serena faced Venus for the fourth consecutive Grand Slam tournament final, defeating her older sister to become the sixth woman in the Open Era to complete a career Grand Slam, alongside [[Margaret Court]], [[Billie Jean King]], [[Chris Evert]], [[Martina Navratilova]], and [[Steffi Graf]]. She also became the fifth woman to hold all Grand Slam singles titles simultaneously, joining [[Maureen Connolly Brinker]], Court, Graf, and Navratilova.

During the spring of 2003, Williams captured the singles titles at the [[Open Gaz de France]] and the [[Sony Ericsson Open]]. Williams's winning streak came to an end when she lost the final of the [[Family Circle Cup]] to Henin, her first loss of the year after 21 wins. She also lost to Mauresmo in the semifinals of the [[Internazionali BNL d'Italia]] in Rome. Despite these losses, Williams was the top seed at the [[2003 French Open  Women's Singles|French Open]], where she lost in the semifinals to eventual champion Henin, marking Williams's first loss in a Grand Slam tournament since 2001. The match was controversial, as Williams questioned Henin's sportsmanship, and spectators applauded Williams's errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/french_open_2003/2967190.stm| title = Williams 'hurt' by jeers |accessdate=May 30, 2017| publisher = [[BBC Sport]]

Although ranked No. 7, Williams was seeded second at the French Open, where, after winning four matches, she lost to Capriati in the quarterfinals. This was the first time that Williams had lost before the semifinals at a Grand Slam singles tournament since Wimbledon in 2001. A few weeks later, even though her ranking had dropped to No. 10, Williams was seeded first at [[2004 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]]. She won six matches en route to the final, where she was defeated by 13th-seeded Sharapova in straight sets. This loss caused her ranking to drop out of the top 10 for the first time since 1999.

She reached the final without dropping a set, including wins over No. 5, Maria Sharapova, and No. 4, Agnieszka Radwaska, and faced first time Grand Slam finalist [[Angelique Kerber]].

The week of February 15 marked Williams's 157th consecutive week ranked No. 1, passing Navratilova's mark of 156 to have the second-longest run in WTA history behind Steffi Graf's 186. She competed in [[2016 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells]] as the No. 1 seed. She reached her first final here since winning in 2001 and before boycotting the event, by defeating Simona Halep in the quarterfinals and Agnieszka Radwaska in the semifinals. She did not drop a set en route to the final. However, Williams was upset by No. 13 seed Victoria Azarenka, whom she had defeated the last five times the pair had met, in straight sets. This marked the first time since 2004 where Williams lost two consecutive finals. She next played the [[2016 Miami Open|Miami Open]] as the defending champion. She lost in the fourth round to Svetlana Kuznetsova. This marked her first loss here since 2012 and ended her 20 match winning streak in Miami. This was also her earliest exit here since 2000, where she lost in the same round. During the clay court swing, Williams withdrew from Madrid but entered Rome. She beat [[Anna-Lena Friedsam]] and [[Christina McHale]] to progress to the quarterfinals where she defeated Svetlana Kuznetsova to avenge her loss in Miami. She then went on to beat [[Irina-Camelia Begu]] and [[Madison Keys]] to win her 70th career WTA title and to win her first title of the year. This was her third Rome title in four years and fourth overall.

At the [[2016 French Open|French Open]], Williams dropped only one set en route to the final. She defeated [[Yulia Putintseva]] in the quarter-finals despite being five points away from losing. She then beat surprise semi-finalist [[Kiki Bertens]] to reach her fourth French Open final where she faced Garbie Muguruza in a repeat of last year's Wimbledon final where Williams was victorious. However, the result was not the same as that Wimbledon final as Williams lost to Muguruza in straight sets. With this loss, Williams had lost two consecutive Grand Slam finals for the first time in her career. On top of failing to equal Steffi Graf's Open Era record of 22 Grand Slam singles titles, Williams also completed the Career Grand Slam runner-up set with this loss.

At [[2016 Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], Williams only lost one set en route to the final where she faced Angelique Kerber in a rematch of their Australian Open final earlier in the year. This time, Williams defeated Kerber in straight sets to finally equal Steffi Graf's record of 22 Grand Slams in the Open Era. This was Williams's first Grand Slam title of the year, as well as her 71st career WTA title overall. In what was a brilliant serving performance, Williams only faced one break point in the whole match against Kerber which she saved with an ace. Later that day, Williams partnered with sister Venus to win their sixth Wimbledon doubles title and 14th doubles Grand Slam title overall, keeping their perfect record at Grand Slam doubles finals intact. On July 24, 2016, Williams withdrew from [[2016 Rogers Cup|Rogers Cup]] citing a shoulder inflammation injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/tennis/news/12040/10511583/serena-williams-withdraws-from-rogers-cup-in-montreal|title=Serena Williams withdraws from the Rogers Cup in Montreal|publisher=[[Sky Sports]]|date=July 24, 2016|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She next participated in the [[2016 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], where she was the defending gold medalist in both singles and doubles and was the heavy favourite to retain those titles.

The week of September 5, 2016, marked Williams's 186th consecutive week ranked No. 1, equalling Steffi Graf's record for longest run in WTA history. However, in the semifinals of the US Open, Williams lost to [[Karolna Plkov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eurosport.com/tennis/us-open-women/2016/serena-williams-v-karolina-pliskova-us-open-live_sto5835691/story.shtml|title=Serena Williams suffers shock US Open semi-final defeat to Karolina Pliskova|date=2016-09-09|work=Eurosport|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having won the US Open, Angelique Kerber became the No. 1, ending Williams's No. 1 streak. Williams also pulled out of the WTA Finals due to a shoulder injury.

===2017: Australian Open victory and pregnancy===
{{Main article|2017 Serena Williams tennis season}}
Williams started her 2017 season by participating in the [[WTA Auckland Open]] for the first time in her career. She defeated [[Pauline Parmentier]] to win her first match played since the US Open. In the second round however, Williams surprisingly lost to [[Madison Brengle]]. Williams displayed her top form from the outset of the Australian Open. Williams beat former and present top 10 players [[Belinda Bencic]], Lucie afov, [[Johanna Konta]] among others to reach her 8th Australian Open Final. On January 28, 2017, Williams won the Australian Open for an Open Era record seventh time, defeating her sister, Venus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Serena-Williams|title=Serena Williams {{!}} Biography, Titles, &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopdia Britannica|access-date=August 8, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was her 23rd Grand Slam singles title, surpassing Steffi Graf's Open Era record of 22.

On December 30, 2017 Williams played an exhibition match at the [[World Tennis Championship]] in [[Abu Dhabi]], losing to reigning Roland Garros Champion [[Jeena Ostapenko]] 26, 63, [510].

=== 2018: Return to tennis ===
After overcoming her pregnancy induced problems, Williams returned to the tennis court with her sister. They lost 62 63 to Lesley Kerkhove and Demi Schuurs (Netherlands) in the Fed Cup's first round on February 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jezebel.com/serena-williams-made-her-return-to-competitive-tennis-t-1822914914|title=Serena Williams Made Her Return to Competitive Tennis This Weekend|last=Fishbein|first=Rebecca|work=Jezebel|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Despite saying she was 100% ready to come back to tennis, Serena suffered back to back early exits at Indian Wells &amp; Miami, losing third round at Indian Wells to her sister Venus and first round at Miami losing to 2018 Indian Wells champion Naomi Osaka.

Williams made her return to Grand Slam tennis at the [[2018 French Open]].

Williams has played older sister [[Venus Williams|Venus]] in 29 professional matches since 1998.&lt;ref name=headtohead/&gt; Overall, Serena is 1712 against her sister.&lt;ref name=headtohead/&gt; Serena has played Venus 15 times in Grand Slam singles and 13 times in other tournaments (including 11 finals).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/espnw/news-commentary/slideshow/18550742/serena-vs-venus-rivalry-lifetime|title=14 major showdowns between tennis legends Serena Williams and Venus Williams|work=espnW|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have met in nine Grand Slam tournament finals, with Serena winning seven times.&lt;ref name=headtohead/&gt; Beginning with the [[2002 French Open]], they played each other in four consecutive Grand Slam finals, which was the first time in the [[Tennis open era|Open Era]] that the same two players had contested consecutive finals in Grand Slam singles.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

They first played each other at the 1998 Miami Open where Hingis won in three sets. All but one of their matches was played on a hard court with the exception being a contest on clay in Rome 1999, which Hingis won in straight sets.

The umpire did not see Henin raise her hand, and thus did not allow Williams a first serve. Williams lost the game and would go on to lose the match. Their last match took place in the final of the 2010 Australian Open where Williams won in three sets, earning her 12th Grand Slam title.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==Match controversies==
===Accusations of match fixing===
When both the Williams sisters entered the top ten and started meeting in tournaments, unsubstantiated rumors of [[match fixing]] started to circulate. [[John McEnroe]], while commenting on the 2000 Wimbledon semifinal between the two sisters, said that "Serena may not be allowed to win. Richard may have something to say about this."&lt;ref&gt;wine, Steve (July 6, 2000), ([https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2026&amp;dat=20000705&amp;id=2b8jAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=29AFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1781,581859 "Williams Sister Giving Tennis a Lift with Family Fued"]. ''Moscow-Pullman Daily News''. Retrieved April 29, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elena Dementieva]], a fellow professional player, said during a post match interview after losing to Venus at the Indian Wells quarterfinals in 2001, that Richard Williams decided the results between the two sisters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=35375 "ASAP Sports Transcripts  Tennis  2001  TMS  INDIAN WELLS, WOMEN  March 14  Elena Dementieva"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423001654/http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=35375 |date=April 23, 2016}}. ''asapsports.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; Venus pulling out at the last minute garnered much speculation in the press, with fans demanding their money back.&lt;ref name="etank"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/columns/kreidler/1158786.html |title=ESPN: There's no evidence to prove the sisters tanked}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="swn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsworldnews.com/articles/42575/20150706/wimbledon-rumors-new-accusation-of-fixed-matches-between-serena-venus-williams-video.htm |title=New accusation of fixed matches between Serena, Venus Williams |publisher=Sports World News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telfix"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/atptour/3001048/Williams-denies-match-fixing-as-crowd-demand-refunds.html |title=Telegraph: Williams denies match-fixing as crowd demand refunds |work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2001 Indian Wells===
After injuring herself in the quarterfinal match against Dementieva, her sister, Venus Williams, defaulted to Serena in the semifinals. Although Venus told the tournament official hours beforehand that she would have to default, the official word was not given until 10 minutes before the scheduled start (in the hopes that Venus would change her mind), angering fans who had come to see the match. Consequently, during the final against Kim Clijsters two days later, the spectators jeered Serena from when she first took the court for warm-up through the final trophy presentation including cheering double faults and errors with no intervention from the tournament officials. Despite these attacks, Williams went on to win the tournament.

At the Ericsson Open the following week, Richard Williams said racist comments were made to him in the stands,&lt;ref&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/stories/2001-03-26-focus-williams.htm "USATODAY.com  Richard Williams decries fans as racist"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315211821/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/stories/2001-03-26-focus-williams.htm |date=March 15, 2015}}. ''usatoday.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the tournament director refused to offer Williams an apology for how she was treated. As a result, neither sister played the tournament even though it had become a mandatory stop on the WTA tour since 2009. In 2015, Williams decided to end her 14-year boycott and played.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/tennis/story/_/id/12277217/serena-williams-wants-rewrite-indian-wells-ending "Serena 'proudly returning' to tourney"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818074222/http://espn.go.com/tennis/story/_/id/12277217/serena-williams-wants-rewrite-indian-wells-ending |date=August 18, 2015}}. ESPN.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004 US Open===
In her [[2004 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] quarterfinal match against [[Jennifer Capriati]], an incorrect overrule was made by chair umpire [[Mariana Alves]], the video review showed this to be an error (as Williams's shot was inside the court. This quarter-final match (did test the new technology  during the match) was testing the new technology. There were incorrect lines calls made late in the third set of the match. Williams argued with the chair over a couple of calls during the match, but was not successful. Capriati won the match, but tournament officials dismissed Alves from the tournament, and she was suspended. The controversy renewed calls for, and was widely given credit for, the adoption of technology such as the [[MacCAM]] and [[Hawk-Eye]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/5933547 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105051331/http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/5933547 |archivedate=November 5, 2013 |title=Officials apologize to Serena for bad call  U.S. Open, Aug.&amp;nbsp;30-Sept. 12- NBC Sports |publisher=MSNBC |date= September 9, 2004 |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 US Open===
In the [[2009 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] semifinal round against [[Kim Clijsters]], Williams slammed her racquet on the court after losing the first set. She was given a warning, with a potential second violation carrying a one-point penalty. While trailing 46, 56, 1530, Williams's second serve was called a [[foot fault]], resulting in two match points for Clijsters. Williams gestured with her racquet to the lineswoman who had made the call and yelled at her, with profanities and a threat to shove a tennis ball down the lineswoman's throat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Serena Williams is fined $10,500 for US Open line judge tirade |work=The Guardian | date= September 14, 2009 | url= https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/13/serena-williams-tirade-us-open | accessdate=June 5, 2010 | first=Lawrence | last=Donegan}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the subsequent on-court conference between the chair umpire, the lineswoman, US Open officials, and Williams, a television microphone picked up Williams saying to the lineswoman, "I didn't say I would kill you!

===2011 US Open===
In the final of the [[2011 US Open (tennis)|2011 US Open]] against [[Samantha Stosur]], Williams shouted "Come on!" as the Australian attempted to return a [[forehand]] Williams believed to be a winner. The chair umpire [[Eva Asderaki]] awarded the point to Stosur based on the [[United States Tennis Association|USTA]]'s deliberate hindrance rule, which states, "If a player commits any act which hinders his opponent in making a stroke, then, if this is deliberate, he shall lose the point or if involuntary, the point shall be replayed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tennis4you.com/links/rules/rules.htm#R21 |agency=Tennis 4 You |title=RULE 21 : Player Hinders Opponent |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930064130/http://www.tennis4you.com/links/rules/rules.htm |archivedate=September 30, 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the point was 3040 on Williams's serve, the penalty gave the break of serve to Stosur.

Williams responded by tweeting her displeasure, saying, "@TennysSandgren I don't need or want one. But there is a entire group of people that deserves an apology. I cant look at my daughter and tell her I sat back and was quiet. No! she will know how to stand up for herself and others- through my example."

"It's so rare when athletes at the top of their game are willing to embrace a set of issues that, for a lot of people, are edgier", he said. "This is not aid to orphans ... She was standing when a lot of her contemporaries remain seated, speaking up when others are being quiet."&lt;ref name="SPOTY15"&gt;{{cite journal|last=PRICE|first=S.L. |date=December 21, 2015|title=Serena Williams is Sports Illustrated's 2015 Sportsperson of the Year|journal=Sports Illustrated|volume=123|issue=24|page=76|url=https://www.si.com/sportsperson/2015/12/14/serena-williams-si-sportsperson-year|accessdate=December 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
