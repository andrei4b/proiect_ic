An eight-time [[List of multiple Olympic gold medalists|Olympic gold medalist]], Bolt won the 100&amp;nbsp;m, 200&amp;nbsp;m and 4  100 m relay at three consecutive Olympic Games, although he lost the 2008 relay gold medal about nine years after the fact due to a teammate's doping disqualification. He gained worldwide fame for his double sprint victory at the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]] in world record times, which made him the first person to hold both records since [[fully automatic time]] became mandatory. Bolt is the only sprinter to win [[100 metres at the Olympics|Olympic 100 m]] and [[200 metres at the Olympics|200 m]] titles at three consecutive Olympics (2008, 2012 and 2016).

An eleven-time [[World Championships in Athletics|World Champion]], he won consecutive [[100 metres at the World Championships in Athletics|World Championship 100&amp;nbsp;m]], [[200 metres at the World Championships in Athletics|200&amp;nbsp;m]] and [[4  100 metres relay at the World Championships in Athletics|4  100 metres relay]] gold medals from 2009 to 2015, with the exception of a 100&amp;nbsp;m [[false start]] in 2011. He is the [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics#Multiple medallist|most successful athlete]] of the World Championships, was the first athlete to win four World Championship titles in the 200&amp;nbsp;m and is the joint-most successful in the 100&amp;nbsp;m with three titles.

Bolt improved upon his second [[Men's 100 metres world record progression|100&amp;nbsp;m world record]] of 9.69 with 9.58 seconds in 2009  the biggest improvement since the start of electronic timing. He has twice broken the [[Men's 200 metres world record progression|200 metres world record]], setting 19.30 in 2008 and 19.19 in 2009. He has helped Jamaica to three [[Men's 4  100 metres relay world record progression|4  100 metres relay world records]], with the current record being 36.84 seconds set in 2012. Bolt's most successful event is the 200 m, with three Olympic and four World titles. The 2008 Olympics was his international debut over 100&amp;nbsp;m; he had earlier won numerous 200&amp;nbsp;m medals (including [[2007 World Championships in Athletics|2007 World Championship]] silver) and holds the [[List of world junior records in athletics|world under-20]] and [[List of world youth bests in athletics|world under-18 records]] for the event.

His achievements as a sprinter have earned him the media nickname "Lightning Bolt", and his awards include the [[IAAF World Athlete of the Year]], [[Track &amp; Field Athlete of the Year]], and [[Laureus World Sports Award for Sportsman of the Year|Laureus World Sportsman of the Year]] (four times). Bolt retired after the [[2017 World Championships in Athletics|2017 World Championships]], when he finished third in his last solo 100&amp;nbsp;m race.

===Early competitions===
Performing for Jamaica in his first Caribbean regional event, Bolt clocked a personal best time of 48.28 s in the [[400 metres]] in the 2001 [[CARIFTA Games]], winning a silver medal. The 200 m also yielded a silver, as Bolt finished in 21.81 s.&lt;ref name=Carifta&gt;{{cite web |title=Carifta Games (Under 17 boys) |publisher=GBR Athletics |url=http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/cfgy.htm |accessdate=17 August 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917055503/http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/cfgy.htm |archivedate=17 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his first appearance on the world stage at the [[2001 World Youth Championships in Athletics|2001 IAAF World Youth Championships]] in [[Debrecen]], Hungary. Running in the 200 m event, he failed to qualify for the finals, but he still set a new personal best of 21.73 s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Official Results  200 metres  Men  semi-final |publisher=[[IAAF]] |date=14 July 2001 |url=http://www2.iaaf.org/WYC01/Results/data/M/200/Rsf.html |accessdate=17 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916213329/http://www2.iaaf.org/WYC01/Results/data/M/200/Rsf.html |archivedate=16 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolt still did not take athletics or himself too seriously, however, and he took his mischievousness to new heights by hiding in the back of a van when he was supposed to be preparing for the 200 m finals at the CARIFTA Trials. He was detained by the police for his practical joke, and there was an outcry from the local community, which blamed coach McNeil for the incident.&lt;ref name=McNeil/&gt; However, the controversy subsided, and both McNeil and Bolt went to the CARIFTA Games, where Bolt set championship records in the 200 m and 400 m with times of 21.12 s and 47.33 s, respectively.&lt;ref name=Carifta/&gt; He continued to set records with 20.61 s and 47.12 s finishes at the [[Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships |publisher=GBR Athletics |url=http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/cacy.htm |accessdate=17 August 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919084651/http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/cacy.htm |archivedate=19 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolt is one of only nine athletes (along with [[Valerie Adams]], [[Veronica Campbell-Brown]], [[Jacques Freitag]], [[Yelena Isinbayeva]], [[Jana Pittman]], [[Dani Samuels]], [[David Storl]], and [[Kirani James]]) to win world championships at the youth, junior, and senior level of an athletic event. Former Prime Minister [[P. J. Patterson]] recognised Bolt's talent and arranged for him to move to [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], along with [[Jermaine Gonzales]], so he could train with the [[Jamaica Amateur Athletic Association]] (JAAA) at the [[University of Technology, Jamaica]].&lt;ref name=McNeil/&gt;

===Rise to prominence===
The [[2002 World Junior Championships in Athletics|2002 World Junior Championships]] were held in front of a home crowd in Kingston, Jamaica, and Bolt was given a chance to prove his credentials on a world stage. By the age of 15, he had grown to {{convert|1.96|m|ftin}} tall, and he physically stood out among his peers.&lt;ref name=Focus/&gt; He won the 200 m in a time of 20.61 s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Official Results  200 metres  Men  Final |publisher=[[IAAF]] |date=19 July 2002 |url=http://www2.iaaf.org/WJC02/Results/data/M/200/Rf.html |accessdate=17 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823014902/http://www2.iaaf.org/WJC02/Results/data/M/200/Rf.html |archivedate=23 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was 0.03 s slower than his personal best of 20.58 s, which he set in the 1st round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Results  200 metres  Men  Heats |publisher=[[IAAF]] |date=18 July 2002 |url=http://www2.iaaf.org/WJC02/Results/data/M/200/Rh.html |accessdate=8 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727061449/http://www2.iaaf.org/WJC02/Results/data/M/200/Rh.html |archivedate=27 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolt's 200 m win made him the youngest world-junior gold medallist ever.&lt;ref name=Longmore/&gt; The expectation from the home crowd had made him so nervous that he had put his shoes on the wrong feet.

The year 2005 signalled a fresh start for Bolt in the form of a new coach, [[Glen Mills]], and a new attitude toward athletics.

Misfortune awaited Bolt at the next major event, the [[2005 World Championships in Athletics|2005 World Championships]] in Helsinki. Bolt felt that both his work ethic and athleticism had much improved since the 2004 Olympics, and he saw the World Championships as a way to live up to expectations, stating, "I really want to make up for what happened in Athens.

Bolt had aspired to run under twenty seconds to claim a season's best but, despite the fact that bad weather had impaired his run, he was happy to end the meeting with just the victory.&lt;ref name=NoSub/&gt; However, a sub-20-second finish was soon his, as he set a new personal best of 19.88 s at the 2006 [[Athletissima]] Grand Prix in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, finishing behind [[Xavier Carter]] and [[Tyson Gay]] to earn a bronze medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Liu eclipses Jackson with 110m hurdles record |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=12 June 2006 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/jul/12/athletics |accessdate=17 August 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830065833/http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/jul/12/athletics |archivedate=30 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolt had focused his athletics aims, stating that 2006 was a year to gain experience.

===2017 season===
Bolt took a financial stake in a new Australia-based track and field meeting series  [[Nitro Athletics]].

In 2017, the Jamaican team was disqualified from the results of the 2008 Olympics 4 x 100 metre relay due to [[Nesta Carter]]'s disqualification for doping offences. Bolt was quoted by the BBC saying that the prospect of having to return the gold was "heartbreaking".&lt;ref name=BBCJan17&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/38744846|title=Usain Bolt loses one Olympic gold medal as Nesta Carter tests positive|date=25 January 2017|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125144538/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/38744846|archivedate=25 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The banned substance in Carter's test was identified as methylhexanamine, a nasal decongestant sometimes used in dietary supplements.

At the [[2017 World Athletics Championships]], Bolt won his heat uncomfortably after a slow start in 10.07, in his semi-final he improved to 9.98 but was beaten by [[Christian Coleman]] by 0.01. In his final individual race, in the final, Bolt won the Bronze medal in 9.95, 0.01 behind Silver medalist Coleman and 0.03 behind World Champion [[Justin Gatlin]]. It was the first time Bolt had been beaten at a major championship since the 4x100m relay of the [[2007 World Athletics Championships]]. Also at the 2017 World Athletics Championships, Bolt participated as the anchor runner for Jamaica's 4x100-metre relay team. In what many expected would be his final race, Bolt collapsed to the track after an apparent hamstring injury. He refused to get in a wheelchair and crossed the finish line with the assistance of his teammates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/20324713/usain-bolt-injured-final-race-career-great-britain-wins-4x100-final|title=Bolt finale ends in injury and collapse, no gold|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-08-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813050749/http://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/20324713/usain-bolt-injured-final-race-career-great-britain-wins-4x100-final|archivedate=13 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He popularised the "lightning bolt" pose, also known as "to di world" or "bolting", which he used both before races and in celebration. The pose consists of extending a slightly raised left arm to the side and the right arm folded across the chest, with both hands have the thumb and [[index finger]] outstretched. His performance of the pose during his Olympic and World Championship victories led to widespread copying of the move, from American President [[Barack Obama]] to small children.

In September 2010, Bolt travelled to Australia where his sponsor [[Gatorade]] was holding an event called the "Gatorade Bolt" to find Australia's fastest footballer. The event was held at the [[Sydney International Athletic Centre]] and featured football players from [[rugby league]], [[rugby union]], [[Australian rules football]], and soccer. Prior to the race Bolt gave the runners some private coaching and also participated in the 10th anniversary celebrations for the [[2000 Summer Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wallaby winger Lachie Turner named footy's fastest man after 100m race|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/wallaby-winger-lachie-turner-named-footys-fastest-man-after-100m-race/story-e6frexni-1225924289700|agency=Daily Telegraph|date=16 August 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815093644/http://berlin.iaaf.org/images/photofinish/3658/m_100_f_1.jpg|archivedate=15 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Bolt impersonated [[Richard Branson]] in an advertising campaign for [[Virgin Media]].&lt;ref name="Usain Bolt mimics Richard Branson in Virgin Media superfast broadband ad"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/13/usain-bolt-richard-branson-virgin-media|title=Usain Bolt mimics Richard Branson in Virgin Media superfast broadband ad|work=The Guardian|accessdate=16 February 2012|location=London|first=Mark|last=Sweney|date=13 January 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205021248/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/13/usain-bolt-richard-branson-virgin-media|archivedate=5 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was directed by [[Seth Gordon]] and features the [[Virgin Group|Virgin]] founder Branson to promote its broadband service.

Bolt's autobiography, ''My Story: 9.58: Being the World's Fastest Man'', was released in 2010. Bolt had previously said that the book "...should be exciting, it's my life, and I'm a cool and exciting guy."&lt;ref name="english.rfi.fr"/&gt; His athletics agent is [[PACE Sports Management]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacesportsmanagement.com/athlete_profile.asp?id=158 Athlete Profile Usain Bolt] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203011128/http://www.pacesportsmanagement.com/athlete_profile.asp?id=158 |date=3 December 2013 }}.

As part of his sponsorship deal with Puma, the manufacturer sends sporting equipment to his alma mater, William Knibb Memorial High School, every year.

==Personal appearances==
Bolt made a cameo appearance in the opening sketch of 13 October 2012 broadcast of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', hosted by [[Christina Applegate]]. The segment was a parody of the [[United States vice-presidential debate, 2012|Vice Presidential debate]] between [[Joe Biden]] and [[Paul Ryan]]. In the sketch, [[Taran Killam]] mimicking Ryan had just [[Pseudologia fantastica|lied]] about running a 2:50 [[marathon]], a [[Four-minute mile|sub-4-minute mile]] on no training and winning the [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics  Men's 100 metres|100 metres in London]] when Bolt was introduced as his partner to confirm.

When Ryan asked Bolt "Who won the 100 metres?" the Jamaican gold-medallist answered simply. "I did." Ryan followed up by asking Bolt about his (Ryan's) finish. "You didn't finish. You weren't even there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Epstein |first=David |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/blogs/obnoxiousbostonfan/2012/10/snl_video_usain_bolt_vp_debate_biden_ryan.html |title=SNL: Bolt adds jolt to Ryan-Biden VP debate; Christina Applegate hosts   Obnoxious Boston Fan |work=Boston Globe |date=13 October 2012 |accessdate=10 November 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106231244/http://www.boston.com/sports/blogs/obnoxiousbostonfan/2012/10/snl_video_usain_bolt_vp_debate_biden_ryan.html |archivedate=6 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/vice-presidential-debate-cold-open/n27745?snl=1 SNL 2012 Vice Presidential debate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807071017/http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/vice-presidential-debate-cold-open/n27745?snl=1 |date=7 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
