By the end of April 1997, he had won three [[PGA Tour]] events in addition to his first major, the [[1997 Masters Tournament|1997 Masters]].

In 1978, Tiger putted against comedian [[Bob Hope]] in a television appearance on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''.  At age three, he shot a 48 over nine holes at the Navy course.

Woods had a much anticipated return to golf in 2009, when he performed well. His comeback included a spectacular performance at the [[2009 Presidents Cup]], but he failed to win a major, the first year since 2004 that he had not done so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dahlberg |first=Tim |title = Anything can happen: It did in Tiger's return |url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/03/01/SP691669HN.DTL |date = March 1, 2009 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate =July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ferguson |first=Doug |title=Americans win the Presidents Cup |date=October 12, 2009 |url=http://www.times-news.com/localgolf/local_story_285000117.html/resources_printstory |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120604213407/http://www.times-news.com/localgolf/local_story_285000117.html/resources_printstory |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 4, 2012 |newspaper=[[Cumberland Times-News]] |accessdate=December 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barber |first=Phil |title=Americans win the Presidents Cup |work=[[The Press Democrat]] |date=October 11, 2009 |url=http://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20091011/SPORTS/910119981/1010/SPORTS?Title=Americans-win-the-Presidents-Cup |accessdate=October 27, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003002716/http://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20091011/SPORTS/910119981/1010/SPORTS?Title=Americans-win-the-Presidents-Cup |archivedate=October 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his marital infidelities came to light and received massive media coverage at the end of 2009 (see further details below), Woods announced in December that he would be taking an indefinite break from competitive golf.&lt;ref name=legend/&gt; In February 2010, he delivered a televised apology for his behavior, saying "I was wrong and I was foolish."&lt;ref name=BBC100223/&gt; During this period, several companies ended their endorsement deals with Woods.&lt;ref name=connection/&gt;

Woods returned to competition in April at the [[2010 Masters Tournament|2010 Masters]], where he finished tied for fourth place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/masters10/news/story?id=5075606|title=Mickelson wins Masters; Tiger 5 back|date=April 11, 2010|publisher=ESPN |accessdate=April 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed the Masters with poor showings at the Quail Hollow Championship and the Players Championship, where he withdrew in the fourth round, citing injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/news/story?id=5152134|title=Woods misses sixth PGA Tour cut|date=May 1, 2010|publisher=ESPN |first=Bob|last=Harig|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly afterward, [[Hank Haney]], Woods' coach since 2003, resigned the position. In August, Woods hired [[Sean Foley (golf instructor)|Sean Foley]] as Haney's replacement.  The rest of the season went badly for Woods, who failed to win a single event for the first time since turning professional, while nevertheless finishing the season ranked No. 2 in the world.

In 2011, Woods' performance continued to suffer; this took its toll on his ranking. After falling to No. 7 in March, he rebounded to No. 5 with a strong showing at the [[2011 Masters Tournament]], where he tied for fourth place.&lt;ref&gt;pgatour.com, Official World Golf Ranking for March 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;pgatour.com, Official World Golf Ranking for April 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;pgatour.com, 2011 Masters tournament data&lt;/ref&gt; Due to leg injuries incurred at the Masters, he missed several summer stops on the PGA Tour. In July, he fired his longtime caddy [[Steve Williams (caddy)|Steve Williams]] (who was shocked by the dismissal), and replaced him on an interim basis with friend Bryon Bell.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tigerwoods.com, June 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard Sounes: ''The Wicked Game''&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to tournament play in August, Woods continued to falter, and his ranking gradually fell to a low of #58.&lt;ref name=chevron&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/7231583/tiger-woods-moves-50th-official-world-golf-rankings |title=Tiger Woods moves to 50th in rankings |date=November 13, 2011|publisher=ESPN |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rose to No. 50 in mid-November after a third-place finish at the [[Emirates Australian Open]], and broke his winless streak with a victory at December's [[Chevron World Challenge]].&lt;ref name=chevron/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;pgatour.com, December 4, 2011, ''Tiger ends two-year winless streak''&lt;/ref&gt;

Woods began his 2012 season with two tournaments (the [[Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship]] and the [[AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am]]) where he started off well, but struggled on the final rounds. Following the [[WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship]], where he was knocked out in the second round by missing a 5-foot putt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/7608618/nick-watney-ousts-tiger-woods-match-play-championship-second-round |title=Nick Watney eliminates Tiger Woods |first=Farrell |last=Evans |date=February 24, 2012 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woods revised his putting technique and tied for second at the [[Honda Classic]], with the lowest final round score in his PGA Tour career. After a short time off due to another leg injury, Woods won the [[Arnold Palmer Invitational]], his first win on the PGA Tour since the [[BMW Championship (PGA Tour)|BMW Championship]] in September 2009. Following several dismal performances, Woods notched his 73rd PGA Tour win at the [[Memorial Tournament]] in June, tying [[Jack Nicklaus]] in second place for most PGA Tour victories;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.weeklytimesofindia.com/sports-news/tiger-wins-memorial-to-match-nicklaus-on-73-wins/ |title=Tiger wins Memorial to match Nicklaus on 73 wins |newspaper=[[The Times of India]] |date=June 4, 2012 |accessdate=June 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a month later, Woods surpassed Nicklaus with a win at the [[AT&amp;T National]], to trail only [[Sam Snead]], who accumulated 82 PGA tour wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/golf/18668946 |title=Tiger Woods wins AT&amp;T to pass Jack Nicklaus record |work=BBC Sport |date=July 2, 2012 |accessdate=July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 2013 would bring a return of Woods' dominating play. In January, he won the [[Farmers Insurance Open]] by four shots for his 75th PGA Tour win. It was the seventh time he had won the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/8890930/tiger-takes-torrey-record-7th-time-farmers-insurance-open-golf |title=Tiger takes Torrey for 75th tour win |date=January 29, 2013 |first=Farrell |last=Evans |work=ESPN |accessdate=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, he won the [[WGC-Cadillac Championship]], also for the seventh time, giving him his 17th WGC title and first since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/9037944/tiger-woods-wins-wgc-cadillac-championship-76th-pga-tour-victory |title=Tiger Woods prevails at Doral |work=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |date=March 10, 2013 |accessdate=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, he won the [[Arnold Palmer Invitational]], winning the event for a record-tying 8th time. The win moved him back to the top of the world rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/9096561/tiger-woods-back-world-no-1-golf-wins-arnold-palmer-invitational |title=Tiger returns to No. 1, wins Bay Hill |work=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |date=March 25, 2013 |accessdate=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To commemorate that achievement, Nike was quick to launch an ad with the tagline "winning takes care of everything".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2013/03/27/tiger-woods-nike-ad-causes-a-stir-with-winning-takes-care-of-everything-message/ |title=Tiger Woods Nike ad causes a stir with "winning takes care of everything" message |first=Cindy |last=Boren |date=March 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013 Masters]], Woods faced disqualification after unwittingly admitting in a post-round interview with [[ESPN]] that he had taken an illegal drop on the par-5 15th hole when his third shot had bounced off the pin and into the water. After further [[Trial by television in golf tournaments|review of television footage]], Woods was assessed a two-stroke penalty for the drop but was not disqualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Is Tiger Woods facing disqualification at Masters? |url=http://www.cbssports.com/golf/blog/eye-on-golf/22059739/is-tiger-woods-facing-disqualification-at-masters |publisher=CBS Sports |accessdate=April 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished tied for fourth in the event. Woods won [[The Players Championship]] in May 2013, his second career win at the event, notching his fourth win of the 2013 season. It was the quickest he had ever gotten to four wins in any season in his professional career.

Woods had a poor showing at the [[2013 U.S. Open (golf)|2013 U.S Open]] as a result of an elbow injury sustained at [[The Players Championship]]. In finishing at 13-over-par, he recorded his worst score ever as a professional and finished 12 strokes behind winner [[Justin Rose]]. After a prolonged break because of the injury, during which he missed the [[Greenbrier Classic]] and his own [[AT&amp;T National]], he returned at the [[2013 Open Championship|Open Championship]] at [[Muirfield]]. Despite being in contention all week and beginning the final round only two strokes behind [[Lee Westwood]], he struggled with the speed of the greens and could only manage a 3-over-par 74 that left him tied for 6th place, five strokes behind eventual winner [[Phil Mickelson]]. Two weeks later, Woods returned to form at the [[2013 WGC-Bridgestone Invitational|WGC-Bridgestone Invitational]], recording his 5th win of the season and 8th win at the event in its 15-year history. His second round 61 matched his record score on the PGA Tour and could easily have been a 59 were it not for some short missed birdie putts on the closing holes. This gave him a seven stroke lead that he held onto for the rest of the tournament. Woods would never contend at the PGA Championship at Oak Hill Country Club and would come short of winning a major for the 5th full season, only contending in two of the four majors in 2013.

After a slow start to 2014, Woods injured himself during the final round of the [[Honda Classic]] and was unable to finish the tournament.  He withdrew after the 13th hole, citing back pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Tiger Woods walks off at Honda Classic |magazine=bunkered |date=March 3, 2014 |url=http://www.bunkered.co.uk/golf-news/tiger-woods-walks-off-at-honda-classic |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He subsequently competed in the [[WGC-Cadillac Championship]] but was visibly in pain during much of the last round. He was forced to skip the [[Arnold Palmer Invitational]] at the end of March 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Tiger Woods a doubt for the Masters |magazine=bunkered |date=March 19, 2014 |url=http://www.bunkered.co.uk/golf-news/tiger-woods-a-doubt-for-the-masters |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after undergoing [[microdiscectomy|back surgery]], he announced on April 1 that he would miss the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]] for the first time since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Tiger Woods out of the Masters |magazine=bunkered |date=April 1, 2014 |url=http://www.bunkered.co.uk/golf-news/tiger-woods-out-of-the-masters |accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Woods returned at the [[Quicken Loans National]] in June, however he stated that his expectations for the week were low.  He would struggle with nearly every aspect of his game and miss the cut.  He next played at [[The Open Championship]], contested at Hoylake, where Woods had won eight years prior.  Woods fired a brilliant 69 in the first round to put himself in contention, but shot 77 on Friday and would eventually finish 69th. Despite his back pain, he played at the [[2014 PGA Championship]] where he failed to make the cut. On August 25, 2014, Woods and his swing coach Sean Foley parted ways. In the four years under Foley, he won eight times but no majors. He had previously won eight majors with Harmon and six with Haney. Woods said there is currently no timetable to find a replacement swing coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2014/08/25/tiger-woods-sean-foley-coach-split/14561331/ |title=Tiger Woods splits with swing coach Sean Foley |newspaper=USA Today |date=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 5, 2015, Woods withdrew from the [[Farmers Insurance Open]] after another back injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.golf.com/tour-and-news/tiger-woods-withdraws-farmers-insurance-open |title=Tiger Withdraws From the Farmers Insurance Open With Bad Back |publisher=Golf.com |first=Gary |last=Van Sickle |date=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woods stated on his website that it was unrelated to his previous surgery and he would take a break from golf until his back healed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tigerwoods.com/news/2015/02/11/108976880/his-back-feeling-better-tiger-plans-to-work-on-his-game-and-play-again-soon/ |title=His back feeling better, Tiger plans to work on his game and play again soon |date=February 11, 2015 |publisher=tigerwoods.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned for the [[2015 Masters Tournament|Masters]], finishing in a tie for 17th.

In 2002, Woods was involved in every aspect of the launch of [[Buick]]'s [[Buick Rendezvous|Rendezvous]] [[SUV]]. A company spokesman stated that Buick was happy with the value of Woods' endorsement, pointing out that more than 130,000 Rendezvous vehicles were sold in 2002 and 2003. "That exceeded our forecasts," he was quoted as saying, "It has to be in recognition of Tiger." In February 2004, Buick renewed Woods' endorsement contract for another five years, in a deal reportedly worth $40&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="ad1" /&gt;

In February 2007, Woods, [[Roger Federer]] and [[Thierry Henry]] became ambassadors for the "[[Global Gillette|Gillette]] Champions" marketing campaign.

In 1997, Woods and golfer [[Arnold Palmer]] initiated a case against Bruce Matthews (the owner of Gotta Have It Golf, Inc.) and others in the effort to stop the unauthorized sale of their images and alleged signatures in the memorabilia market. Matthews and associated parties counterclaimed that Woods and his company, ETW Corporation, committed several acts including breach of contract, breach of implied duty of good faith, and violations of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Palmer v.

===Tiger-proofing===
Early in Woods' career, a small number of golf experts expressed concern about his impact on the competitiveness of the game and the public appeal of professional golf. Sportswriter Bill Lyon of [[Knight Ridder]] asked in a column, "Isn't Tiger Woods actually bad for golf?" (though Lyon ultimately concluded that he was not).&lt;ref name="Bad"&gt;{{cite news |title=Woods bad for golf? There's an unplayable lie |newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |last=Lyon |first=Bill |date=August 16, 2000 |accessdate=May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, some pundits feared that Woods would drive the spirit of competition out of the game of golf by making existing courses obsolete and relegating opponents to simply competing for second place each week.

A related effect was measured by [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] economist Jennifer Brown, who found that other golfers scored higher when competing against Woods than when he was not in the tournament. The scores of highly skilled (exempt) golfers are nearly one stroke higher when playing against Woods. This effect was larger when he was on winning streaks and disappeared during his well-publicized slump in 200304. Brown explains the results by noting that competitors of similar skill can hope to win by increasing their level of effort, but that, when facing a "superstar" competitor, extra exertion does not significantly raise one's level of winning while increasing risk of injury or exhaustion, leading to reduced effort.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Jennifer; [http://home.business.utah.edu/finmh/Brown_Quitters_Never_Win.pdf ''Quitters Never Win: The (Adverse) Incentive Effects of Competing with Superstars''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417030936/http://home.business.utah.edu/finmh/Brown_Quitters_Never_Win.pdf |date=April 17, 2012 }}, Job Market Paper, November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Many courses in the PGA Tour rotation (including major championship sites like [[Augusta National Golf Club|Augusta National]]) have added yardage to their tees in an effort to reduce the advantage of long hitters like Woods, a strategy that became known as "Tiger-Proofing". Woods said he welcomed the change, in that adding yardage to courses did not affect his ability to win.&lt;ref name="Open2005"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tiger Woods Press Conference:The Open Championship |publisher=TigerWoods.com |agency=ASAP Sports |date=July 12, 2005 |url=http://www.tigerwoods.com/defaultflash.sps?page=fullstorynews&amp;iNewsID=199184&amp;categoryID=&amp;pagenumber=1&amp;cat=0 |accessdate=May 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316104728/http://www.tigerwoods.com/defaultflash.sps?page=fullstorynews&amp;iNewsID=199184&amp;categoryID=&amp;pagenumber=1&amp;cat=0 |archivedate=March 16, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Woods first joined the [[PGA Tour]] in 1996, his long drives had a large impact on the world of golf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woods threatens all records at the Masters |agency=Associated Press |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20050330233215/http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamGolf97Masters/apr13_tig.html |archivedate=March 30, 2005 |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamGolf97Masters/apr12_mastersthird.html |publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]] |date=April 12, 1997 |accessdate=August 6, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/augusta/stories/041497/20Woods.html |agency=Associated Press |title=Tiger had more than just length in annihilating Augusta |work=Sports Illustrated |date=April 14, 1997 |accessdate=June 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when he did not upgrade his equipment in the following years (insisting upon the use of True Temper Dynamic Gold steel-shafted clubs and smaller steel clubheads that promoted accuracy over distance),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.golftransactions.com/equipment/truetemper070903.html |first=Cara |last=Polinski |work=The Wire |title=True Temper Wins Again! |date=July 8, 2003 |accessdate=August 6, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927163826/http://www.golftransactions.com/equipment/truetemper070903.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; many opponents caught up to him. Phil Mickelson even made a joke in 2003 about Woods using "inferior equipment", which did not sit well with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Titleist]] or Woods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/story?id=1507979 |title=Woods, Mickelson clear the air, put spat behind them |work=ESPN |date=February 13, 2003 |accessdate=August 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.golftoday.co.uk/news/yeartodate/news03/mickelson1.html |title=Phil Mickelson clarifies Tiger comments |work=Golf Today |accessdate=August 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2004, Woods finally upgraded his driver technology to a larger clubhead and [[graphite]] shaft, which, coupled with his clubhead speed, made him one of the Tour's lengthiest players off the [[Golf tee|tee]] once again.

Despite his power advantage, Woods has always focused on developing an excellent all-around game. Although in recent years{{when|date=May 2017}} he has typically been near the bottom of the Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron play is generally accurate, his recovery and bunker play is very strong, and his putting (especially under pressure) is possibly his greatest asset. He is largely responsible for a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for utilizing more hours of practice than most.&lt;ref name="linkageinc"&gt;{{cite web |title=Case Study: Tiger Woods |publisher=Linkage Incorporated |url=http://www.linkageinc.com/company/news_events/link_learn_enewsletter/archive/2002/03_02_case_study_tiger_woods.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015151438/http://www.linkageinc.com/company/news_events/link_learn_enewsletter/archive/2002/03_02_case_study_tiger_woods.aspx |archivedate=October 15, 2006 |accessdate=June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="par"&gt;{{cite web |title=When Par isn't good enough |website=APMP.org |url=http://www.apmp.org/fv-63.aspx |accessdate=May 12, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720081846/http://www.apmp.org/fv-63.aspx |archivedate=July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tiger Woods Up Close And Personal |publisher=[[CBS News]] |first=Ed |last=Bradley |date=September 3, 2006 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/03/23/60minutes/main1433767_page5.shtml |accessdate=May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From mid-1993 (while he was still an amateur) until 2004, Woods worked almost exclusively with leading swing coach [[Butch Harmon]]. From mid-1997, Harmon and Woods fashioned a major redevelopment of Woods' full swing, achieving greater consistency, better distance control, and better [[kinesiology]]. The changes began to pay off in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Pro: Lessons About Golf and Life from My Father, Claude Harmon, Sr. |last=Harmon |first=Butch |authorlink=Butch Harmon |year=2006 |publisher=Three Rivers Press |isbn=0-307-33804-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; From March 2004 to 2010, Woods was coached by [[Hank Haney]], who worked on flattening his swing plane. Woods continued to win tournaments with Haney, but his driving accuracy dropped significantly. Haney resigned in May 2010 and was replaced by [[Sean Foley (golf instructor)|Sean Foley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.tsn.ca/golf/story/?id=330104 |title=Canadian Swing Coach Foley Helping Tiger At PGA Championship |work=Canadian Press |date=August 10, 2010 |accessdate=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Cowan|Fluff Cowan]] served as Woods' [[caddie]] from the start of his professional career until Tiger fired him in March 1999.&lt;ref name="Fluff"&gt;{{cite news |title=Woods Dismisses His Caddie Cowan |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 9, 1999 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E1DA113FF93AA35750C0A96F958260 |accessdate=May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by [[Steve Williams (caddy)|Steve Williams]], who became a close friend of Woods and is often credited with helping him with key shots and putts.&lt;ref name="Caddie"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tiger's Caddie Reflects on "Defining" Moment at Medinah |work=[[Golf Channel]] |agency=Associated Press |date=August 8, 2006 |url=http://www.thegolfchannel.com/core.aspx?page=15101&amp;select=20332 |accessdate=May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, Woods fired Williams and replaced him with friend Bryon Bell on an interim basis. Joe LaCava, a former caddie of both [[Fred Couples]] and [[Dustin Johnson]], was hired by Woods shortly after&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/7019948/tiger-woods-hire-dustin-johnson-caddie-joe-lacava |title=Tiger Woods hires caddie Joe LaCava |work=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |date=September 27, 2011 |accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has remained Woods' caddie since then, but he has seen very limited work.

These projects have encountered problems that have been attributed to factors that include  overly optimistic estimates of their value, declines throughout the global economy (particularly the [[United States housing bubble|U.S. crash in home prices]]), and the decreased appeal and marketability of Woods following his 2009 infidelity scandal.&lt;ref name=sullivan/&gt;
