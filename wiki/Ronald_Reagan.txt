'''Ronald Wilson Reagan''' ({{IPAc-en||r|e||n}}; February 6, 1911  June 5, 2004) was an American politician and actor who served as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|40th President of the United States]] from 1981 to 1989.  Prior to the presidency, he was a [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]] actor and trade union leader before serving as the 33rd [[Governor of California]] from 1967 to 1975.

Reagan was raised in a poor family in small towns of northern [[Illinois]]. He graduated from [[Eureka College]] in 1932 and worked as a sports announcer on several regional radio stations. After moving to Hollywood in 1937, he became an actor and starred in a few major productions. Reagan was twice elected President of the [[Screen Actors Guild]]the labor union for actorswhere he worked to root out [[House Un-American Activities Committee|Communist influence]]. In the 1950s, he moved into television and was a motivational speaker at [[General Electric]] factories. Reagan had been a [[Democratic Party (United States)#Liberals|Democrat]] until 1962, when he became a conservative and switched to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. In [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]], Reagan's speech, "[[A Time for Choosing]]", supported [[Barry Goldwater]]'s foundering presidential campaign and earned him national attention as a new conservative spokesman. Building a network of supporters, he was [[California gubernatorial election, 1966|elected Governor of California]] in 1966. As governor, Reagan raised taxes, turned a state budget deficit to a surplus, challenged the protesters at the [[University of California]], ordered in [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] troops during a period of [[People's Park (Berkeley)|protest movements]] in 1969, and was [[California gubernatorial election, 1970|re-elected in 1970]]. He twice ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination, in [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]] and [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]]. Four years later in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]], he won the nomination, and then defeated [[incumbent]] president  [[Jimmy Carter]]. At {{age in years and days|1911|2|6|1981|1|20}} of age at the time of his [[First inauguration of Ronald Reagan|inauguration]], he became the oldest [[President-elect of the United States|president-elect]] to take the [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|oath of office]] (a distinction now held by [[Donald Trump]], since 2017). Reagan faced former vice president [[Walter Mondale]] when he ran for re-election in [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984]], and defeated him in a landslide with the largest [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral college]] victory in American history.

Soon after taking office, Reagan began implementing sweeping new political and economic initiatives. His [[supply-side economic]] policies, dubbed "[[Reaganomics]]", advocated tax rate reduction to spur economic growth, economic deregulation, and reduction in government spending. In his first term he survived an [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|assassination attempt]], spurred the [[War on Drugs]], and fought public sector labor. Over his two terms, the economy saw a reduction of inflation from 12.5% to 4.4%, and an average annual growth of [[real GDP]] of 3.4%. Reagan enacted cuts in domestic discretionary spending, cut taxes, and increased military spending contributed to increased federal outlays overall, even after adjustment for inflation. Foreign affairs dominated his second term, including ending the [[Cold War]], the [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|bombing of Libya]], and the [[IranContra affair]]. In June 1987, four years after he publicly described the Soviet Union as an "[[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]", Reagan challenged Soviet [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to "[[tear down this wall!]]", during a speech at the [[Brandenburg Gate]]. He transitioned Cold War policy from [[dtente]] to [[rollback]] by escalating an [[arms race]] with the USSR while engaging in talks with Gorbachev. The talks culminated in the [[INF Treaty]], which shrank both countries' nuclear arsenals. Reagan began his presidency during the decline of the Soviet Union, and the [[Berlin Wall]] fell just ten months after the end of his term. Germany [[German reunification|reunified]] the following year, and on December 26, 1991 (nearly three years after he left office), the [[Soviet Union collapse]]d.

When Reagan left office in 1989, he held an approval rating of sixty-eight percent, matching those of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and later [[Bill Clinton]], as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = A Look Back At The Polls|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-look-back-at-the-polls/|publisher = CBS News|accessdate = May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first president since [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to serve two full terms, after a succession of five prior presidents did not. Although he had planned an active post-presidency, Reagan disclosed in November 1994 that he had been diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]] earlier that year. Afterward, his informal public appearances became more infrequent as the disease progressed. He [[Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan|died at home]] on June 5, 2004. An icon among American [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], he is viewed favorably in [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|historical rankings of U.S. presidents]], and his tenure constituted a [[Realigning election|realignment]] toward conservative policies in the United States.

==Early life==
[[File:Ronald Reagan Boyhood Home (8030104930).jpg|thumb|left|Ronald Reagan's boyhood home in Dixon, Illinois]]
Ronald Wilson Reagan was born on February 6, 1911 in an apartment on the [[Birthplace of Ronald Reagan|second floor of a commercial building]] in [[Tampico, Illinois]]. He was the younger son of [[Nelle Wilson Reagan|Nelle Clyde]] ({{nee|Wilson}}; 18831962) and [[Jack Reagan]] (18831941).&lt;ref name=nrhp /&gt; Jack was a salesman and storyteller whose grandparents were [[Irish Catholic]] emigrants from [[County Tipperary]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Terry Golway]], ''Ronald Reagan's America'' (2008) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; while Nelle was of half [[English people|English]] and half [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent (her mother was born in [[Surrey]]).&lt;ref name="pk 4"&gt;Kengor, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan's older brother, [[Neil Reagan]] (19081996), became an advertising executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Neil Reagan, 88, Ad Executive And Jovial Brother of President|author=Lynette Holloway|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/13/us/neil-reagan-88-ad-executive-and-jovial-brother-of-president.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 13, 1996|accessdate=March 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan's father nicknamed his son "Dutch", due to his "[[Dutch Boy Paint|fat little Dutchman]]"-like appearance and "Dutchboy" haircut;&lt;ref name="RRfacts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/reference/facts.html|title=Ronald Reagan Facts|accessdate=June 9, 2007|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; the nickname stuck with him throughout his youth.&lt;ref name="RRfacts" /&gt; Reagan's family briefly lived in several towns and cities in Illinois, including [[Monmouth, Illinois|Monmouth]], [[Galesburg, Illinois|Galesburg]], and Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/3637552-418/reagan-university-president-park-building.html|title=Is Ronald Reagan's Chicago boyhood home doomed?|work=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=June 12, 2012|last=Janssen|first=Kim|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202005705/http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/3637552-418/reagan-university-president-park-building.html|archivedate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, they returned to Tampico and lived above the [[H. C. Pitney Variety Store]] until finally settling in [[Dixon, Illinois|Dixon]].&lt;ref name=nrhp&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/hargis/PDFs/201351.pdf|title= Main Street Historic District, National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form|date=April 1, 1982|agency=Illinois Historic Preservation Agency|accessdate=July 27, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807213939/http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/hargis/PDFs/201351.pdf|archivedate=August 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his election as president, Reagan resided in the upstairs White House private quarters, and he would quip that he was "living above the store again".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/06/06/reagan_all_american_dies_at_93/|title=Reagan, all-American, dies at 93|date=June 6, 2004|author=Schribman, David|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=January 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Ronald Reagan wrote that his mother "always expected to find the best in people and often did".&lt;ref name="am 22"&gt;Reagan, Ronald (1990), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; She attended the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]] church regularly and was active, and very influential, within it; she frequently led Sunday school services and gave the [[Bible]] readings to the congregation during the services. A strong believer in the power of [[prayer]], she led prayer meetings at church and was in charge of mid-week prayers when the pastor was out of town.&lt;ref&gt;Kengor, Paul (2004), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Her strong commitment to the church is what induced her son Ronald to become a [[Protestantism|Protestant Christian]] rather than a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] like his father.&lt;ref name="pk 4"/&gt; He also stated that she strongly influenced his own beliefs: "I know that she planted that faith very deeply in me."&lt;ref&gt;Kengor, paul (2004), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Ronald Reagan attended [[Eureka College]], founded by the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) in 1855.  While pursuing the degree he earned in economics-sociology in 1932, Ronald Reagan continued to be surrounded with the same faith his mother had introduced in his life.

According to [[Paul Kengor]], author of ''God and Ronald Reagan'', Reagan had a particularly strong faith in the goodness of people; this faith stemmed from the optimistic faith of his mother&lt;ref name="pk 16"&gt;Kengor, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Disciples of Christ]] faith,&lt;ref name="pk 16" /&gt; into which he was baptized in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Lewis|editor-first1=Warren|editor-last2=Rollmann|editor-first2=Hans|title=Restoring the First-century Church in the Twenty-first Century|publisher=Wipf and Stock|year=2005|isbn=1-59752-416-6|pages=181192}}&lt;/ref&gt; For that period of time, which was long before the [[African-American civil rights movement (19541968)|civil rights movement]], Reagan's opposition to [[racial discrimination]] was unusual and commendable. He recalled the time in Dixon when the proprietor of a local inn would not allow [[African Americans|black people]] to stay there, and he brought them back to his house. His mother invited them to stay overnight and have breakfast the next morning.&lt;ref&gt;Kengor, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; After the closure of the Pitney Store in 1920 and the family's move to Dixon,&lt;ref&gt;Cannon (2001), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; the midwestern "small universe" had a lasting impression on Reagan.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan (1990), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal education===
Reagan attended [[Dixon High School (Illinois)|Dixon High School]], where he developed interests in acting, sports, and storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;Brands, ''Reagan'' (2015) pp.&amp;nbsp;125&lt;/ref&gt; His first job involved working as a [[lifeguard]] at the [[Rock River (Mississippi River)|Rock River]] in Lowell Park in 1927. Over a six-year period, Reagan reportedly performed 77 rescues as a lifeguard.&lt;ref&gt;Brands, ''Reagan'' (2015) pp.&amp;nbsp;167&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Eureka College]], a Disciples-oriented liberal arts school, where he became a member of the [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity, a cheerleader, and studied economics and sociology. While involved, the [[Miller Center of Public Affairs]] described him as an "indifferent student". He majored in economics and sociology and graduated with a C grade.&lt;ref name=majoraverage&gt;{{cite news|title=Ronald Reagan: Life Before the Presidency|url=http://millercenter.org/president/biography/reagan-life-before-the-presidency|accessdate=August 30, 2015|publisher=Miller Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed a reputation as a "jack of all trades", excelling in campus politics, sports, and theater. He was a member of the [[American football|football]] team and captain of the swim team. He was elected student body president and led a student revolt against the college president after the president tried to cut back the faculty.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon (2003), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio and film===
[[File:Ronald Reagan in The Bad Man (1941).png|thumb|left|upright=0.75|''[[The Bad Man (1941 film)|The Bad Man]]'' (1941)]]
After graduating from Eureka in 1932, Reagan drove to Iowa, where he held jobs as a radio announcer at several stations. He moved to [[WHO (AM)|WHO]] radio in [[Des Moines]] as an announcer for [[Chicago Cubs]] baseball games. His specialty was creating play-by-play accounts of games using as his source only basic descriptions that the station received by wire as the games were in progress.&lt;ref&gt;Brands, ''Reagan'' (2015) pp.&amp;nbsp;2431&lt;/ref&gt;

While traveling with the Cubs in California in 1937, Reagan took a screen test that led to a seven-year contract with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] studios.&lt;ref&gt;Brands, ''Reagan'' (2015) pp.&amp;nbsp;3541&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the first few years of his Hollywood career in the "[[B movie|B film]]" unit, where, Reagan joked, the producers "didn't want them good; they wanted them Thursday".&lt;ref name="agpi" /&gt;

He earned his first screen credit with a starring role in the 1937 movie ''[[Love Is on the Air]]'', and by the end of 1939 he had already appeared in 19 films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/biography/hollywood_years.asp|title=Ronald Reagan &gt; Hollywood Years|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation|accessdate=March 28, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312120428/http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/biography/hollywood_years.asp|archivedate=March 12, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; including ''[[Dark Victory]]'' with [[Bette Davis]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]]. Before the film ''[[Santa Fe Trail (film)|Santa Fe Trail]]'' with [[Errol Flynn]] in 1940, he played the role of [[George Gipp|George "The Gipper" Gipp]] in the film ''[[Knute Rockne, All American]]''; from it, he acquired the lifelong nickname "the Gipper."&lt;ref name="Cannon15"&gt;Cannon (2001), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, exhibitors voted him the fifth most popular star from the younger generation in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article8208562|title=CUPID'S INFLUENCE ON THE FILM BOX-OFFICE.|newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 18481956)]]|location=Melbourne, Vic.|date=October 4, 1941|accessdate=April 24, 2012|page=7 Supplement: The Argus Week-end Magazine|publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan played his favorite acting role in 1942's ''[[Kings Row]]'',&lt;ref name="Rest of Me"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Reagan|first=Ronald|title=Where's the Rest of Me?|year=1965|publisher=Duell, Sloan, and Pearce|location=New York|isbn=0-283-98771-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he plays a double amputee who recites the line "Where's the rest of me?"later used as the title of his 1965 autobiography. Many film critics considered ''Kings Row'' to be his best movie,&lt;ref name="TCMarticle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=17922|title=Kings Row|accessdate=March 24, 2009|last=Wood|first=Brett|work=TCM website|publisher=Turner Classic Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the film was condemned by ''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[Bosley Crowther]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 3, 1942|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9903E2DE143BE33BBC4B53DFB4668389659EDE|title=The Screen; 'Kings Row,' With Ann Sheridan and Claude Rains, a Heavy, Rambling Film, Has Its First Showing Here at the Astor|access-date=March 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cannon (2003), pp.&amp;nbsp;5657&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Reagan called ''Kings Row'' the film that "made me a star",&lt;ref name="Friedrich"&gt;{{Cite book|last =Friedrich|first =Otto|title =City of nets: a portrait of Hollywood in the 1940s|publisher=University of California Press (reprint)|year =1997|pages =8689|url =https://books.google.com/?id=1Y9uZw7YNK8C |isbn =978-0-520-20949-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was unable to capitalize on his success because he was ordered to active duty with the U.S. Army at San Francisco two months after its release, and never regained "star" status in motion pictures.&lt;ref name="Friedrich"/&gt; In the post-war era, after being separated from almost four years of World War II stateside service with the 1st Motion Picture Unit in December 1945, Reagan co-starred in such films as ''[[The Voice of the Turtle (film)|The Voice of the Turtle]]'', ''[[John Loves Mary]]'', ''[[The Hasty Heart]]'', ''[[Bedtime for Bonzo]]'', ''[[Cattle Queen of Montana]]'', ''[[Tennessee's Partner]]'', ''[[Hellcats of the Navy]]'' (the only film in which he appears with Nancy Reagan), and the 1964 remake ''[[The Killers (1964 film)|The Killers]]'' (his final film). Throughout his film career, Reagan's mother answered much of his fan mail.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, et al. (2003), p. 836&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 1942, Reagan was ordered to active duty for the first time.

===Screen Actors Guild presidency===
[[File:Dick Powell Show Premiere Episode 1961.JPG|thumb|Guest stars for the premiere of ''[[The Dick Powell Show]]''. Reagan stands behind, far left of the photograph]]
Reagan was first elected to the Board of Directors of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG) in 1941, serving as an alternate member. After World War II, he resumed service and became third vice-president in 1946.&lt;ref name="SAG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sag.org/history/presidents/reagan.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228063556/http://www.sag.org/history/presidents/reagan.html|archivedate=December 28, 2007|title=Screen Actors Guild Presidents: Ronald Reagan|publisher=Screen Actors Guild|accessdate=November 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of [[Conflict of interest|conflict-of-interest]] bylaws in 1947 led the SAG president and six board members to resign; Reagan was nominated in a special election for the position of president and was subsequently elected.&lt;ref name="SAG" /&gt; He was chosen by the membership to serve seven additional one-year terms, from 1947 to 1952 and in 1959.&lt;ref name="SAG" /&gt; Reagan led the SAG through eventful years that were marked by labor-management disputes, the [[TaftHartley Act]], the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) hearings and the [[Hollywood blacklist]] era.&lt;ref name="SAG" /&gt;

====Secret FBI informant in Hollywood====
During the late 1940s, Reagan and his then-wife, [[Jane Wyman]], provided the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] with the names of actors within the motion picture industry whom they believed to be [[Fellow traveller#PostWorld War II U.S.|communist sympathizers]]. Though he expressed reservations, he said, "Do they expect us to constitute ourselves as a little FBI of our own and determine just who is a Commie and who isn't?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,142352,00.html|title=American Notes Hollywood|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=April 21, 2009|date=September 9, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan also testified on the subject before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]].&lt;ref name="HUAC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twcnet.edu/cschutz/history-page/Consensus/Reagan-huac-testimony.html|accessdate=December 30, 2007|title=House Un-American Activities Committee Testimony: Ronald Reagan|publisher=Tennessee Wesleyan College|date=October 23, 1947|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215050331/http://www.twcnet.edu/cschutz/history-page/Consensus/Reagan-huac-testimony.html &lt;!-- Added by H3llBot --&gt;|archivedate=December 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fervent [[anti-communism|anti-communist]], he reaffirmed his commitment to democratic principles, stating, "I never as a citizen want to see our country become urged, by either fear or resentment of this group, that we ever compromise with any of our democratic principles through that fear or resentment."&lt;ref name="HUAC" /&gt;

===Television===
Though an early critic of television, Reagan landed fewer film roles in the late 1950s and decided to join the medium.&lt;ref name="agpi" /&gt; He was hired as the host of ''[[General Electric Theater]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeSmNaKCjaw&lt;/ref&gt; a series of weekly dramas that became very popular.&lt;ref name="agpi" /&gt; His contract required him to tour [[General Electric]] (GE) plants 16 weeks out of the year, which often demanded that he give 14 speeches per day.&lt;ref name="agpi" /&gt; He earned approximately $125,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|125000|1962|re=-3}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}) in this role. The show ran for 10 seasons from 1953 to 1962, which increased Reagan's profile in American households.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe|title=Morning Joe on MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously appeared in feature films mostly in supporting roles or as a "second lead". In his final work as a professional actor, Reagan was a host and performer from 1964 to 1965 on the television series ''[[Death Valley Days]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/death-valley-days/cast/200859 |title=Death Valley Days |publisher= CBS Interactive Inc. |accessdate=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan and future wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy Davis]] appeared together on television several times, including an episode of ''General Electric Theater'' in 1958 called "A Turkey for the President."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xt-2i31DRvEC&amp;pg=PA26 Reagan, American Icon].

==Early political career==
[[File:Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan aboard a boat in California 1964.jpg|thumb|Nancy and Ronald Reagan aboard a boat in California, 1964]]
Reagan began as a Hollywood [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democrat]], and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was "a true hero" to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward M. Yager|title=Ronald Reagan's Journey: Democrat to Republican|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U2cs7IHERBwC&amp;pg=PA12|year=2006|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|pages=1215|isbn=9780742544215}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] in the 1950s, became a Republican in 1962, and emerged as a leading conservative spokesman in the [[Barry Goldwater presidential campaign, 1964|Goldwater campaign of 1964]].&lt;ref&gt;Lori Clune, "Political Ideology and Activism to 1966" in Andrew L. Johns, ed., ''A Companion to Ronald Reagan'' (2015) pp.&amp;nbsp;2239.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early political career, he joined numerous political committees with a [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] orientation, such as the [[American Veterans Committee (19432008)|American Veterans Committee]]. He fought against Republican-sponsored right-to-work legislation and supported [[Helen Gahagan Douglas]] in 1950 when she [[United States Senate election in California, 1950|was defeated for the Senate]] by [[Richard Nixon]]. It was his realization that [[Communism|Communists]] were a powerful backstage influence in those groups that led him to rally his friends against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. David Woodard|title=Ronald Reagan: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U6zL1eWMwLsC&amp;pg=PA28 |year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=28|isbn=9780313396397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At rallies, Reagan spoke frequently with a strong ideological dimension. In December 1945, he was stopped from leading an anti-nuclear rally in Hollywood by pressure from the [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros]]. studio. He would later make nuclear weapons a key point of his presidency when he specifically stated his opposition to [[mutual assured destruction]]. Reagan also built on previous efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/lecture/president-reagans-legacy-and-us-nuclear-weapons-policy |title=President Reagan's Legacy and U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy. |publisher=Heritage.org |date=July 20, 2006 |accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948 presidential election]], Reagan strongly supported [[Harry S.

Simon &amp; Schuster, 1992, p. 665. {{ISBN|0-671-45654-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1950s, his relationship with actress Nancy Davis grew,&lt;ref name="An American Life"&gt;{{cite book |last=Reagan |first=Ronald |year=1990 |title=An American Life: The Autobiography |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0671691988 |location=New York City |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |isbn=0-671-69198-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he shifted to the right when he endorsed the presidential candidacies of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (1952 and 1956) and Richard Nixon (1960).&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton (1998) pp.&amp;nbsp;2931&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan was hired by [[General Electric]] (GE) in 1954 to host the ''[[General Electric Theater]]'', a weekly TV drama series. He also traveled across the country to give motivational speeches to over 200,000 GE employees. His many speecheswhich he wrote himselfwere [[Nonpartisanism|non-partisan]] but carried a conservative, pro-business message; he was influenced by [[Lemuel Boulware]], a senior GE executive. Boulware, known for his tough stance against unions and his innovative strategies to win over workers, championed the core tenets of modern American conservatism: [[free markets]], [[Anti-communism|anticommunism]], lower taxes, and [[limited government]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas W. Evans, ''The Education of Ronald Reagan: The General Electric Years and the Untold Story of His Conversion to Conservatism'' (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Eager for a larger stage, but not allowed to enter politics by GE, he quit and formally registered as a Republican.&lt;ref&gt;Brands, ''Reagan'' (2015) p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; He often said, "I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The party left me."&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, p. 635.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the legislation that would become [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] was introduced in 1961, he created a recording for the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) warning that such legislation would mean the end of freedom in America. Reagan said that if his listeners did not write letters to prevent it, "we will awake to find that we have [[socialism]]. And if you don't do this, and if I don't do it, one of these days, you and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our children, and our children's children, what it once was like in America when men were free."&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=AYrlDlrLDSQ|title=Ronald Reagan speaks out on Socialized Medicine&amp;nbsp; Audio|link=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rapaport, June 21, 2009, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/06/18/INME187IB0.DTL How AMA 'Coffeecup' gave Reagan a boost].

Reagan gained national attention in his speeches for conservative presidential contender [[Barry Goldwater]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Brands, ''Reagan'' (2015) pp.&amp;nbsp;16&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking for Goldwater, Reagan stressed his belief in the importance of smaller government. He consolidated themes that he had developed in his talks for GE to deliver his famous speech, "[[A Time for Choosing]]":{{quote|The Founding Fathers knew a government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. So we have come to a time for choosing&amp;nbsp;...

California Republicans were impressed with Reagan's political views and charisma after his "Time for Choosing" speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://governors.library.ca.gov/33-Reagan.html|title=The Governors' Gallery&amp;nbsp; Ronald Reagan|publisher=California State Library|accessdate=March 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in late 1965 he announced his [[California gubernatorial election, 1966|campaign for Governor]] in the 1966 election.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard J.

In Reagan's campaign, he emphasized two main themes: "to send the [[welfare]] bums back to work," and, in reference to burgeoning anti-war and anti-establishment [[Free Speech Movement|student protests]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]], "to clean up the mess at Berkeley."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kahn, Jeffery|publisher=UC Berkeley News|date=June 8, 2004|title=Ronald Reagan launched political career using the Berkeley campus as a target|accessdate=March 30, 2007|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/06/08_reagan.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Reagan accomplished what both U.S. Senator [[William F. Knowland]] in 1958 and former Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] in 1962 had attempted to do: he was elected, defeating two-term governor [[Pat Brown]], and was sworn in on January 2, 1967. In his first term, he froze government hiring and approved tax hikes to balance the budget.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon (2001), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after assuming his gubernatorial term, Reagan tested the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 presidential waters]] as part of a "Stop Nixon" movement, hoping to cut into Nixon's southern support&lt;ref name="Stormy"&gt;*{{cite book|author=Fischer, Klaus|title=America in White, Black, and Gray: The Stormy 1960s|year=2006|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0-8264-1816-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sCXig_6abwkC&amp;pg=PA241 |pages=241243}}&lt;/ref&gt; and become a compromise candidate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899963,00.html|title=The New Rules of Play|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=March 8, 1968|accessdate=October 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; if neither Nixon nor second-place candidate [[Nelson Rockefeller]] received enough delegates to win on the first ballot at the [[1968 Republican National Convention|Republican convention]]. However, by the time of the convention, Nixon had 692 delegate votes, 25 more than he needed to secure the nomination, followed by Rockefeller with Reagan in third place.&lt;ref name="Stormy" /&gt;

Reagan was involved in several high-profile conflicts with the protest movements of the era, including his public criticism of university administrators for tolerating student demonstrations at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] campus. On May 15, 1969, during the [[People's Park (Berkeley)#May 15, 1969: "Bloody Thursday"|People's Park protests]] at the university's campus (the original purpose of which was to discuss the [[ArabIsraeli conflict#196773|ArabIsraeli conflict]]), Reagan sent the [[California Highway Patrol]] and other officers to quell the protests. This led to an incident that became known as "Bloody Thursday," resulting in the death of student [[James Rector (student)|James Rector]] and the blinding of carpenter Alan Blanchard.&lt;ref name="Cannon50" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904149,00.html|accessdate=December 9, 2007|date=February 16, 1970|title=Postscript to People's Park|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, 111 police officers were injured in the conflict, including one who was knifed in the chest. Reagan then called out 2,200 [[California National Guard|state National Guard]] troops to occupy the city of Berkeley for two weeks to crack down on the protesters.&lt;ref name="Cannon50"&gt;Cannon, Lou (2001), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The Guard remained in Berkeley for 17 days, camping in People's Park, and demonstrations subsided as the university removed cordoned-off fencing and placed all development plans for People's Park on hold.&lt;ref name="Cannon50" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = A Brief History of UCPD: Berkeley, History Topic: People's Park|url = http://police.berkeley.edu/about_UCPD/ucpdhistory.html|website = police.berkeley.edu|accessdate = December 9, 2015|date = August 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151210225256/http://police.berkeley.edu/about_UCPD/ucpdhistory.html|archivedate=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year after "Bloody Thursday," Reagan responded to questions about campus protest movements saying, "If it takes a bloodbath, let's get it over with. No more appeasement."&lt;ref name="Cannon295"&gt;Cannon, Lou (2003), p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] kidnapped [[Patty Hearst]] in Berkeley and demanded the distribution of food to the poor, Reagan joked to a group of political aides about a [[botulism]] outbreak contaminating the food.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan's [[botulism]] joke is variously reported as "sometimes you wonder whether there shouldn't be an outbreak of botulism" (''Sarasota Journal'', March 7, 1974, p. 15A) and "It's just too bad we can't have an epidemic of botulism" (''Los Angeles Times'', March 14, 1974, "Reagan Raps Press on Botulism Quote.")&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1967, the national debate on abortion was starting to gain traction. In the early stages of the debate, Democratic California state senator [[Anthony C. Beilenson]] introduced the "Therapeutic Abortion Act" in an effort to reduce the number of "back-room abortions" performed in California.&lt;ref name="Cannon50" /&gt; The state legislature sent the bill to Reagan's desk where, after many days of indecision, he signed it on June 14, 1967.&lt;ref name="Cannon51"&gt;Cannon (2001), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; About two million abortions would be performed as a result, mostly because of a provision in the bill allowing abortions for the well-being of the mother.&lt;ref name="Cannon51" /&gt; Reagan had been in office for only four months when he signed the bill, and later stated that had he been more experienced as governor, he would not have signed it. After he recognized what he called the "consequences" of the bill, he announced that he was [[pro-life]].&lt;ref name="Cannon51" /&gt; He maintained that position later in his political career, writing extensively about abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, Ronald.

In 1967, Reagan signed the [[Mulford Act]], which repealed a law allowing [[Open carry in the United States|public carrying]] of loaded firearms (becoming [[California Penal Code]] 12031 and 171(c)). The bill, which was named after Republican assemblyman [[Don Mulford]], garnered national attention after the [[Black Panthers]] marched bearing arms upon the [[California State Capitol]] to protest it.&lt;ref name="huey newton"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/hueypnewton/actions/actions_capitolmarch.html |title=From "A Huey P.

Despite an unsuccessful attempt to force a recall election on Reagan in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jul/13/local/me-history13 Recall Idea Got Its Start in L.A. in 1898], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', July 13, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; he was re-elected governor in 1970, defeating "Big Daddy" [[Jesse M. Unruh]]. He chose not to seek a third term in the following election cycle. One of Reagan's greatest frustrations in office was the issue of [[capital punishment]], which he strongly supported.&lt;ref name="Rest of Me" /&gt; His efforts to enforce the state's laws in this area were thwarted when the [[Supreme Court of California]] issued its ''[[People v. Anderson]]'' decision, which invalidated all death sentences issued in California before 1972, though the decision was later overturned by a constitutional amendment. The only execution during Reagan's governorship was on April 12, 1967, when [[Aaron Mitchell (murderer)|Aaron Mitchell]]'s sentence was carried out by the state in [[San Quentin]]'s gas chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Seneker, Carl J|title=Governor Reagan and Executive Clemency|journal=California Law Review|volume=55|issue=2|pages=412418|date=May 1967|doi=10.2307/3479351|jstor=3479351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Reagan was governor in 1969, he signed the Family Law Act, which was an amalgam of two bills that had been written and revised by the [[California State Legislature]] over more than two years.&lt;ref&gt;Community Property and Family Law: The Family Law Act of 1969 by Aidan R. Gough, [http://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1057&amp;context=callaw Digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; It became the first [[no-fault divorce#United States history|no-fault divorce]] legislation in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;1969 Cal. Stats. chapter 1608, p. 3313&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, no-fault divorce became Reagan's greatest [[regret]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Deace|first1=Steve|title=TOP IOWA CONSERVATIVE: Divorce Is Not The Answer to Domestic Violence|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/steve-deace-iowa-divorce-women--2013-3|accessdate=29 May 2018|publisher=Business Insider|date=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan's terms as governor helped to shape the policies he would pursue in his later political career as president. By campaigning on a platform of sending "the welfare bums back to work," he spoke out against the idea of the [[welfare state]]. He also strongly advocated the Republican ideal of less government regulation of the economy, including that of undue federal taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/7092/reagan_economic_legacy.html|title=The Reagan Economic Legacy|accessdate=August 22, 2007|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|date=June 9, 2004|author=Kubarych, Roger M|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731075753/http://www.cfr.org/publication/7092/reagan_economic_legacy.html|archivedate=July 31, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan did not seek re-election to a third term as governor in 1974; he was succeeded by the [[Secretary of State of California|Secretary of State]], Democrat [[Jerry Brown]], who took office on January 6, 1975.

==1976 presidential campaign==

{{See also|Electoral history of Ronald Reagan#1976 presidential election}}
[[File:1976 Republican National Convention.jpg|thumb|left|On the podium with [[Gerald Ford]] after narrowly losing the nomination at the [[1976 Republican National Convention]]]]
In 1976, Reagan challenged incumbent President [[Gerald Ford]] in a bid to become the Republican Party's candidate for president. Reagan soon established himself as the conservative candidate with the support of like-minded organizations such as the [[American Conservative Union]], which became key components of his political base, while Ford was considered a more moderate Republican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/gf38.html|title=Biography of Gerald R. Ford|publisher=The White House|accessdate=March 29, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070411050922/http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/gf38.html|archivedate=April 11, 2007}} Ford considered himself as "a moderate in domestic affairs, a conservative in fiscal affairs, and a dyed-in-the-wool internationalist in foreign affairs."&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan's campaign relied on a strategy crafted by campaign manager [[John Sears (political strategist)|John Sears]] of winning a few primaries early to damage the inevitability of Ford's likely nomination. Reagan won North Carolina, Texas, and California, but the strategy failed, as&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=September 24, 1979|accessdate=May 10, 2008|title=Candidate Reagan is Born Again|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947391-2,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; he ended up losing New Hampshire, Florida, and his native Illinois.&lt;ref name="1976 Results"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicallibrary.org/TallState/1976rep.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006023552/http://www.politicallibrary.org/TallState/1976rep.html|archivedate=October 6, 2006|title=1976 New Hampshire presidential Primary, February 24, 1976 Republican Results|publisher=New Hampshire Political Library|accessdate=November 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Texas campaign lent renewed hope to Reagan, when he swept all 96 delegates chosen in the May 1 primary, with four more awaiting at the state convention. Much of the credit for that victory came from the work of three co-chairmen, including [[Ernest Angelo]], the mayor of [[Midland, Texas|Midland]], and [[Ray Barnhart]] of [[Houston]], whom Reagan as President would appoint in 1981 as director of the [[Federal Highway Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hathorn Billy|year =2010|title =Mayor Ernest Angelo Jr., of Midland and the 960 Reagan Sweep of Texas, May 1, 1976|journal=[[West Texas Historical Association]] Yearbook|volume =86|pages =7791 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as the [[1976 Republican National Convention|GOP convention]] neared, Ford appeared close to victory. Acknowledging his party's moderate wing, Reagan chose moderate Senator [[Richard Schweiker]] of Pennsylvania as his [[running mate]] if nominated. Nonetheless, Ford prevailed with 1,187 delegates to Reagan's 1,070.&lt;ref name="1976 Results" /&gt; Ford would go on to lose the [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976 presidential election]] to the Democratic nominee, [[Jimmy Carter]].

Reagan's concession speech emphasized the dangers of nuclear war and the threat posed by the Soviet Union. Though he lost the nomination, he received 307 write-in votes in New Hampshire, 388 votes as an Independent on Wyoming's ballot, and a single electoral vote from a [[faithless elector]] in the November election from the state of Washington,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/scores.html#1976|title=Electoral College Box Scores 17891996|accessdate=April 30, 2007|publisher=U.S. National Archives and Records Admin.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Ford had won over Democratic challenger [[Jimmy Carter]].

After the campaign, Reagan remained in the public debate with the Ronald Reagan Radio Commentary series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf7c6005hf/|title=Register of the Ronald Reagan Radio Commentary Sound Recordings, 19671980|accessdate=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his political action committee, [[Citizens for the Republic]], which was later revived in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], in 2009 by the Reagan biographer [[Craig Shirley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cftr.org/about/default.aspx|title=Citizens for the Republic: Who We Are|publisher=cftr.org|accessdate=September 19, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055243/http://www.cftr.org/about/default.aspx|archivedate=September 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980 presidential election featured Reagan against incumbent President [[Jimmy Carter]] and was conducted amid a multitude of domestic concerns as well as the ongoing [[Iran hostage crisis]].

Reagan launched his campaign by declaring "I believe in states' rights." After receiving the Republican nomination, Reagan selected one of his opponents in the primaries, [[George H. W. Bush]], to be his running mate. His relaxed and confident appearance during the televised Reagan-Carter debate on October 28, boosted his popularity, and helped to widen his lead in the polls.&lt;ref name=RR-C&amp;E&gt;{{cite web| url=https://millercenter.org/president/reagan/campaigns-and-elections| title=Ronald Reagan: Campaigns and Elections| last=Cannon| first=Lou| publisher=Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia| accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 4, Reagan won a decisive victory over Carter, carrying 44 states and receiving 489 electoral votes, to Carter's 49 electoral votes from six states plus the District of Columbia. He won the popular vote by a more modest margin, receiving 50.7% to Carter's 41.0%, with independent [[John B.

During Reagan's presidency, a program was initiated within the [[United States Intelligence Community]] to ensure America's economic strength. The program, [[Project Socrates]], developed and demonstrated the means required for the United States to generate and lead the next evolutionary leap in technology acquisition and utilization for a competitive advantageautomated innovation. To ensure that the United States acquired the maximum benefit from automated innovation, Reagan, during his second term, had an executive order drafted to create a new federal agency to implement the Project Socrates results on a nationwide basis. However, Reagan's term came to end before the executive order could be coordinated and signed, and the incoming Bush administration, labeling Project Socrates as "industrial policy," had it terminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first =Gene|last =Koprowski|title =Tech Intelligence Revival?

Reagan accepted the Republican nomination in [[Dallas, Texas]]. He proclaimed that it was "[[Morning in America|morning again in America]]," regarding the recovering economy and the dominating performance by the U.S. athletes at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], among other things.&lt;ref name="agpi" /&gt; He became the first president to open an Olympic Games held in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sok.se/inenglish/losangeles1984.4.18ea16851076df63622800011008.html|title=Los Angeles 1984|publisher=Swedish Olympic Committee|accessdate=March 7, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230123107/http://www.sok.se/inenglish/losangeles1984.4.18ea16851076df63622800011008.html|archivedate=December 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan's opponent in the 1984 presidential election was former Vice President [[Walter Mondale]]. With questions about Reagan's age, and a weak performance in the first presidential debate, his ability to perform the duties of president for another term was questioned. His apparent confused and forgetful behavior was evident to his supporters; they had previously known him clever and witty. Rumors began to circulate that he had [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/flashback/editors200410040912.asp|title=The Debate: Mondale vs. Reagan|work=National Review|date=October 4, 2004|accessdate=May 25, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416191912/http://www.nationalreview.com/flashback/editors200410040912.asp &lt;!-- Added by H3llBot --&gt;|archivedate=April 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/debatingourdestiny/newshour/84_1stprez-analysis.html|title=Reaction to first Mondale/Reagan debate|publisher=PBS|date=October 8, 1984|accessdate=December 31, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125155140/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/debatingourdestiny/newshour/84_1stprez-analysis.html|archivedate=January 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan rebounded in the second debate, and confronted questions about his age, quipping, "I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience," which generated applause and laughter, even from Mondale himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cgi.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/debates/history/1984/|title=1984 Presidential Debates|publisher=CNN|accessdate=May 25, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308065739/http://cgi.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/debates/history/1984/|archivedate=March 8, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That November, Reagan won a landslide re-election victory, carrying 49 of the 50 states, while Mondale won only Minnesota, his home state, and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name=RR-C&amp;E/&gt; Reagan won 525 of the 538 electoral votes, the most of any presidential candidate in U.S. history,&lt;ref name="pres"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/reference/pressketch.html|title=The Reagan Presidency|accessdate=April 19, 2008|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also received 58.8% of the popular vote to Mondale's 40.6%.

===Second term===

Reagan was sworn in as president for the second time on January 20, 1985, in a private ceremony at the [[White House]]. To date, at 73 years of age, he is the oldest person to take the presidential oath of office. Because January 20 fell on a Sunday, a public celebration was not held but took place in the [[Capitol rotunda]] the following day. January 21 was one of the [[Winter 1985 cold wave|coldest days on record]] in Washington, D.C.; due to poor weather, inaugural celebrations were held inside the Capitol. In the weeks that followed, he shook up his staff somewhat, moving [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[James Baker]] to Secretary of the Treasury and naming Treasury Secretary [[Donald Regan]], a former [[Merrill Lynch]] officer, Chief of Staff.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/05/us/briefing-186924.html|title=Phil Gailey and Warren Weaver Jr., "Briefing"|work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=January 27, 2011|date=June 5, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;

[[File:Reagan Space Shuttle Challenger Speech.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=15|right|Reagan addresses the nation after the Challenger disaster]]
The disintegration of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger]] on January 28, 1986, proved a pivotal moment in Reagan's presidency. All seven [[astronaut]]s aboard were killed.&lt;ref name="npr-shuttle"&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=NPR|title=Challenger: Reporting a Disaster's Cold, Hard Facts|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5175151|author=Berkes, Howard|accessdate=April 19, 2008|date=January 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of the disaster, Reagan delivered a speech, written by [[Peggy Noonan]], in which he said:{{quote|The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave&amp;nbsp;...

In 1988, near the end of the [[IranIraq War]], the U.S. Navy guided missile cruiser {{USS|Vincennes|CG-49|6}} accidentally shot down [[Iran Air Flight 655]] killing 290 civilian passengers. The incident further worsened already tense [[IranUnited States relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/war_stories/2014/07/the_vincennes_downing_of_iran_air_flight_655_the_united_states_tried_to.html |title=America's Flight 17|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1985 placing of wreath at cemetery in Bitburg, Germany====

In February 1985, the administration accepted an invitation for Reagan to visit a German military cemetery in [[Bitburg]] and to place a wreath alongside West German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]].  Deputy Chief of Staff [[Michael Deaver]] was given assurances by a German head of protocol that no war criminals were buried there.  It was later determined that the cemetery held the graves of 49 members of the [[Waffen-SS]].  What neither Deaver nor other administration officials initially realized was that many Germans drew a distinction between the regular SS, who typically were composed of Nazi true believers, and the Waffen-SS which were attached to military units and composed of conscripted soldiers.&lt;ref name="President Reagan, Lou Cannon book, 1985 Bitburg visit"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=I5Yoz3dWP28C&amp;pg=PA508&amp;lpg=PA508&amp;dq=%22Neither+Reagan+nor+Deaver+nor+anyone+else+in+the+White+House+involved+with+the+president's+participation+in+the+Bitburg+ceremony+realized+that+many+Germans+distinguished+%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fyzgn6XUyQ&amp;sig=C4G1Gxnm9cnXiI1LMU6IRfUCHPc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj89drIx63ZAhWNvlMKHatSAnQQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Neither%20Reagan%20nor%20Deaver%20nor%20anyone%20else%20in%20the%20White%20House%20involved%20with%20the%20president's%20participation%20in%20the%20Bitburg%20ceremony%20realized%20that%20many%20Germans%20distinguished%20%22&amp;f=false President Reagan: The Role Of A Lifetime], Lou Cannon, 1991, pages 507-08.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the controversy brewed in April 1985, Reagan issued a statement that called the Nazi soldiers buried in that cemetery as themselves "victims," a designation which ignited a stir over whether Reagan had equated the SS men to victims of [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1985-04-19/news/mn-14900_1_concentration-camp Reagan Defends Cemetery Visit : Says German Dead Are Also Victims of Nazis], ''Los Angeles Times'', Don Shannon, April 19, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pat Buchanan]], Reagan's Director of Communications, argued that the president did not equate the SS members with the actual Holocaust, but as victims of the ideology of Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Buchanan, Pat|authorlink =Pat Buchanan|url=http://www.buchanan.org/pma-99-1105-wallstjl.html|title=Pat Buchanan's Response to Norman Podhoretz's OP-ED|publisher=The Internet Brigade|year=1999|accessdate=September 3, 2007|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070927193354/http://www.buchanan.org/pma-99-1105-wallstjl.html|archivedate =September 27, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now strongly urged to cancel the visit,&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; the president responded that it would be wrong to back down on a promise he had made to Chancellor Kohl.  On May 5, 1985, President Reagan and Chancellor Kohl visited first visited the site of the former Nazi Bergen-Belsen concentration camp and then the Bitburg cemetery where, along with two military generals, they did place a wreath.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/06/international/europe/06REAG.html?pagewanted=all Reagan Joins Kohl in Brief Memorial at Bitburg Graves], ''New York Times'', Bernard Weinraub, May 6, 1985,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

====War on Drugs====
{{Main article|War on Drugs}}
Reagan announced a [[War on Drugs]] in 1982, in response to concerns about the increasing [[crack epidemic]]. Though Nixon had previously declared a war on drugs, Reagan advocated more militant policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alexander|first=Michelle|title=[[The New Jim Crow]]|year=2010|publisher= The New Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59558-103-7|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He said that "drugs were menacing our society" and promised to fight for drug-free schools and workplaces, expanded drug treatment, stronger law enforcement and drug interdiction efforts, and greater public awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lamar |first=Jacob V., Jr|title=Rolling Out the Big Guns|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=September 22, 1986|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,962371-1,00.html|accessdate=August 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.udayton.edu/race/03justice/crime09.htm|title=The Drug War as Race War|accessdate=April 11, 2007|author=Randall, Vernellia R.|date=April 18, 2006|publisher=The University of Dayton School of Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Reagan signed a drug enforcement bill that budgeted $1.7&amp;nbsp;billion to fund the War on Drugs and specified a mandatory minimum penalty for drug offenses.&lt;ref name="PBS Frontline"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/cron/|title=Thirty Years of America's Drug War|accessdate=April 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was criticized for promoting significant [[Race and the War on Drugs|racial disparities in the prison population]]&lt;ref name="PBS Frontline" /&gt; and critics also charged that the policies did little to reduce the availability of drugs on the street, while resulting in a great financial burden for America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle-old/341/reagan.shtml|publisher=Drug Reform Coordination Network|title=The Reagan-Era Drug War Legacy|date=June 11, 2004|accessdate=April 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defenders of the effort point to success in reducing rates of adolescent drug use:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nida.nih.gov/Infofacts/HSYouthtrends.html|title=NIDA InfoFacts: High School and Youth Trends|publisher=National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIH|accessdate=April 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; marijuana use among high-school seniors declined from 33% in 1980 to 12% in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/interviews/kleber.html|title=Interview: Dr. Herbert Kleber|accessdate=June 12, 2007|publisher=PBS|quote=The politics of the Reagan years and the Bush years probably made it somewhat harder to get treatment expanded, but at the same time, it probably had a good effect in terms of decreasing initiation and use.

Nancy Reagan traveled to 65 cities in 33 states, raising awareness about the dangers of drugs including alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4297405/|title=The 'just say no' first lady|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=February 18, 2004|accessdate=June 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Response to AIDS epidemic====
According to AIDS activist organizations such as [[ACT UP]], the Reagan administration largely ignored the [[HIV/AIDS in the United States|AIDS crisis]], which began to unfold in the United States in 1981, the same year Reagan took office. They also claim AIDS research was chronically underfunded during Reagan's administration, and requests for more funding by doctors at the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) were routinely denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/news/7046/rewriting-the-script-on-reagan-why-the-president|title=Rewriting the Script on Reagan: Why the President Ignored AIDS|author=Bronski, Michael|accessdate=March 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v3kgvUsV9tcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=and%20the%20band%20played%20on&amp;pg=PA214#v=onepage&amp;q=%22In%20the%20first%20twelve%20months%20of%20the%20epidemic%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20CDC%20had%20spent%20$1%20million%20on%20the%20outbreak,%20compared%20with%20$9%20million%20on%20Legionnaire%E2%80%99s%20disease.%22%20%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20Reagan%20administration%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9Copposed%20the%20supplemental%20appropriation%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false|title=And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic|author= Shilts, Randy|publisher= Macmillan|accessdate=March 12, 2016|isbn=9781429930390|date=2007-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time President Reagan had given his first prepared speech on the epidemic, some six years into his presidency, 36,058 Americans had been diagnosed with AIDS and 20,849 had died of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v3kgvUsV9tcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=and%20the%20band%20played%20on&amp;pg=PA596#v=snippet&amp;q=%E2%80%9Cfor%20all%20those%20years%20that%20Reagan%20had%20ignored%20it.%22%20%22By%20the%20time%20President%20Reagan%20had%20delivered%20his%20first%20speech%20on%20the%20epidemic%22%20%20%22six%20years%22%2036,058%2020,849&amp;f=false|title=And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic|author= Shilts, Randy|publisher= Macmillan|accessdate=March 12, 2016|isbn=9781429930390|date=2007-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1989, the year Reagan left office, 115,786 people had been diagnosed with AIDS in the United States, and more than 70,000 of them had died of it. 

Others however point out that federal funding for AIDS-related programs was $2.3 billion in 1989 and nearly $6 billion total over his presidency. In a September 1985 press conference Reagan said: "this is a top priority with us...there's no question about the seriousness of this and the need to find an answer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://igfculturewatch.com/2004/06/24/reagan-and-aids-a-reassessment/ |title=Reagan and AIDS: A Reassessment - IGF Culture Watch |work=IGF Culture Watch |accessdate=January 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary Bauer]], who was Reagan's domestic policy adviser near the end of his second term, similarly argued that Reagan's belief in [[cabinet government]] led him to assign the job of speaking out against AIDS to his Surgeon General and Secretary of Health and Human Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/09/us/40th-president-opponents-critics-see-reagan-legacy-tainted-aids-civil-rights.html |title=THE 40TH PRESIDENT: THE OPPONENTS; Critics See a Reagan Legacy Tainted by AIDS, Civil Rights and Union Policies |last=Toner |first=Robin |date=2004-06-09 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-04-09 |last2=Pear |first2=Robert |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Libya bombing====
{{Main article|1986 United States bombing of Libya}}
[[File:Reagan - Thatcher c8575-32A.jpg|thumb|right|British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] (here with Reagan outside [[10 Downing Street]] in June 1982, as the [[Falklands War]] drew to a close) granted the U.S. use of British airbases to launch the Libya attack]]
Relations between Libya and the United States under President Reagan were continually contentious, beginning with the [[Gulf of Sidra incident (1981)|Gulf of Sidra incident]] in 1981; by 1982, Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] was considered by the CIA to be, along with USSR leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and Cuban leader [[Fidel Castro]], part of a group known as the "unholy trinity" and was also labeled as "our international public enemy number one" by a CIA official.&lt;ref name=iokp;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,925697,00.htm | title= Libya: Fury in the Isolation Ward|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=August 23, 1982|accessdate=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tensions were later revived in early April 1986, when [[1986 Berlin discotheque bombing|a bomb exploded in a Berlin discothque]], resulting in the injury of 63 American military personnel and death of one serviceman. Stating that there was "irrefutable proof" that Libya had directed the "terrorist bombing," Reagan authorized the use of force against the country. In the late evening of April 15, 1986, the United States launched a series of [[airstrike]]s on ground targets in Libya.&lt;ref name="gs-libya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/el_dorado_canyon.htm|title=Operation El Dorado Canyon|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|date=April 25, 2005|accessdate=April 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="4-15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/15/newsid_3975000/3975455.stm|title=1986:US Launches air-strike on Libya|accessdate=April 19, 2008|date=April 15, 2008|publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain's prime minister, [[Margaret Thatcher]], allowed the U.S. Air Force to use Britain's air bases to launch the attack, on the justification that the UK was supporting America's right to self-defense under Article 51 of the [[United Nations Charter]].&lt;ref name="4-15" /&gt; The attack was designed to halt Gaddafi's "ability to export terrorism," offering him "incentives and reasons to alter his criminal behavior."&lt;ref name="gs-libya" /&gt; The president addressed the nation from the [[Oval Office]] after the attacks had commenced, stating, "When our citizens are attacked or abused anywhere in the world on the direct orders of hostile regimes, we will respond so long as I'm in this office."&lt;ref name="4-15" /&gt; The attack was condemned by many countries. By a vote of 79 in favor to 28 against with 33 abstentions, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted resolution 41/38 which "condemns the military attack perpetrated against the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya on April 15, 1986, which constitutes a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/41/a41r038.htm |title=A/RES/41/38 November 20, 1986 |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Immigration====
Reagan signed the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986|Immigration Reform and Control Act]] in 1986. The act made it illegal to knowingly hire or recruit [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]], required employers to attest to their employees' immigration status, and granted [[amnesty]] to approximately three million illegal immigrants who entered the United States before January 1, 1982, and had lived in the country continuously. Critics argue that the employer sanctions were without teeth and failed to stem illegal immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Graham, Otis|date=January 27, 2003|url=http://www.otisgraham.com/otis_graham_writings/art_ronald_reagans_big_mistake.html|title=Ronald Reagan's Big Mistake|work=The American Conservative|accessdate=August 15, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070729030751/http://www.otisgraham.com/otis_graham_writings/art_ronald_reagans_big_mistake.html|archivedate=July 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon signing the act at a ceremony held beside the newly refurbished [[Statue of Liberty]], Reagan said, "The legalization provisions in this act will go far to improve the lives of a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows, without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society. Very soon many of these men and women will be able to step into the sunlight and, ultimately, if they choose, they may become Americans."&lt;ref name="immigration"&gt;Reagan, Ronald.

In 1986, the IranContra affair became a problem for the administration stemming from the use of proceeds from covert arms sales to Iran during the [[IranIraq War]] to fund the [[Contras|Contra]] rebels [[Nicaraguan Revolution#Contra War|fighting against the government in Nicaragua]], which had been specifically outlawed by an act of Congress.&lt;ref name="I-C"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Research/Understanding_the_Iran_Contra_Affair|title=Understanding the IranContra Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/reagan.years/whitehouse/iran.html|title=The Iran Contra scandal|year=2001|accessdate=August 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The affair became a [[List of federal political scandals in the United States|political scandal]] in the United States during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Parry, Robert|authorlink=Robert Parry (journalist)|title=NYT's apologies miss the point|publisher=Consortium for Independent Journalism|date=June 2, 2004|url=http://www.consortiumnews.com/2004/060204.html|accessdate=April 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Court of Justice]], whose jurisdiction to decide the case was disputed by the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Morrison, Fred L. |title=Legal Issues in The Nicaragua Opinion |journal=American Journal of International Law |date=January 1, 1987 |volume=81 |pages=160166 |url=|doi=10.2307/2202146 |issn=0002-9300 |issue=1 |first=F.

President Reagan professed that he was unaware of the plot's existence. He opened his own investigation and appointed two Republicans and one Democrat, [[John Tower]], [[Brent Scowcroft]] and [[Edmund Muskie]], respectively, to investigate the scandal. The commission could not find direct evidence that Reagan had prior knowledge of the program, but criticized him heavily for his disengagement from managing his staff, making the diversion of funds possible.&lt;ref name="mixed WH"&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/213195.stm|title=Reagan's mixed White House legacy|accessdate=August 19, 2007|date=June 6, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate report by Congress concluded that "If the president did not know what his national security advisers were doing, he should have."&lt;ref name="mixed WH" /&gt; Reagan's popularity declined from 67% to 46% in less than a week, the greatest and quickest decline ever for a president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Jane Mayer|last1=Mayer|first1=Jane|authorlink2=Doyle McManus|last2=McManus|first2=Doyle|date=1988|title=Landslide: The Unmaking of The President, 19841988|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|isbn=978-0-395-45185-4|pages=292, 437}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal resulted in fourteen indictments within Reagan's staff, and eleven convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Dwyer|first=Paula|work=Business Week|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1997/25/b353254.htm|title=Pointing a Finger at Reagan|date=June 23, 1997|accessdate=August 23, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807235718/http://businessweek.com/1997/25/b353254.htm|archivedate=August 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the early 1980s, the United States had relied on the qualitative superiority of its weapons to essentially frighten the Soviets, but the gap had been narrowed.&lt;ref name="us-ussr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/RussiaandEurasia/EM27.cfm|title=New Evidence of Moscow's Military Threat|accessdate=May 13, 2007|last=Hamm|first=Manfred R.|date=June 23, 1983|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011205953/http://heritage.org/Research/RussiaandEurasia/EM27.cfm|archivedate=October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Soviet Union did not accelerate military spending after President Reagan's military buildup,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/politics/foreign/reagrus.htm|title=Reagan and the Russians|date=February 1994|work=The Atlantic|last1=Lebow |first1=Richard Ned |last2=Stein |first2=Janice Gross |lastauthoramp=yes |accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; their large military expenses, in combination with [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivized agriculture]] and inefficient [[planned economy|planned manufacturing]], were a heavy burden for the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet economy]].  At the same time, oil prices in 1985 fell to one-third of the previous level; oil was the main source of Soviet export revenues.  These factors contributed to a stagnant Soviet economy during [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]]'s tenure.&lt;ref name="Gaidar"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaidar|first=Yegor|title=Collapse of an Empire: Lessons for Modern Russia|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|year=2007|pages=190205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan was deeply committed first to the abolition of nuclear weapons, worldwide. Second, he was committed (thanks to his California friend [[Edward Teller]], The father of the hydrogen bomb) to building a defense against  nuclear weapons, called the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI, but everyone nicknamed it "Star Wars.") American scientists were not sure that SDI would work, but they were sure it would cost in the trillions of dollars. Reagan reassured Congressman: think of it as billions of new dollars spent in your district. If SDI worked, the Soviet nuclear armed missiles, thousands of them, would be worthless--they would all be shot down.  Gorbachev made it his highest priority to get Reagan to abandon SDI. 

Meanwhile Reagan escalated the rhetoric. In his famous 1983 speech to religious fundamentalists he outlined his strategy for  victory. First, he labeled the Soviet system an "[[Evil Empire speech|Evil empire]]" and a failure--its demise would be a godsend for the world. Second, Reagan explained his strategy was an arms buildup that would leave the Soviets far behind, with no choice but to negotiate arms reduction. Finally, displaying his  characteristic optimism, he he praised liberal democracy and promised that such a system eventually would triumph over Soviet communism.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Rowland and John M. Jones, "Reagan's Strategy for the Cold War and the Evil Empire Address."

Reagan appreciated the revolutionary change in the direction of the Soviet policy with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], and shifted to diplomacy, with a view to encourage the Soviet leader to pursue substantial arms agreements.&lt;ref name="Knopf" /&gt;  He and Gorbachev held [[List of Soviet UnionUnited States summits#Cold War (19851991)|four summit conferences]] between 1985 and 1988: the [[Geneva Summit (1985)|first]] in [[Geneva, Switzerland]], the [[Reykjavk Summit|second]] in [[Reykjavk, Iceland]], the third in Washington, D.C., and the fourth in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Atwood Lawrence,  "The Era of Epic Summitry." ''Reviews in American History'' 36.4 (2008): 616-623. [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/255737/summary online]&lt;/ref&gt;  Reagan believed that if he could persuade the Soviets to allow for more democracy and free speech, this would lead to reform and the end of Communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1982reagan1.html|title=Modern History Sourcebook: Ronald Reagan: Evil Empire Speech, June 8, 1982|accessdate=November 15, 2007|publisher=Fordham University|date=May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critical summit was at Reykjavk in October 1986, where they met alone, with translators but with no aides.  To the astonishment of the world, and the discussed of Reagan's most conservative supporters, they agree to abolish all nuclear weapons. Gorbachev then asked the end of SDI. Reagan said no, it was defensive only, and he would share the secrets with the Soviets. No deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Lewis Gaddis|title=The Cold War: A New History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=62VjS6A6-q0C&amp;pg=PA31|year=2006|page=31|isbn=9781440684500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ReaganBerlinWall.jpg|thumb|Challenging Gorbachev to "[[tear down this wall!]]" at the [[Brandenburg Gate]] (June 12, 1987)]]
Speaking at the [[Berlin Wall]] on June 12, 1987, Reagan challenged Gorbachev to go further, saying "General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization, come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, [[tear down this wall!|tear down this wall]]!"

At Gorbachev's visit to Washington in 1987, he and Reagan signed the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]] (INF Treaty) at the White House, which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/www/global/arms/treaties/inf1.html#treaty|title=INF Treaty|accessdate=May 28, 2007|publisher=US State Department}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two leaders laid the framework for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or [[START I]]; Reagan insisted that the name of the treaty be changed from Strategic Arms Limitation Talks to Strategic Arms Reduction Talks.&lt;ref name=legacy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/Lecture/President-Reagans-Legacy-and-US-Nuclear-Weapons-Policy|title=President Reagan's Legacy and U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy|last=Lettow|first=Paul|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|date=July 20, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411222123/http://www.heritage.org/Research/Lecture/President-Reagans-Legacy-and-US-Nuclear-Weapons-Policy|archivedate=April 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Reagan visited Moscow for the fourth summit in 1988, he was viewed as a celebrity by the Soviets. A journalist asked the president if he still considered the Soviet Union the evil empire. "No," he replied, "I was talking about another time, another era."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Talbott|first=Strobe|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=August 5, 1991|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973554-5,00.html|title=The Summit Goodfellas|accessdate=January 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Gorbachev's request, Reagan gave a speech on free markets at the [[Moscow State University]].&lt;ref&gt;Reagan (1990), p. 713&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in his presidency, Reagan started wearing a custom-made, technologically advanced [[hearing aid]], first in his right ear&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=June 13, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Reagan Begins to Wear a Hearing Aid in Public|author=Weisman, Steven R.|date=September 8, 1983|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/08/us/reagan-begins-to-wear-a-hearing-aid-in-public.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in his left ear as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|agency=United Press International|accessdate=June 13, 2008|date=March 21, 1985|title=Reagan Begins Using A Second Hearing Aid|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/21/us/reagan-begins-using-a-second-hearing-aid.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; His decision to go public in 1983 regarding his wearing the small, audio-amplifying device boosted their sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-08-09-austin-hearing-aid_x.htm|title=He amplifies hearing aids|accessdate=June 13, 2008|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Friess, Steve|date=August 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 13, 1985, Reagan underwent surgery at [[Bethesda Naval Hospital]] to remove cancerous [[Polyp (medicine)|polyps]] from his [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]]. He relinquished presidential power to the Vice President for eight hours in a similar procedure as outlined in the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]], which he specifically avoided invoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hnn.us/articles/812.html|title=What is the 25th Amendment and When Has It Been Invoked?|publisher=History News Network|accessdate=June 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surgery lasted just under three hours and was successful.&lt;ref&gt;Bumgarner, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan resumed the powers of the presidency later that day.&lt;ref&gt;Bumgarner, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; In August of that year, he underwent an operation to remove skin cancer cells from his nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/02/us/irritated-skin-is-removed-from-side-of-reagan-s-nose.html|title='Irritated Skin' is Removed from Side of Reagan's Nose|accessdate=June 13, 2008|author=Boyd, Gerald M|date=August 2, 1985|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, more skin cancer cells were detected on his nose and removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/13/weekinreview/balancing-the-budget-and-politics-more-cancer-on-reagan-s-nose.html|title=Balancing the Budget and Politics; More Cancer on Reagan's Nose|accessdate=June 13, 2008|date=October 13, 1987|author1=Herron, Caroline Rand  |author2=Michael Wright |lastauthoramp=yes |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1987, Reagan underwent surgery for an enlarged [[prostate]] that caused further worries about his health.

On January 7, 1989, Reagan underwent surgery at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] to repair a [[Dupuytren's contracture]] of the ring finger of his left hand. The surgery lasted for more than three hours and was performed under regional anesthesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement by Assistant to the President for Press Relations Fitzwater on the President's Hand Surgery|url=https://reaganlibrary.archives.gov/archives/speeches/1989/010789b.htm|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Library|accessdate=June 14, 2016|date=January 7, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure was done just thirteen days before he left office. For this reason, he had a hand and finger bandage the day of his farewell speech and the day of the [[inauguration of George H. W. Bush]].

===Judiciary===
{{Main article|Ronald Reagan Supreme Court candidates|List of federal judges appointed by Ronald Reagan}}
During his 1980 campaign, Reagan pledged that he would appoint the first female Supreme Court Justice if given the opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan (1990), p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; That opportunity came in his first year in office when he nominated [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice [[Potter Stewart]]. In his second term, Reagan elevated [[William Rehnquist]] to succeed [[Warren E. Burger]] as [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]], and named [[Antonin Scalia]] to fill the vacant seat. Reagan nominated conservative jurist [[Robert Bork]] to the high court in 1987. Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], a Democrat of Massachusetts, strongly condemned Bork, and great controversy ensued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Washington; Kennedy And Bork|accessdate=April 28, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/opinion/washington-kennedy-and-bork.html|author=Reston, James|date=July 5, 1987|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bork's nomination was rejected 5842.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Greenhouse, Linda|title=Bork's Nomination Is Rejected, 5842; Reagan 'Saddened'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/24/us/bork-s-nomination-is-rejected-58-42-reagan-saddened.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 24, 1987|accessdate=November 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan then nominated [[Douglas H.

Reagan also nominated [[Vaughn Walker]]who would later be revealed to be the earliest known gay federal judge&lt;ref name=reuters_20110406&gt;{{cite news|first=Dan|last=Levine|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/06/us-gaymarriage-judge-idUSTRE7356TA20110406|agency=Reuters|title=Gay judge never considered dropping Prop 8 case|accessdate=April 6, 2011|date=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]].

Early in his tenure, Reagan appointed [[Clarence M. Pendleton Jr.]], of [[San Diego]] as the first African American to chair the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]]. Pendleton tried to steer the commission into a conservative direction in line with Reagan's views on social and civil rights policy during his tenure from 1981 until his sudden death in 1988. Pendleton soon aroused the ire of many civil rights advocates and feminists when he ridiculed the [[Equal pay for equal work|comparable worth]] proposal as being "[[Looney Tunes]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uky.edu/Libraries/nkaa/record.php?note_id=1144|title=Pendleton, Clarence M.

In 1984, Reagan [[Presidential Pardon|commuted]] the 18-year sentence of former [[Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry|Louisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry]] [[Gil Dozier]], a Democrat from [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], to the time served for violations of both the [[Hobbs Act|Hobbs]] and the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations]] acts. On September 23, 1980, the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana]] convicted Dozier of [[extortion]] and [[racket (crime)|racketeering]] when he pushed companies doing business with his department to make campaign contributions on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/707/862/230224/|title=707 F.2d 862: United States of America, Plaintiff-appellee, v.

===Assault===

====Announcement and reaction: 1994====
In August 1994, at the age of 83, Reagan was diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]],&lt;ref name="alzheimer's" /&gt; an incurable neurological disorder which destroys brain cells and ultimately causes death.&lt;ref name="alzheimer's" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nr2002" /&gt; In November, he informed the nation through a handwritten letter,&lt;ref name="alzheimer's"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/us/in-poignant-public-letter-reagan-reveals-that-he-has-alzheimer-s.html?pagewanted=all|title=In Poignant Public Letter, Reagan Reveals That He Has Alzheimer's|date=November 6, 1994|accessdate=December 30, 2007|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Gordon, Michael R}}&lt;/ref&gt; writing in part:{{quote|I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer's Disease&amp;nbsp;...

Altman, a physician employed as a reporter for ''[[The New York Times]]'', noted that "the line between mere forgetfulness and the beginning of Alzheimer's can be fuzzy,"&lt;ref name="sr" /&gt; and all four of Reagan's White House doctors said that they saw no evidence of Alzheimer's while he was president.&lt;ref name="sr" /&gt; Dr. John E.

Complicating the picture, Reagan suffered an episode of head trauma in July 1989, five years before his diagnosis. After being thrown from a horse in Mexico, a [[subdural hematoma]] was found and surgically treated later in the year.&lt;ref name="alzheimer's" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nr2002"&gt;Reagan, Nancy (2002), pp.&amp;nbsp;179180&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy Reagan, citing what doctors told her, asserted that her husband's 1989 fall hastened the onset of Alzheimer's disease,&lt;ref name="nr2002" /&gt; although acute brain injury has not been conclusively proven to accelerate Alzheimer's or dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Van Den Heuvel C, Thornton E, Vink R |title=Traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's disease: a review|journal=Progress in Brain Research|volume=161|pages=303316|year=2007|pmid=17618986|doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(06)61021-2|series=Progress in Brain Research|isbn=978-0-444-53017-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Szczygielski J, Mautes A, Steudel WI, Falkai P, Bayer TA, Wirths O |title=Traumatic brain injury: cause or risk of Alzheimer's disease?

As the years went on, the disease slowly destroyed Reagan's mental capacity.&lt;ref name="sr" /&gt; He was only able to recognize a few people, including his wife, Nancy.&lt;ref name="sr" /&gt; He remained active, however; he took walks through parks near his home and on beaches, played golf regularly, and until 1999 he often went to his office in nearby [[Century City, Los Angeles|Century City]].&lt;ref name="sr"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/05/us/reagan-s-twilight-a-special-report-a-president-fades-into-a-world-apart.html|title=Reagan's Twilight&amp;nbsp; A special report; A President Fades Into a World Apart|accessdate=June 18, 2008|author=Altman, Lawrence K|date=October 5, 1997|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johns, ed., ''A Companion to Ronald Reagan'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of Reagan's economic policies,&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, pp.&amp;nbsp;635638&lt;/ref&gt; foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold War,&lt;ref&gt;Beschloss, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; and a restoration of American pride and morale.&lt;ref name="cannon746" /&gt; Proponents say that he had an unabated and passionate love for the United States which restored faith in the American Dream,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/02/02/rollins.reagan/|title=Ronald Reagan restored faith in America|accessdate=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a decline in American confidence and self-respect under [[Jimmy Carter]]'s perceived weak leadership, particularly during the [[Iran hostage crisis]], as well as his gloomy, dreary outlook for the future of the United States during the 1980 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lipset |first1=Seymour Martin |last2=Schneider |first2=William |title=The Decline of Confidence in American Institutions |url=http://www.planethan.com/drupal/sites/default/files/The%20Decline%20of%20Confidence%20in%20American%20Institutions%20%20By%20Lipset%20Seymour%20Martin%20and%20Schneider%20William%20Political%20Science%20Quarterly%20Fall83%20Vol%2098%20Issue%203%20p379.pdf |work=Political Science Quarterly |accessdate=July 18, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822132334/http://www.planethan.com/drupal/sites/default/files/The%20Decline%20of%20Confidence%20in%20American%20Institutions%20%20By%20Lipset%20Seymour%20Martin%20and%20Schneider%20William%20Political%20Science%20Quarterly%20Fall83%20Vol%2098%20Issue%203%20p379.pdf |archivedate=August 22, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics point out that Reagan's economic policies resulted in rising budget deficits,&lt;ref name="Cannon128" /&gt; a wider [[Wealth inequality in the United States|gap in wealth]], and an increase in [[homelessness]]&lt;ref name="DreierNation"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fredericksburg.com/opinionop-ed/don-t-add-reagan-s-face-to-mount-rushmore/article_9a329ef8-6d41-5a80-80b5-085a28f07316.html|title=Don't add Reagan's Face to Mount Rushmore|first=Peter|last=Dreier|work=[[The Nation]]|date=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the IranContra affair lowered American credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilman|first=Larry|url=http://www.espionageinfo.com/Int-Ke/Iran-Contra-Affair.html|title=Iran-Contra Affair|publisher=Advameg|accessdate=August 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinions of Reagan's legacy among the country's leading policy makers and journalists differ as well. [[Edwin Feulner]], president of [[The Heritage Foundation]], said that Reagan "helped create a safer, freer world" and said of his economic policies: "He took an America suffering from 'malaise'... and made its citizens believe again in their destiny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Feulner|first=Edwin J.|url=http://www.heritage.org/Press/Commentary/ed060904b.cfm|title=The Legacy of Ronald Reagan|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|date=June 9, 2004|accessdate=August 23, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011205706/http://heritage.org/Press/Commentary/ed060904b.cfm|archivedate=October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Mark Weisbrot]], co-Director of the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]], contended that Reagan's "economic policies were mostly a failure"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weisbrot|first=Mark|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0607-09.htm|title=Ronald Reagan's Legacy|publisher=Common Dreams News Center|date=June 7, 2004|accessdate=August 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Howard Kurtz]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' opined that Reagan was "a far more controversial figure in his time than the largely gushing obits on television would suggest."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kurtz|first=Howard|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21671-2004Jun7.html|title=Reagan: The Retake|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 7, 2004|accessdate=August 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the continuing debate surrounding his legacy, many conservative and liberal scholars agree that Reagan has been the most influential president since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], leaving his imprint on American politics, diplomacy, culture, and economics through his effective communication and pragmatic compromising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://millercenter.org/president/reagan/essays/biography/8|title=American President|accessdate=October 7, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011080053/http://millercenter.org/president/reagan/essays/biography/8|archivedate=October 11, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since he left office, historians have reached a consensus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henry|first1=David|title=Ronald Reagan and the 1980s: Perceptions, Policies, Legacies.

J. Heale, who finds that scholars now concur that Reagan rehabilitated conservatism, turned the nation to the right, practiced a considerably pragmatic conservatism that balanced ideology and the constraints of politics, revived faith in the presidency and in [[American exceptionalism]], and contributed to victory in the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;Heale, M.J. in Cheryl Hudson and Gareth Davies, eds.

In 2017 a C-SPAN survey of scholars  most of whom opposed his specific policies-- ranked Reagan in terms of leadership in  comparison with all 42 presidents.  He ranked number nine in international relations.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://static.c-span.org/assets/documents/presidentSurvey/2017%20C-SPAN%20Presidential%20Survey%20Scores%20and%20Ranks%20FINAL.PDF "C-SPAN 2017 Survey of Presidential Leadership" '' C-SPAN''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew L.

Reagan's major achievement was that the USSR collapsed, Soviet Communism collapsed, and the U.S. became the world's only superpower.  His admirers say he won the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt; For example, Peter Schweizer, ''Reagan's War: The Epic Story of his Forty Year Struggle and Final Triumph Over Communism'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  After 40 years of high tension, the USSR pulled back in the last years of Reagan's second term. In 1989 the Kremlin lost control of all its East European satellites.  In 1991 Communism was overthrown in the USSR, and on December 25, 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist.  The resulting states were no threat to the U.S.  Reagan's exact role is debated, with many believing that Reagan's defense policies, economic policies, military policies and hard line rhetoric against the Soviet Union and Communism, as well as summits with General Secretary Gorbachev played a significant part in ending the Cold War.&lt;ref name="American Dreamer"&gt;{{Cite news|title=American Dreamer |last1=Meacham|first1=John |last2=Murr|first2=Andrew |last3=Clift|first3=Eleanor |last4=Lipper|first4=Tamara |last5=Breslau|first5=Karen |last6=Ordonez|first6=Jennifer|date=June 14, 2004|work=Newsweek|accessdate=June 3, 2008|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/54017?tid=relatedcl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knopf"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knopf, PhD|first=Jeffery W.|date=August 2004|title=Did Reagan Win the Cold War?|journal=Strategic Insights|volume=III|issue=8|publisher=Center for Contemporary Conflict|url=http://www.nps.edu/Academics/centers/ccc/publications/OnlineJournal/2004/aug/knopfAUG04.html|accessdate=January 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan has become an iconic figure in the Republican Party. Praise for his accomplishments were part of the standard GOP rhetoric a quarter century after his retirement. ''Washington Post'' reporter Carlos Lozada noted how the main Republican contenders in the 2016 presidential race adopted "standard GOP Gipper worship." The contenders included even [[Donald Trump]], who had previously been skeptical.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Lozada, "I just binge-read eight books by Donald Trump. Here's what I learned: From memoirs to financial advice to politics, inside the collected writings of Donald J. Trump," [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/07/30/i-just-binge-read-eight-books-by-donald-trump-heres-what-i-learned/?hpid=z1 ''Washington Post'' 30 July, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of American history most dominated by Reagan and his policies that concerned taxes, welfare, defense, the federal judiciary and the [[Cold War]] is known today as the [[Reagan Era]]. This time period emphasized that the conservative "Reagan Revolution," led by Reagan, had a permanent impact on the United States in domestic and foreign policy. The [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton administration]] is often treated as an extension of the Reagan Era, as is the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack Godwin, ''Clintonomics: How Bill Clinton Reengineered the Reagan Revolution'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Eric Foner]] noted that the Obama candidacy in 2008 "aroused a great deal of wishful thinking among those yearning for a change after nearly thirty years of Reaganism."&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, [http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/122382.html "Obama the Professional," ''The Nation'' Jan. 14, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan never left the United States during the war, but he kept a film reel that he obtained while he was in the service. The reel depicted the liberation of the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]; he believed that doubts would someday arise as to whether [[the Holocaust]] had occurred.&lt;ref name="cannon486-90"&gt;Cannon, Lou (1991), pp.&amp;nbsp;486490&lt;/ref&gt; It has been alleged that he was overheard telling Israeli foreign minister [[Yitzhak Shamir]] in 1983 that he had filmed that footage himself and helped liberate Auschwitz,&lt;ref name="cannon486-90" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaller, M., ''Reckoning with Reagan'', New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 1992, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; though this purported conversation was disputed by Secretary of State [[George P.
