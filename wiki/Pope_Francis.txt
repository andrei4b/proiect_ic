'''Pope Francis''' ({{lang-la|Franciscus}}; {{lang-it|Francesco}}; {{lang-es|Francisco}}; born '''Jorge Mario Bergoglio''';{{efn|Pronunciation: {{IPA-es|xoxe majo eoljo|}} (Spanish), {{IPA-it|bero|}} (Italian)}} 17 December 1936) is the [[List of popes|266th]] and current [[Pope]] and [[List of sovereigns of Vatican City State|sovereign]] of the [[Vatican City]] State. Francis is the first [[Jesuit]] pope, the first from the Americas, the first from the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and the first pope from outside Europe since the Syrian [[Pope Gregory III|Gregory III]], who reigned in the 8th century.

Born in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], Bergoglio worked briefly as a [[chemical technologist]] and [[Bouncer (doorman)|nightclub bouncer]] before beginning [[seminary]] studies. He was ordained a [[Catholic priest]] in 1969, and from 1973 to 1979 was Argentina's [[provincial superior]] of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). He became the [[Archbishop of Buenos Aires]] in 1998 and was created a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in 2001 by [[Pope John Paul II]]. He led the Argentine Church during the [[December 2001 riots in Argentina]]. The administrations of [[Nstor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner]] considered him a political rival. Following the [[resignation of Pope Benedict XVI]] on 28 February 2013, [[Papal conclave, 2013|a papal conclave]] elected Bergoglio as his successor on 13 March. He chose Francis as his [[papal name]] in honor of [[Saint Francis of Assisi]].

Throughout his public life, Pope Francis has been noted for his humility, emphasis on God's mercy, concern for the [[poor]]  and commitment to [[interfaith dialogue]]. He is credited with having a less formal approach to the papacy than his predecessors, for instance choosing to reside in the ''[[Domus Sanctae Marthae]]'' guesthouse rather than in the [[papal apartments]] of the [[Apostolic Palace]] used by his predecessors. In addition, due to both his Jesuit and [[Ignatian]] aesthetic, he is known for favoring simpler [[vestment]]s void of ornamentation, including refusing the traditional [[papal mozzetta]] cape upon his election, choosing silver instead of gold for his [[piscatory ring]], and keeping the same [[pectoral cross]] he had as cardinal. He maintains that the Church should be more open and welcoming. He does not support unbridled [[capitalism]], [[Marxism]], or Marxist versions of [[liberation theology]]. Francis maintains the traditional views of the Church regarding [[Abortion and the Catholic Church|abortion]], [[Marriage in the Catholic Church|marriage]], [[Ordination of women and the Catholic Church|ordination of women]], and [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|clerical celibacy]]. He opposes [[consumerism]], [[overdevelopment]], and supports taking action on [[climate change]], a focus of his papacy with the promulgation of ''[[Laudato si']]''. In international diplomacy, he helped to restore [[United StatesCuban Thaw|full diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba]]. Since the publication of ''[[Amoris laetitia]]'' in 2016, Francis has faced increasingly open criticism from theological conservatives, particularly on the question of admitting civilly divorced and remarried Catholics to [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Communion]].

==Early years==

In the sixth grade, Bergoglio attended Wilfrid Barn de los Santos ngeles, a school of the [[Salesians of Don Bosco]], in [[Ramos Meja]], Buenos Aires. He attended the technical secondary school Escuela Tcnica Industrial N 27 Hiplito Yrigoyen,&lt;ref name="techniciandegree"/&gt; named after [[Hiplito Yrigoyen|a past President of Argentina]], and graduated with a chemical technician's diploma.&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Reese | first = Thomas | author-link = Thomas J.

Bergoglio found his vocation to the priesthood while he was on his way to celebrate the [[Spring Day#Argentina|Spring Day]]. He passed by a church to go to [[Sacrament of Penance &amp; Reconciliation (Catholic Church)|confession]], and was inspired by the priest.&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Rubin; Francesca Ambrogetti, Pope Francis  Conversations with Jorge Bergoglio. pp. 4546&lt;/ref&gt; Bergoglio studied at the archdiocesan [[seminary]], [[Inmaculada Concepcin Seminary]], in [[Villa Devoto]], Buenos Aires, and, after three years, entered the Society of Jesus as a novice on 11 March 1958.&lt;ref name=aicabio /&gt; Bergoglio has said that, as a young seminarian, he had a crush on a girl he met and briefly doubted about continuing the religious career.&lt;ref name="celibacy" /&gt; As a Jesuit novice he studied humanities in [[Santiago]], Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=En 1958, Bergoglio hizo su noviciado en Chile |language=Spanish |url=http://www.lasegunda.com/Noticias/Nacional/2013/03/829934/En-1958-Bergoglio-hizo-su-noviciado-en-Chile|accessdate=19 March 2013|publisher=La Segunda|date=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of his novitiate in the Society of Jesus, Bergoglio officially became a Jesuit on 12 March 1960, when he made the religious profession of the initial, perpetual vows of [[poverty, chastity and obedience]] of a member of the order.&lt;ref&gt;Lanser, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RO42"&gt;Rosales &amp; Olivera, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, Bergoglio obtained a [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] in philosophy from the [[Colegio Mximo de San Jos]] in [[San Miguel, Buenos Aires|San Miguel]], [[Buenos Aires Province]]. He taught literature and [[psychology]] at the [[Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepcin (Argentina)|Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepcin]], a high school in [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], from 1964 to 1965.

===Presbyterate (1969-1992)===
In 1967, Bergoglio finished his theological studies and was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the priesthood on 13 December 1969, by Archbishop [[Ramn Jos Castellano]]. He attended the [[Facultades de Filosofa y Teologa de San Miguel]] (Philosophical and Theological Faculty of San Miguel), a seminary in San Miguel. He served as the [[master of novices]] for the province there and became a professor of theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Biografa: Quin es Jorge Bergoglio?|url=http://www.news.va/es/news/biografia-quien-es-jorge-mario-bergoglio|accessdate=8 May 2015|publisher=Vatican|date=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergoglio completed his final stage of spiritual training as a Jesuit, [[tertianship]], at [[Alcal de Henares]], Spain. He took the final [[fourth vow]] (obedience to the pope) in the Society of Jesus on 22 April 1973.&lt;ref name="RO42"/&gt; He was named [[provincial superior]] of the Society of Jesus in Argentina on 31 July 1973 and served until 1979.&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sjvows&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios-b.htm#Bergoglio |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318051517/http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios-b.htm |archivedate=18 March 2014 |title=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church&amp;nbsp; Biographies&amp;nbsp; A |publisher=Florida International University |date= |accessdate=19 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1973, shortly after being named provincial superior, but his stay was shortened by the outbreak of the [[Yom Kippur War]].&lt;ref name="travel"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lastampa.it/2014/03/29/esteri/vatican-insider/en/why-bergoglio-travels-so-little-NbBzQ8c3DvALud1JCTH5HP/pagina.html|title= Why Bergoglio travels so little|date= 29 March 2014|work= |publisher= Vatican Insider|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the completion of his term of office, in 1980 he was named the [[Rector (academic)|rector]] of the Philosophical and Theological Faculty of San Miguel in San Miguel.&lt;ref&gt;The Vatican Today, 13 March 2013, [http://www.news.va/en/news/biography-who-is-jorge-mario-bergoglio Biography: who is Jorge Mario Bergoglio?], retrieved 6 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Before taking up this new appointment, he spent the first three months of 1980 in Ireland to learn English, staying at the Jesuit Centre at the [[Milltown Institute of Theology and Philosophy]], Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Independent'', 30 March 2013, [http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/the-year-pope-francis-came-to-live-in-dublin-29163804.html], retrieved 10 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to Argentina to take up his new post at San Miguel, Father Bergoglio served in that capacity until 1986.&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt; He was removed as rector by the Jesuit superior-general [[Peter Hans Kolvenbach]] because Bergoglio's policy of educating the young Jesuits in direct pastoral work and in popular religiosity was opposed to the worldwide trend in the Society of Jesus of emphasizing social justice based on sociological analysis, especially promoted by the Centro de Investigaciones y Accion Social (CIAS).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Austen Ivereigh, The Great Reformer: Francis and the Making of a Radical Pope, Henry Holt 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 June 1997, Bergoglio was appointed [[Coadjutor Bishop|Coadjutor Archbishop]] of Buenos Aires with right of automatic succession. Upon Quarracino's death on 28 February 1998, Bergoglio became Metropolitan Archbishop of Buenos Aires. In that role, Bergoglio created new parishes and restructured the archdiocese administrative offices, led pro-life initiatives, and created a commission on divorces.&lt;ref name="directory"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jesuit Argentine Cardinal Bergoglio elected pope, takes name Francis|url=http://www.jesuit.org/2013/03/13/jesuit-argentine-cardinal-jesuit-bergoglio-elected-pope-takes-name-francis-i|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316025854/http://www.jesuit.org/2013/03/13/jesuit-argentine-cardinal-jesuit-bergoglio-elected-pope-takes-name-francis-i|archivedate=16 March 2013|publisher=jesuit.org|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Bergoglio's major initiatives as archbishop was to increase the Church's presence in the slums of Buenos Aires.

Early in his time as Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Bergoglio sold off the archdiocese's shares in multiple banks and turned its accounts into those of a normal customer in international banks. The shares in banks had led the local church to a propensity towards high spending, and the archdiocese was nearing bankruptcy as a result. As a normal customer of the bank, the church was forced into a higher fiscal discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coday |first=Dennis |url=http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/former-aide-says-francis-may-close-vatican-bank |title=John Allen, "Former aide says Francis may close Vatican Bank"|publisher= National Catholic Reporter |date=4 April 2013 |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 November 1998, while remaining Archbishop of Buenos Aires, he was named [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] for those [[Eastern Rite Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholics]] in Argentina who lacked a [[prelate]] of their own rite.&lt;ref name=aica/&gt; Major Archbishop [[Sviatoslav Shevchuk]] has said that Bergoglio understands the liturgy, rites, and spirituality of his Greek Catholic Church and always "took care of our Church in Argentina" as ordinary for Eastern Catholics during his time as Archbishop of Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name="greek"/&gt;

In 2000, Bergoglio was the only church official to reconcile with [[Jernimo Podest]], a former bishop who had been suspended as a priest after opposing the [[Argentine Revolution]] military dictatorship in 1972. He defended Podest's wife from Vatican attacks on their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Magister |first=Sandro |title=Jorge Mario Bergoglio, Profession: Servant of the Servants of God |url=http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/1335696?eng=y|accessdate=16 March 2013|publisher=L'espresso|date=2 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hebblethwaite|first=Margaret|title=The Pope Francis I know|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/14/the-pope-francis-i-know|accessdate=16 March 2013|publisher=The Guardian (UK)|date=14 March 2013|quote=Luro talked to me at length about her friend, of whom she has the highest opinion, and told me how she would write to him almost weekly, and he would always reply by ringing her up and having a short chat.

==Relations with Argentine governments==

===Dirty War===
Bergoglio was the subject of allegations regarding the kidnapping of two [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priests during Argentina's [[Dirty War]].&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/world/europe/new-pope-theologically-conservative-but-with-a-common-touch.html|title=A Conservative With a Common Touch|date=13 March 2013|publisher=The New York Times|last2=Rother|first2=Larry|last1=Schmall|first1=Emily|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He feared for the priests' safety and had tried to change their work prior to their arrest; however, contrary to reports, he never tried to throw them out of the Jesuit order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/francis-jesuits-and-dirty-war|title=Thomas Reese, "Francis, the Jesuits and the Dirty War", '&amp;#39;National Catholic Reporter'&amp;#39;, 17 March 2013|last=Coday|first=Dennis|date=17 March 2013|publisher=National Catholic Reporter|accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Myriam Bregman]], a human rights lawyer, filed a criminal complaint against Bergoglio, as superior in the Society of Jesus of Argentina, accusing him of involvement in the Navy's kidnapping of the two priests in May 1976.&lt;ref name="latimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/17/world/fg-cardinal17|title=Argentine Cardinal Named in Kidnap Lawsuit|date=17 April 2005|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawyer's complaint did not specify the nature of Bergoglio's alleged involvement, and Bergoglio's spokesman flatly denied the allegations.

Yorio accused Bergoglio of effectively handing them over to the death squads by declining to tell the authorities that he endorsed their work. Yorio, who died in 2000, said in a 1999 interview that he believed that Bergoglio did nothing "to free us, in fact just the opposite".&lt;ref name="WAPO"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pope's activity in Dirty War Draws Scrutiny|date=17 March 2013|work=Chicago Tribune|agency=Washington Post|location=Sec. 1|page=27|author=Miroff, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jalics initially refused to discuss the complaint after moving into seclusion in a German monastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/03/pope_francis_a_look_at_the_lif.html|title=Pope Francis: A look at the life of the first South American pontiff|date=13 March 2013|work=The Star-Ledger|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, two days after the election of Pope Francis, Jalics issued a statement confirming the kidnapping and attributing the cause to a former lay colleague who became a guerrilla, was captured, and named Yorio and Jalics when interrogated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jesuiten.org/aktuelles/details/article/erklarung-von-pater-franz-jalics-sj.html|title=Declaration of Father Franz Jalics SJ|date=15 March 2013|publisher=German Jesuit Web site|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, Jalics issued a second, clarifying statement: "It is wrong to assert that our capture took place at the initiative of Father Bergoglio  the fact is, Orlando Yorio and I were not denounced by Father Bergoglio."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/21/pope-francis-argentinian-junta-priest|title=Pope Francis did not denounce me to Argentinian junta, says priest|last=Watts|first=Jonathan|date=21 March 2013|publisher=''The Guardian''|location=London|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jesuiten.org/aktuelles/details/article/erganzende-erklarung-von-pater-franz-jalics-sj.html|title=Second Declaration of Father Franz Jalics SJ|date=20 March 2013|publisher=German Jesuit Web site|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Bergoglio became Pope, an alleged photo of him giving the [[sacramental bread]] to dictator Jorge Rafael Videla became viral in social networks. It has also been used by the newspaper ''[[Pgina/12]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoomnews.es/34129/actualidad/mundo/bergoglio-historia-papa-francisco-dictadura-argentina-videla|title=Bergoglio: la verdadera historia del Papa Francisco y la dictadura de Videla|last=Cifuentes|first=Pedro|date=15 March 2013|publisher=Zoom News|language=Spanish|trans-title=Bergoglio: the true story of Pope Francis and Videla's dictatorship|accessdate=28 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130701131917/http://www.zoomnews.es/34129/actualidad/mundo/bergoglio-historia-papa-francisco-dictadura-argentina-videla|archivedate=1 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photo was soon proved to be false. It was revealed that the priest, whose face is not visible in the photo, was Carlos Bern de Astrada. The photo was taken at the church "Pequea Obra de la Divina Providencia Don Orione" in 1990, not during the Dirty War, and after Videla's presidential pardon. The photo was produced by the agency AFP and it was initially published by the ''[[Crnica (newspaper)|Crnica]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infotechnology.com/internet/The-fake-viral-photo-of-pope-Francis-who-is-the-priest-that-gives-the-communion-to-Videla-20130319-0002.html|title=The fake viral photo of pope Francis: who is the priest that gives the communion to Videla|date=19 March 2013|publisher=Info Technology|lastauthoramp=yes|author1=Joaqun Garau|author2=Pablo Martn Fernndez|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fernando de la Ra===
[[Fernando de la Ra]] replaced [[Carlos Menem]] as president of Argentina in 1999. As an archbishop, Bergoglio celebrated the annual Mass at the [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral]] on the ''[[First National Government]]'' holiday, 25 May. In 2000, Bergoglio criticized the perceived apathy of society.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina faced an [[19982002 Argentine great depression|economic depression]] at the time, and the Church criticized the fiscal austerity of the government, which increased poverty. De la Ra asked the Church to promote a dialogue between the leaders of economic and political sectors to find a solution for the crisis. He claims that he talked with Bergoglio and proposed to take part in the meeting, but Bergoglio would have told him that the meeting was cancelled because of a misunderstanding by De la Ra's assistant, who may have declined the president's assistance. Bishop [[Jorge Casaretto]] considers it unlikely, as De la Ra only made the request in newspaper interviews, but never made a formal request to the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Reato, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Justicialist Party]] won the [[Argentine legislative election, 2001|2001 elections]] and got the majority in the Congress, and appointed [[Ramn Puerta]] as president of the Senate. As vice president [[Carlos lvarez (politician)|Carlos lvarez]] resigned shortly before, this left an opposing party second in the [[Argentine order of precedence|order of precedence]]. Bergoglio asked for an interview with Puerta, and had a positive impression of him. Puerta told him that the Justicialist party was not plotting to oust De la Ra, and promised to help the president promote the laws that may be required.&lt;ref&gt;Reato, pp. 222223&lt;/ref&gt;

During police repression of the [[December 2001 riots in Argentina|riots of December 2001]], he contacted the Ministry of the Interior and asked that the police distinguish rioters engaged in acts of vandalism from peaceful protesters.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, pp. 1819&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nstor and Cristina Kirchner===
[[File:Pope Francis with Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner 4.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Francis with Argentine president [[Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner]]]]
When Bergoglio celebrated Mass at the Cathedral for the 2004 ''First National Government'' holiday, President [[Nstor Kirchner]] attended and heard Bergoglio request more political dialogue, reject intolerance, and criticize exhibitionism and strident announcements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/604859-el-mensaje-de-la-iglesia-era-para-kirchner|title=El mensaje de la Iglesia era para Kirchner|last=Obarrio|first=Mariano|date=27 May 2004|publisher=La Nacin|language=Spanish|trans-title=The message of the church was for Kirchner|work=|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirchner celebrated the national day elsewhere the following year and the Mass in the Cathedral was suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/706830-suspendio|title=Suspendi la Iglesia el tedeum en la Capital|last=Colonna|first=Lucas|date=24 May 2005|publisher=La Nacin|language=Spanish|trans-title=The church suspended the tedeum in the capital|work=|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Bergoglio helped the fellow Jesuit [[Joaqun Pia]] to win the elections in the [[Misiones Province]] and prevent an amendment of the local constitution that would allow indefinite re-elections. Kirchner intended to use that project to start similar amendments at other provinces, and eventually to the national constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Reato, pp. 224225&lt;/ref&gt; Kirchner considered Bergoglio as a political rival to the day he died in October 2010.&lt;ref name="anios"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1562777-jorge-bergoglio-y-los-kirchner-anos-de-una-relacion-tensa|title=Jorge Bergoglio y los Kirchner: aos de una relacin tensa|date=14 March 2013|publisher=La Nacin|language=Spanish|trans-title=Jorge Bergoglio and the Kirchners: years of a tense relation|work=|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergoglio's relations with Kirchner's widow and successor, [[Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner]], have been similarly tense. In 2008, Bergoglio called for national reconciliation during [[2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector|disturbances]] in the country's agricultural regions, which the government interpreted as a support for anti-government demonstrators.&lt;ref name="anios"/&gt; The campaign to enact [[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|same-sex marriage legislation]] was a particularly tense period in their relations.&lt;ref name="anios"/&gt;

When Bergoglio was elected pope, the initial reactions were mixed. Most of the Argentine society cheered it, but the pro-government newspaper ''[[Pgina/12]]'' published renewed allegations about the Dirty War, and the president of the [[National Library of the Argentine Republic|National Library]] described a global conspiracy theory. The president took more than an hour before congratulating the new Pope, and only did so in a passing reference within a routine speech. However, due to the Pope's popularity in Argentina, Cristina Kirchner made what the political analyst Claudio Fantini called a "[[Copernican Revolution (metaphor)|Copernican shift]]" in her relations with him and fully embraced the Francis phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/27/christina-fernandez-de-kirchner-pope-francis|title=Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner turns Pope Francis from foe to friend|date=27 March 2013|publisher=The Guardian|author=Associated Press in Buenos Aires|work=|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day before his inauguration as pope, Bergoglio, now Francis, had a private meeting with Kirchner. They exchanged gifts and lunched together. This was the new pope's first meeting with a head of state, and there was speculation that the two were mending their relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cp24.com/world/pope-s-diplomacy-put-to-test-as-leaders-flock-to-rome-1.1200040|title=Pope's diplomacy put to test as leaders flock to Rome|date=18 March 2013|publisher=CP24|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2013/0318/Making-nice-Argentina-s-Kirchner-and-Pope-Francis-meet-in-Rome-video|title=Making nice?

Elected at the age of 76, Francis was reported to be healthy and his doctors have said his missing lung tissue, removed in his youth, does not have a significant impact on his health.&lt;ref name="Pope Francis's missing lung should not be a problem, say doctors"/&gt; The only concern would be decreased respiratory reserve if he had a respiratory infection.&lt;ref name="Why Pope Francis Only Has One Lung"/&gt; In the past, one attack of [[sciatica]] in 2007 prevented him from attending a consistory and delayed his return to Argentina for several days.&lt;ref name="falasca" /&gt;

Francis is the first [[Jesuit]] pope.

Many media reported him as being the first non-European pope, but he is actually the 11th; the previous was [[Pope Gregory III|Gregory III]] from Syria, who died in 741.

As pope, his manner is less formal than that of his immediate predecessors: a style that news coverage has referred to as "no frills", noting that it is "his common touch and accessibility that is proving the greatest inspiration."&lt;ref name="nofrills"&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505263_162-57576725/pope-francis-brings-no-frills-style-to-papacy/ "Pope Francis brings no-frills style to papacy"], CBS News, 28 March 2013, Retrieved 28 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of his election, he took a bus back to his hotel with the cardinals, rather than be driven in the papal car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/16/us-pope-poor-idUSBRE92F05P20130316|title=Pope Francis wants a 'poor Church for the poor'|date=16 March 2013|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, he visited Cardinal [[Jorge Mara Meja]] in the hospital and chatted with patients and staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/retired-argentine-cardinal-heart-attack/comments?type=story&amp;id=18736841|title=Pope visits ailing Argentine cardinal in hospital|date=|publisher=ABC News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316062247/http://abcnews.go.com/International/retired-argentine-cardinal-heart-attack/comments?type=story&amp;id=18736841|archivedate=16 March 2013|work=|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his first media audience, the Saturday after his election, the Pope said of Saint Francis of Assisi: "The man who gives us this spirit of peace, the poor man", and he added "[h]ow I would like a poor Church, and for the poor".&lt;ref name=PapalName/&gt;

This is the first time that a pope has been named ''Francis''.

They asked it on the grounds that it would be anomalous that married Anglican priests can be received into the Catholic Church and ordained as priests, by means of either the [[Pastoral Provision]] of 20 June 1980 or the 2009 [[Anglican ordinariate]], but married Catholic men cannot do the same.&lt;ref name="teahan"&gt;Teahan, Madeleine, [http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2013/03/27/catholic-mps-urge-pope-francis-to-allow-ordination-of-married-men/ "Catholic MPs urge Pope Francis to allow ordination of married men"], The Catholic Herald, 27 March 2013, Retrieved 27 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 March 2013 Francis used his first [[Urbi et Orbi|Easter homily]] to make a plea for peace throughout the world, specifically mentioning the Middle East, Africa, and North and South Korea.&lt;ref name="eastersermon"&gt;Lymon, Eric J., [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/03/31/easter-vatican-pope/2039617/ "Pope Francis makes pleas for peace on Easter Sunday"], Usa Today, 31 March 2013, Retrieved 31 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He also spoke out against those who give in to "easy gain" in a world filled with greed, and made a plea for humanity to become a better guardian of creation by protecting the environment.&lt;ref name="eastersermon"/&gt; He said that "[w]e ask the risen Jesus, who turns death into life, to change hatred into love, vengeance into forgiveness, war into peace."&lt;ref name="risenjesus"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21986185 "Pope Francis delivers Easter plea for peace"], BBC News, 31 March 2013, Retrieved 31 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Vatican had prepared greetings in 65 languages, Francis chose not to read them.&lt;ref name="languages"/&gt; According to the Vatican, the pope "at least for now, feels at ease using Italian, the everyday language of the Holy See".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130401151028/http://www.latimes.com/news/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-pope-francis-easter-mass-20130331%2C0%2C1763686.story "Pope Francis makes an Easter plea for peace"], Los Angeles Times (from AP), 31 March 2013, Retrieved 31 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Francis initially reaffirmed the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]]'s program to [[Leadership Conference of Women Religious#Doctrinal issues|reform the U.S. Leadership Conference of Women Religious]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-backs-reform-of-us-sisters-leadership-conference/|title=Pope backs reform of US sisters' leadership conference|last=Uebbing|first=David|date=15 April 2013|publisher=Catholic News Agency|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; initiated under his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the Vatican had formed the opinion in 2012 that the sisters' group was tinged with feminist influences, focused too much on ending social and economic injustice and not enough on stopping abortion, and permitted speakers at its meetings who questioned church doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/us/pope-upholds-reprimand-of-nuns-group.html|title=Pope Upholds Reprimand of American Nuns' Group|last=Goodstein|first=Laurie|date=15 April 2013|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-backs-reform-of-us-sisters-leadership-conference/|title=David Uebbing, "Pope backs reform of US sisters' leadership conference", '&amp;#39;Catholic News Agency'&amp;#39;, 15 April 2013|date=|publisher=Catholic News Agency|accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in April 2015 the investigation was brought to a close.

On 12 May, Francis carried out his first [[canonization]]s of candidates approved for sainthood during the reign of Benedict XVI: the first Colombian saint, [[Laura of Saint Catherine of Siena]], the second female Mexican saint, [[Maria Guadalupe Garcia Zavala]], both of the 20th century, and the 813 15th-century [[Martyrs of Otranto]]. He said: "While we venerate the martyrs of Otranto, ask God to support the many Christians who still suffer from violence and give them the courage and fate and respond to evil with goodness." He also commented on abortion, saying legislation should be introduced to "protect all human beings from the first moment of their existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/europe/2013/05/201351212314711566.html|title=Francis canonises first saints of his papacy|date=12 May 2013|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consultation with Catholic laity===
A February 2014 survey by [[World Values Survey]] cited in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' shows how the unity Pope Francis had created could be challenged. Although views about Francis personally were favorable, many Catholics disagreed with at least some of his teachings. The survey found that members of the Catholic Church are deeply divided over abortion, artificial contraception, divorce, the ordination of women, and married priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/pope-francis-faces-church-divided-over-doctrine-global-poll-of-catholics-finds/2014/02/08/e90ecef4-8f89-11e3-b227-12a45d109e03_story.html|title=Pope Francis faces church divided over doctrine, global poll of Catholics finds|last=Boorstein|first=Michelle|date=9 February 2014|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://world.time.com/2014/02/09/poll-catholic-beliefs-at-odds-with-vatican-doctrine/|title=Poll: Catholic Beliefs at Odds With Vatican Doctrine|last=Frizell|first=Sam|date=9 February 2014|work=TIME.com|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month Pope Francis asked parishes to provide answers to an official questionnaire&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141027095239/http://press.vatican.va/content/dam/salastampa/it/bollettino/documentazione-linkata/Documento-preparatorio-IIIAssGenStraod_ENG.pdf Vatican: Synod of Bishops  Extraordinary General Assembly  Pastoral Challenges to the Family in the Context of Evangelization  Preparatory Document, Vatican City 2013].

He continued to assert [[Catholic doctrine]], in less dramatic tone than his recent predecessors, who maintained that the Catholic Church is not a democracy of popular opinion.&lt;ref name="Clement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.gnom.es/news/pope-francis-faces-church-divided-over-doctrine-global-poll-of-catholics-finds|title=Pope Francis faces church divided over doctrine, global poll of Catholics finds|last=Clement|first=Scott|date=23 February 2014|publisher=National News Service|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223020300/http://news.gnom.es/news/pope-francis-faces-church-divided-over-doctrine-global-poll-of-catholics-finds|archivedate=23 February 2014|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linda Woodhead]] of [[Lancaster University]] wrote of the survey Francis initiated, "it's not a survey in any sense that a social scientist would recognize." Woodhead said that many ordinary Catholics would have difficulty understanding theological [[jargon]] there. Nonetheless, she suspected the survey might be influential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/culture/7408/new_poll___faithful_catholics__an_endangered_species|title=New Poll: 'Faithful Catholics' an Endangered Species|date=12 December 2013|publisher=University of Southern California|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Church in England and Wales]] {{As of|2014|4|lc=y}} had refused to publish results of this survey; a Church spokesman said a senior Vatican official had expressly asked for summaries to remain confidential, and that orders had come from the Pope that the information should not be made public until after October. This disappointed many reformers who hoped the laity would be more involved in decision-making. Some other Catholic churches, for example in [[Catholic Church in Germany|Germany]] and [[Catholic Church in Austria|Austria]], published summaries of the responses to the survey, which showed a wide gap between Church teaching and the behavior of ordinary Catholics.&lt;ref name="bbc27060172" /&gt;

In a column he wrote for the Vatican's semi-official newspaper ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'', the head Prefect of the [[Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura]], US Cardinal [[Raymond Leo Burke]], who has a long-standing reputation as one of the church's most vocal conservative hard-liners, said that Pope Francis opposed both abortion and [[gay marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/us-cardinal-raymond-burke-pope-francis-opposes-abortion-and-gay-marriage/2014/02/21/de5dbf52-9b36-11e3-975d-107dfef7b668_story.html|title=U.S. Cardinal Raymond Burke: Pope Francis opposes abortion and gay marriage|last=Gibson|first=David|date=21 February 2014|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican's chief spokesman, Father [[Federico Lombardi]], also noted in the Vatican Press Office during the 2014 consistory meetings that Pope Francis and Cardinal [[Walter Kasper]] would not change or redefine any dogmas pertaining to Church theology on doctrinal matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romereports.com/pg155838-lombardi-no-cardinal-believes-in-changing-church-doctrine-en|title=Lombardi: No cardinal believes in changing Church doctrine|date=|publisher=Rome Reports|accessdate=24 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301012319/http://www.romereports.com/pg155838-lombardi-no-cardinal-believes-in-changing-church-doctrine-en|archivedate=1 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Papal documents===
On 29 June 2013, Pope Francis published his first [[encyclical]], titled ''[[Lumen fidei]]''.&lt;ref name="The Holy See"/&gt;  It is a [[collaborative writing]] with Benedict XVI and talks about faith, complementing Benedict's previous encyclicals on charity and hope.&lt;ref name=lumen/&gt;  He published his second one, entitled {{italics correction|''[[Laudato si']]''}}, on 18 June 2015, concerning care for the planet.&lt;ref name="Jim Yardley and Laurie Goodstein"/&gt; On 24 November 2013, he published his [[apostolic exhortation]] ''[[Evangelii gaudium]]'',&lt;ref name="Evangelii gaudium"/&gt; with his views on [[#Faith and evangelization|faith and evangelization]].&lt;ref name=egsummary/&gt; On 8 April 2016, Pope Francis published his second apostolic exhortation, ''[[Amoris laetitia]]'',&lt;ref name="Amoris laetitia"&gt;Pope Francis (8 April 2016), [http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20160319_amoris-laetitia.html Amoris laetitia].

Controversy arose at the end of 2016 when four cardinals formally asked Pope Francis for clarifications, particularly on the issue of giving communion to divorced and civilly remarried Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2016/11/14/vaticaninsider/eng/the-vatican/four-cardinals-openly-challenge-francis-over-amoris-laetitia-62np8ZYXQkeXyBamk0M0jP/pagina.html|title=Four cardinals openly challenge Francis over "Amoris Laetitia"|last=McElwee|first=Josh|date=14 November 2016|newspaper=Vatican Insider|accessdate=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[motu proprio]]s include  ''[[Ai nostri tempi]]'' and ''[[De concordia inter codices]]''. Francis issued another titled ''[[Maiorem hac dilectionem]]'' which created a new path towards canonization for certain causes.

He established two new Secretariats (top-level departments) in the Roman Curia: the [[Secretariat for the Economy]], and the [[Secretariat for Communications]]. He [[Matrimonial nullity trial reforms of Pope Francis|reformed]] the process for declaring [[Declaration of nullity|matrimonial nullity]].&lt;ref name=trials/&gt;

On 8 December 2017, Pope Francis signed a new apostolic constitution on ecclesiastical universities and faculties ''[[Veritatis gaudium]]'', published 29 January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-revamps-ecclesiastical-universities-in-new-apostolic-constitution-77172 Pope revamps ecclesiastical universities in new apostolic constitution], Catholic News Agency, accessed 29 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

A further Apostolic Exhortation, ''[[Gaudete et exsultate]]'' (''Rejoice and be glad''), was published on 19 March 2018, dealing with "the [[Universal call to holiness|call to holiness]] in today's world" and countering contemporary versions of the [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] and [[Pelagianism|Pelagian]] [[Heresy in Christianity|heresies]] from "earlier Christian times".&lt;ref&gt;Pope Francis, [http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20180319_gaudete-et-exsultate.html ''Gaudete et exsultate], 19 March 2018, accessed 29 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clerical titles===
In January 2014, Pope Francis said that he would appoint fewer [[monsignor]]s and only assign those honored to the lowest of the three surviving ranks of monsignor, [[Chaplain of His Holiness]]. It would be awarded only to [[diocesan priest]]s at least 65 years old. During his 15 years as Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Pope Francis never sought the title for any of his priests. It is believed he associates it with clerical careerism and hierarchy, though he did not apply this restriction to clergy working in the Roman Curia or diplomatic corps, where careerism is an even greater concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/en/the-vatican/detail/articolo/31027/|title=Pope abolishes honorary title of monsignor for diocesan priests under the age of 65|last=O'Connell|first=Gerard|date=4 January 2014|publisher=Vatican Insider|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consistories===
{{Main article|Cardinals created by Francis}}
At the first [[Papal consistory|consistory]] of his papacy, held on 22 February 2014, Francis created 19 new cardinals. At the time of their elevation to that rank, 16 of these new cardinals were under eighty years of age and thus eligible to vote in a [[papal conclave]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26301947 Pope Francis appoints 19 new cardinals in Rome ceremony], BBC News, 22 February 2014. Accessed 22 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The new appointees included prelates from South America, Africa, and Asia, including appointees in some of the world's poorest countries, such as [[Chibly Langlois]] from [[Haiti]] and [[Philippe Oudraogo (bishop)|Philippe Nakellentuba Ouedraogo]] from [[Burkina Faso]].&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/22/us-pope-consistory-benedict-idUSBREA1L07X20140222 Pope Francis inducts new cardinals as predecessor Benedict looks on], Reuters, 22 February 2014. Accessed 22 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The consistory was a rare occasion in which Francis and his predecessor, [[Benedict XVI]], appeared together in public.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

Benedict XVI also attended the second consistory on 14 February 2015, at which Francis elevated 20 new cardinals, with 15 under the age of eighty and five over the age of eighty. The pope continued his practice of appointing cardinals from the peripheries, such as [[Charles Maung Bo]] of [[Myanmar]] and [[Soane Patita Paini Mafi]] of [[Tonga]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.news.va/en/news/230499 Annuncio di Concistoro per la creazione di nuovi Cardinali]" NEWS.VA Official Vatican Network. 4 January 2015.

Francis presided over the third consistory of his papacy on 19 November 2016, elevating 17 new cardinals. Of that total number at the time of their elevation, 13 were under the age of eighty and four were over the age of eighty. Francis continued his previous practice of elevating cardinals from the peripheries with an emphasis again on Asia and Africa, such as [[Patrick D'Rozario]] from Bangladesh and [[Dieudonn Nzapalainga]] from the [[Central African Republic]], while also naming the first three American cardinals of his papacy and only one Curial appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/06/28/pope_francis_allocution_at_cardinals_creation_consistory/1321890|title=Pope Francis: Allocution at Consistory for Creation of Cardinals|access-date=2018-02-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pope presided over a fourth consistory for the elevation of 5 new cardinals on the afternoon of 28 June 2017. Each of the five were under the age of eighty, and were thus eligible to vote in a papal conclave. This consistory was noteworthy for the fact that, with the pope continuing the trend of elevating cardinals from a diverse range of areas, no cardinals elevated are of the Roman Curia, and one was a mere auxiliary bishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.ncregister.com/daily-news/francis-fifth-a-synod-humanae-vitae-milestone-and-more-decentralized-church#.WnfnHYY76Ec|title=Francis Fifth: A Synod, Humanae Vitae Milestone and More Decentralized Church|website=m.ncregister.com|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy}}
With his April 2015 [[papal bull]] of indiction, ''Misericordiae Vultus'' ([[Latin]]: "The Face of [[Mercy]]"), Francis inaugurated a Special [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee Year]] of Mercy, to run from 8 December 2015, [[Solemnity]] of the [[Immaculate Conception]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], to the last Sunday before [[Advent]] and the Solemnity of the [[Feast of Christ the King]] of the Universe on 20 November 2016.

The [[Holy Door]]s of the major basilicas of Rome (including the Great Door of St. Peter's) were opened, and special "Doors of Mercy" were opened at cathedrals and other major churches around the world, where the faithful can earn indulgences by fulfilling the usual conditions of prayer for the Pope's intentions, confession, and detachment from sin, and communion.&lt;ref name=opening/&gt; During Lent of that year, special 24-hour penance services will be celebrated, and during the year, special qualified and experienced priests called "Missionaries of Mercy" will be available in every diocese to forgive even severe, special-case sins normally reserved to the Holy See's [[Apostolic Penitentiary]].&lt;ref name=Misericordiae/&gt;&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

In the Venezuelan crisis, Francis has not openly denounced the acts of [[Nicols Maduro|Nicolas Maduro]], despite the reiterated requests made by the local bishops.

On a theological level, controversy arose after the publication of the apostolic exhortation ''[[Amoris laetitia]]''.

In February 2017, posters appeared around Rome featuring a stern-looking Pope Francis, complaining about Francis's actions against conservative Catholics, and challenging his reputation for mercy. According to vaticanist Ins San Martn this is "the first time in most Romans' memories that the city has seen posters in major public venues complaining about the policies of a given pope".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2017/02/04/rome-wakes-find-city-full-anti-pope-francis-posters/|title=Rome wakes up to find city full of anti-Pope Francis posters|last=San Martn|first=Ins|date=4 February 2017|newspaper=Crux|access-date=4 February 2017|work=|language=en-US|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A week later, the Pope was targeted by a [[fake news]], which spoofed ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2017/02/10/fake-vatican-newspaper-delivers-new-shot-pope-francis/|title=Fake Vatican newspaper delivers new shot at Pope Francis|last=San Martn|first=Ins|date=10 February 2017|newspaper=Crux|access-date=11 February 2017|work=|language=en-US|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the [[Council of Cardinal Advisers]] appointed by the Pope voiced its "full support" to Francis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/amid-controversy-council-of-cardinals-backs-pope-francis-71879/|title=Amid controversy, council of cardinals backs Pope Francis|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 2017, when Cardinal [[Donald Wuerl]] was asked about the Pope's critics, he concluded: "I think, there are just some people who can't bring themselves to move beyond where they are.

Capuchin Father [[Thomas Weinandy]], ex-doctrine chief of US Bishops, wrote a letter to Pope Francis on July 31, 2017, which he subsequently made public, in which he charged that Pope Francis is fostering "chronic confusion", "demeaning" the importance of doctrine, appointing bishops who "scandalize" believers with dubious "teaching and pastoral practice", giving prelates who object the impression they will be "marginalized or worse" if they speak out, and causing faithful Catholics to "lose confidence in their supreme shepherd".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2017/11/01/ex-bishops-doctrine-chief-says-darkness-coming-light-francis/|title=Ex-bishops doctrine chief says darkness coming to light under Francis|date=2017-11-01|work=Crux|access-date=2017-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Father Weinandy resigned as a consultant to the Committee on Doctrine of the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] (USCCB) on the day he publicized the letter, and Cardinal [[Daniel DiNardo]], President of the USCCB, responded with a statement in which he said, {{" '}}every good Christian ought to be more eager to put a good interpretation on a neighbor's statement than to condemn it.'

Francis told ''[[La Civilt Cattolica]]'' that the church does not need to speak constantly of the issues of abortion, artificial [[contraception]], and homosexuality. He thought that other issues, notably the duty to help those who are poor and marginalized, have been neglected. He added that the church had focused in trivial issues, and as such should not be so prone to condemn, and that priests should be more welcoming. He said the [[confessional]] should be used to motivate people to better themselves.&lt;ref name=Goodstein&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/world/europe/pope-bluntly-faults-churchs-focus-on-gays-and-abortion.html?hp&amp;_r=0|title= Pope Says Church Is 'Obsessed' With Gays, Abortion and Birth Control|first= Laurie|last= Goodstein|date= 19 September 2013|publisher= The New York Times|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC19thSept&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24166434 |title=BBC News  Pope Francis: Church too focused on gays and abortion |publisher=BBC News |date=19 September 2013 |accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/09/20139202523642396.html |title=Pope urges more understanding for gays  Europe |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= 20 December 2013|accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Migliaccio |first=Alessandra |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-19/pope-says-church-should-stop-obsessing-over-gays-abortion.html |title=Pope Says Church Should Stop Obsessing Over Gays, Abortion |publisher=Bloomberg |date=19 September 2013 |accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mercy===
{{See also|Mercy#Christianity}}Pope Francis said that the most powerful message of Jesus Christ is mercy.&lt;ref name="vatican.va"&gt;{{cite web |author=Pope Francis |url= http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/homilies/2013/documents/papa-francesco_20130317_omelia-santa-anna.html|title= Holy mass in the parish of St. Anna in the Vatican|date= 17 March 2013|publisher=Holy See |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His motto, ''Miserando atque eligendo'', is about Jesus's mercy towards sinners. The phrase is taken from a homily of [[Bede|Saint Bede]], who commented that Jesus "saw [[Matthew the Apostle|the tax collector]] and, because he saw him ''through the eyes of mercy and chose him'', he said to him: 'Follow me{{' "}}.{{efn|Italics added to refer to English translation of the Latin motto}}&lt;ref name="Catholic News Service"/&gt; The motto is a reference to the moment when he found his vocation to the priesthood, at the age of 17. He started a day of student celebrations by going to confession.&lt;ref name="viewonline.fromdoppler.com"&gt;[http://viewonline.fromdoppler.com/pfie/eqaehB/c/a/a El Jesuita.

As cardinal he thought Christian morality is not a titanic effort of the will, but a response to the mercy of God. It is not a matter of never falling down but of always getting up again. In this sense, he says Christian morality is a revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=17312|title=The future Pope Francis: additional interviews and writings|work=catholicculture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gospel reading for the Sunday he was scheduled to give his first public address as pope was on Jesus's [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|forgiveness of the adulterous woman]]. This allowed him to discuss the principle that God never wearies of forgiving humans and to stress the importance of never tiring in asking for forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/on-forgiveness On Forgiveness], Pope Francis, Vatican City, 17 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this emphasis, many have returned to God and to [[Sacrament of Penance &amp; Reconciliation (Catholic Church)|confession]], a result which has been called the "Pope Francis effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicreview.org/article/faith/vatican-news/pope-francis-top-ten-reasons-to-go-to-confession%7cPope|title=Catholic news from the Archdiocese of Baltimore and around the world|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catholicvote.org/the-pope-francis-effect-confession-boom-continues/|title=The Pope Francis Effect: Confession Boom Continues|work=CatholicVote.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there seems to be no such effect in counteracting the free fall of vocations, among the Jesuits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reilly |first=Patrick |url=http://www.ncregister.com/blog/reilly/american-jesuits-are-in-a-free-fall-and-the-crisis-is-getting-worse |title=American Jesuits Are in a Free Fall, and the Crisis is Getting Worse |date=28 July 2016 |newspaper=[[National Catholic Register]] |accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Pope Francis |title=Opening of the works of the 71st General Assembly of the Italian Episcopal Conference (C.E.I.) in the presence of the Holy Father, 20.05.2018 |url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:qtAdP1uvpzAJ:press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2018/05/20/180522d.html+%22The+first+thing+that+troubles+me+is+the+crisis+of+vocations.+And+it+is+our+paternity+that+is+at+stake+here%22%22this+concern,+rather,+this+haemorrhage+of+vocations%22 |work=vatican.va |location=New Synod Hall |date=20 May 2018 |accessdate=23 May 2018 |quote=The first thing that troubles me is the ''crisis of vocations''.

In March 2015, Pope Francis announced that the universal church would celebrate a Jubilee Year from 8 December 2015 to 20 November 2016, dedicated to the theme of God's mercy. The Vatican announced the pope would perform several acts to demonstrate the theme of God's mercy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-francis-homily-with-announcement-of-year-of-m Pope Francis: homily with announcement of Year of Mercy]. Official Vatican Network (13 March 2015). Retrieved on 8 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vatican spokesperson [[Greg Burke (journalist)|Greg Burke]] has said the Pope's emphasis on mercy applied to even those who are guilty of heinous crimes. One example is the case of Father Mauro Inzoli an Italian priest. The Inzoli case is one of several where Pope Francis overruled the recommendation of the Vaticans Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) reducing a sentence calling for him to be laicized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2017/02/27/pope-reduces-sanctions-against-some-paedophile-priests/|title=Pope reduces sanctions against some paedophile priests|work=Catholic Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, Francis was quoted in ''[[la Repubblica]]'' as saying (in Italian) "Those who repent obtain Gods forgiveness and take their place among the ranks of those who contemplate him, but those who do not repent and cannot be forgiven disappear. A hell doesnt exist, the disappearance of sinning souls exists. The Vatican quickly called this a reconstruction by [[Eugenio Scalfari]] rather than a faithful transcription of Francis' words.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/30/vatican-scrambles-to-clarify-popes-denial-that-hell-exists "Vatican scrambles after pope appears to deny existence of hell", by Angela Giufridda, ''The Guardian'']&lt;/ref&gt; Scalfari later said he believed the Pope denied the existence of hell, but admitted he did not take notes during their chat, and may have misremembered Francis' words, having made mistakes about him before.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/world/europe/pope-francis-hell-scalfari.html "Does Hell Exist? And Did the Pope Give an Answer?", by Jason Horowitz, ''The New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faith and evangelization===
{{See also|Evangelism}}

Pope Francis's first encyclical, "''Lumen Fidei''", was on faith and his first apostolic exhortation, "''Evangelii Gaudium''", was on the new evangelization. In both his first [[homily]] as pope and in his first address to the cardinals, Francis talked about walking in the presence of Jesus Christ and stressed the church's mission to announce him. In the audience with the cardinals, he emphasized the concept of "encounter with Jesus":
{{quote|Stimulated by the Year of Faith, all together, pastors and faithful, we will make an effort to respond faithfully to the eternal mission: to bring Jesus Christ to humanity, and to lead humanity to an encounter with Jesus Christ: the Way, the Truth, and the Life, truly present in the Church and, at the same time, in every person. This encounter makes us become new men in the mystery of [[Actual grace|Grace]], provoking in our hearts the Christian joy that is a hundredfold that given us by Christ to those who welcome Him into their lives.&lt;ref name="Greets"&gt;[http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-francis-greets-cardinal-full-text Pope Francis greets Cardinals: Full text], Vatican Today 15 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his homily, he stressed that "if we do not profess Jesus Christ, things go wrong. We may become a charitable [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]], but not the Church, the [[Bride of Christ|Bride of the Lord]]." He went on to teach that "When we do not profess Jesus Christ, we profess the worldliness of the devil... when we profess Christ without the Cross, we are not disciples of the Lord, we are worldly".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/homilies/2013/documents/papa-francesco_20130314_omelia-cardinali_en.html "Missa Pro Ecclesia" With The Cardinal Electors: Homily Of The Holy Father Pope Francis] Vatican website, 14 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of rejecting "spiritual worldliness", described as a [[leitmotif]] of his teachings even before he became pope,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/commentary/otn.cfm?id=975 |title=The early signs are clear. Pope Francis is a reformer |publisher=Catholicculture.org |date=15 March 2013 |accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was emphasized in his first apostolic exhortation. Understanding this worldliness as "putting oneself at the center", he said that it is the "greatest danger for the Church, for us, who are in the Church".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=17308 "The future Pope Francis on apostolic courage and the danger of 'spiritual worldliness'"], ''Catholic Culture'', 14 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, in October 2013, during a notable interview with the founder of ''[[la Repubblica]]'' newspaper [[Eugenio Scalfari]], Francis said: "I believe in God, not in a Catholic God, there is no Catholic God", and "[[Proselytism]] is solemn nonsense, it makes no sense. We need to get to know each other, listen to each other and improve our knowledge of the world around us".&lt;ref name="Scalfari"&gt;{{cite news |last=Scalfari |first=Eugenio |authorlink=Eugenio Scalfari |title=The Pope: how the Church will change |url=http://www.repubblica.it/cultura/2013/10/01/news/pope_s_conversation_with_scalfari_english-67643118/ |newspaper=[[la Repubblica]] |date=1 October 2013 |accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 June 2015, Pope Francis issued a [[papal encyclical]] called ''[[Laudato si']]'' on [[climate change]], care for the environment, and sustainable development.&lt;ref name="Jim Yardley and Laurie Goodstein"/&gt; The encyclical, although dated 24 May 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Francis: Encyclicals |url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/index.html#encyclicals |publisher=Holy See |accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was officially made public on 18 June 2015. The encyclical sets apart the basic human needs and appetites. Francis considers that the former are small and non-negotiable, and that the latter are potentially unlimited. Although he asks for the use of [[renewable energy]] instead of conventional fuels, he thinks that it would not be enough unless society turns down the unlimited appetites of consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/18/guardian-view-on-laudato-si-pope-francis-cultural-revolution|title= The Guardian view on Laudato Si': Pope Francis calls for a cultural revolution|date= 18 June 2015|publisher= The Guardian|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project was opposed by Vatican conservatives, Catholic conservatives, and the US evangelical movement.&lt;ref name="climate"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/27/pope-francis-edict-climate-change-us-rightwing|title= Pope Francis's edict on climate change will anger deniers and US churches|first= John|last= Vidal|date= 27 December 2014|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the encyclical, Francis states "The Earth, our home, is beginning to look like an immense pile of filth."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/18/pope-francis-encyclical-extract Pope Francis: The Earth, our home, is beginning to look like an immense pile of filth].

As he prepared for the encyclical, Francis sponsored a [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]] summit meeting in April 2015 that focused on the relationships connecting poverty, economic development, and climate change. The meeting included presentations and discussions by scientists, religious leaders, and economists. The [[United Nations]] secretary general, [[Ban Ki-moon]], who is urging world leaders to approve a climate-change accord in Paris at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in December, delivered the keynote address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vatican official calls for moral awakening on global warming |first=Stephanie|last=Kirchgaessner |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/28/vatican-climate-change-summit-to-highlight-moral-duty-for-action |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=28 April 2015 |accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church has always had the honor of this preferential option for the poor. At the Second Vatican Council the Church was redefined as the People of God and this idea really took off at the Second Conference of the Latin-American bishops in Medelln.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergoglio's opposition focused on the [[Montoneros]], a terrorist group similar to the European [[Red Brigades]] that caused nearly 6,000 deaths. Montoneros claimed that they ascribed to liberation theology, and sought support from the Church. Bosca considers that Bergoglio's opposition to the liberation theology "wasn't opposition to liberation theology in itself or the option for the poor", but opposition to the possible official Catholic support to the Montoneros.&lt;ref name=Allen2013/&gt;

Despite his caution about elements of liberation theology, Francis met with [[Gustavo Gutirrez]], who is usually regarded as its founder. Gutirrez had co-authored a book with [[Gerhard Ludwig Mller]], prefect of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]]. The Vatican's semiofficial newspaper ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' said at the time that the liberation theology should not continue to be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/liberation-theology-finds-new-welcome-in-pope-francis-vatican/2013/09/09/5265002e-198a-11e3-80ac-96205cacb45a_story.html|title= Liberation theology finds new welcome in Pope Francis' Vatican|first= Alessandro|last= Speciale|date= 9 September 2013|publisher= The Washington Post|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his papacy, Pope Francis has been a vocal opponent of both the practice and legality of abortion. In May 2013, Francis unexpectedly participated in Italy's [[pro-life]] march in Rome, asking its participants to protect human life "from the moment of conception".&lt;ref name="fivemyths"/&gt; Also, as the mostly Catholic country of Ireland was preparing legislation to legalize abortion, Francis sent a message to the Irish asking them to protect the lives of both the unborn and vulnerable people.&lt;ref name="fivemyths"&gt;{{cite web|last=Doino Jr. |first=William |url=http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/2013/07/five-myths-about-pope-francis/william-doino-jr|title=Five Myths About Pope Francis |publisher=First Things |date=22 July 2013 |accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in May 2013, during a Wednesday audience Francis officially blessed the pro-life march in [[Szczecin]], Poland, one of Europe's largest pro-life events and, speaking in Italian, encouraged the Poles to defend the unborn. He maintained that human life should be respected all the way from conception to natural death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wpolityce.pl/wydarzenia/53620-papiez-pozdrowil-organizatorow-marszu-dla-zycia-ze-szczecina-niech-ta-inicjatywa-przypomina-wszystkim-o-potrzebie-szacunku-dla-zycia|title=Papie pozdrowi organizatorw Marszu dla ycia ze Szczecina.

Francis also thought, as a Cardinal, that the church should support those women who carry on with their pregnancy despite being [[single parent]]s, rejecting the option to abort.

During the [[Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy]], Francis "grant to all priests, in virtue of their ministry, the faculty to absolve those who have committed the sin of procured abortion", a provision which he extended indefinitely in his Apostolic Letter ''Misericordia et Misera'' issued on 20 November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_letters/documents/papa-francesco-lettera-ap_20161120_misericordia-et-misera.html Misericordia et Misera], paragraph 12, published 20 November 2016, accessed 20 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Francis appealed to all priests to grant forgiveness to women who had undergone an abortion, as well as anyone who had been involved in completing the procedure. While Francis reiterated that the sin of abortion (an act punishable with automatic excommunication) is "a grave sin", he affirmed that "there is no sin that God's mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Povoledo|first1=Elisabetta|last2=Stack|first2=Liam|title=Pope Francis Extends Priests' Ability to Forgive Abortion|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/world/europe/pope-francis-abortion-priests.html?_r=0|accessdate=3 March 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/21/europe/pope-francis-absolve-abortion/index.html|title=Pope extends power to forgive abortion|first1=Tim |last1=Hume|first2=Cristiana |last2=Moisescu|first3=Daniel |last3=Burke|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kate D'Annunzio, of [[Rachel's Vineyard]], a [[pro-life]] group which ministers to women who have experienced abortions, said that Francis had clarified that priests have the ability to both forgive abortions and welcome women back into the church, stating; "The Church has had the ability to forgive these women, but many of these women had difficulty forgiving themselves. This outreach by the Pope is saying 'Don't isolate yourselves, come back to the church.'"&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Jon O'Brien, the president of U.S. [[pro-choice]] Catholic dissident advocacy group [[Catholics for Choice]], praised the pope's effort, and said "it showed that Francis understood the deep chasm that exists between ordinary Catholics {{en dash}} who turn to abortion and birth control with the same frequency as people of other faiths {{en dash}} and their clergy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirchgaessner|first1=Stephanie|title=Pope Francis cements priests' power to forgive abortion|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/21/pope-francis-makes-priests-ability-to-absolve-abortion-permanent-church-forgiveness-sin|accessdate=3 March 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ordination of women===
{{See also|Catholic Church doctrine on the ordination of women}}
Francis has often spoken about the importance of [[women in the Catholic Church]]. He considers that they have a special role in spreading the faith to their children and grandchildren. He also considers that, although the [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus|first witnesses]] of the [[resurrection of Jesus]] were women, their significance was ignored because in [[Jewish law]], only males are [[credible witness]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pope Francis stresses "fundamental importance" of women in Catholic Church|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/04/03/uk-pope-women-idUKBRE9320L120130403 |accessdate=21 April 2013|publisher=Reuters |last=O'Leary|first=Naomi|date=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Thomas C.|title=Francis talks about women and the faith|url=http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/francis-talks-about-women-and-faith|accessdate=21 April 2013|publisher=[[National Catholic Reporter]]|date=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis has addressed the subject of the [[ordination of women]] a number of times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Audience: The fundamental role of women in the Church|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2013/04/03/audience:_the_fundamental_role_of_women_in_the_church_/en1-679206|accessdate=21 April 2013|publisher=[[Vatican Radio]]|date=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis has ruled out the possibility of female priests, stating that this has been the longtime stance of the Church, and that "[[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] made the Church's stance [[Ordinatio Sacerdotalis|definitive]]. The door is closed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sydneycatholic.org/news/latest_news/2013/2013731_119.shtml|title= Pope Francis Talks to Press About Benedict XVI, Vatican Bank and 'Gay Lobby'|date= 13 July 2013|publisher= Catholic Communications, [[Sydney Archdiocese]]|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis ruled out female cardinals in December 2013.&lt;ref name="CSN16/12/2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/barbara-boland/pope-francis-there-will-be-no-women-cardinals|title=Pope Francis: There Will Be No Women Cardinals|work=[[CNS News]]|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Francis has been noncommittal about whether women should lead more in administration and pastoral activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/29/pope-francis-woman-from-rib-avoids-pledge-reform-catholic-church|title=Pope Francis jokes 'woman was from a rib' as he avoids vow to reform church|first=John|last=Hooper|work=the Guardian|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erin Saiz Hanna of the [[Women's Ordination Conference]] has accused Francis of a [[selective use of evidence]]. She mentioned that the [[Pontifical Biblical Commission]] had once concluded that there were no scriptural or theological problems with ordaining women, and cited the attitude of Jesus towards women and their leadership in the [[Early Christianity|early church]]. She also suggested that his rejection to the ordination of women may be at odds with his tolerance of [[gay priests]], mentioned in the same interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.womensordination.org/content/view/453/42/ |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130807183208/http://www.womensordination.org/content/view/453/42/ |archivedate= 7 August 2013|title= Pope Francis slams door on women's ordination|author= Erin Saiz Hanna|date= 29 July 2013|publisher= Women's Ordination Conference|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clergy===
[[File:Saludo en el Vaticano.JPG|thumb|Bishop Gabriel Barba and Pope Francis]]
Francis has criticized the perceived hunger for power of some sectors of the curia, which come at the expense of a proper religious life. He thinks that gossip is a danger to the reputation of people, and that the presence of cliques within organizations is a threat to both the individual and the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.salon.com/2014/12/22/pope_francis_slams_vatican_clergy_suffers_from_spiritual_alzheimers/|title= Pope Francis slams Vatican: Clergy suffers from "spiritual Alzheimer's"|first= Joanna|last= Rothkopf|date= 22 December 2014|publisher= Salon|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis thinks that priests should be in contact with the people as much as possible and avoid isolation. He also suggests that priests should encourage people to be optimistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thecatholictelegraph.com/pope-francis-priests-should-be-shepherds-living-with-the-smell-of-the-sheep/13439|title= Pope Francis: Priests should be 'shepherds living with the smell of the sheep'|first= Carol|last= Glatz|date= |publisher= The Catholic Telegraph|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been supported by Rome bishops, priests, deacons, and seminarians from the English-speaking world who attended the second international conference of the Confraternities of Catholic Clergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2015/01/14/priests_answer_the_popes_call_to_evangelisation/1118154|title= International Clergy Conference participants commit themselves to Pope Francis' call to evangelisation|date= 14 January 2015|publisher= Vatican Radio|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, Pope Francis approved the excommunication of Australian priest Greg Reynolds, the first during Francis's papacy. Reynolds was accused of heresy and sacrilegious treatment of the consecrated host. His public preaching contradicting church teaching was also referenced in the letter of excommunication. A letter sent by the Archbishop of Melbourne, [[Denis Hart]], to the priests of his diocese cited Reynolds's support for the ordination of women and "his public celebration of the Eucharist when he did not hold faculties to act publicly as a priest". Reynolds said that his support of [[same-sex marriage]] was also a factor, though not mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allen |first=John L. |url=http://ncronline.org/news/global/australian-priest-advocate-womens-ordination-excommunicated |title=Australian priest, advocate for women's ordination excommunicated |publisher=National Catholic Reporter  |date=10 August 2012 |accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases]], Francis created the [[Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors]]. In the past, priests who committed abuses were removed by bishops, but bishops were rarely held accountable. This tribunal was created to prevent cover-ups of abuse cases; offenders would be dealt with by the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/06/10/pope-francis-approves-a-new-process-for-governing-bishop-accountability-in-abuse-cases/|title= Pope Francis approves new tribunal to judge bishops accused of covering up sex abuse|author1=Michelle Boorstein  |author2=Abby Ohlheiser |lastauthoramp=yes |date= 10 June 2015|publisher= The Washington Post|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Blaine, president of the organization [[Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests]], considered that it may not be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/11665254/Pope-Francis-creates-Vatican-tribunal-to-judge-bishops-accused-of-covering-up-sex-abuse.html|title= Pope Francis creates Vatican tribunal to judge bishops accused of covering up sex abuse|first= Nick|last= Squires|date= 10 June 2015|publisher= The Telegraph|accessdate=12 August 2015|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Priestly celibacy====
As a cardinal, Bergoglio's views regarding the [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|celibacy of priests]] were recorded in the book ''[[On Heaven and Earth]]'', a record of conversations conducted with [[Abraham Skorka]], a Buenos Aires rabbi and rector of the [[Latin American Rabbinical Seminary]].&lt;ref name="gibson"&gt;Gibson, David, [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/03/20/pope-francis-celibacy-sex-abuse/2004151/ "Book reveals new pope's views on celibacy, abuse, crisis"], USA Today (from Religion News Service), 20 March 2013, Retrieved 21 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He says that celibacy is a matter of discipline rather than faith, and that tradition and experience would advise to keep it.&lt;ref name="celibacy"&gt;Connor, Tracy, [http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/20/17386717-pope-francis-spoke-of-being-dazzled-by-girl-possible-change-of-celibacy-rule?lite "Pope Francis spoke of being 'dazzled' by girl, possible change of celibacy rule"], NBC News, 21 March 2013, Retrieved 21 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that the Byzantine, Ukrainian, Russian, and Greek Catholic Churches allow married men to be ordained priests, but not bishops.&lt;ref name="celibacy"/&gt;{{efn|Both in the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] and in the [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]], married men can be ordained to the priesthood, but priests cannot marry after having been ordained.

Reese]], also a Jesuit, praised Bergoglio's use of conditional language.&lt;ref name="gibson"/&gt; He said that phrases like "for the moment" and "for now" are "not the kind of qualifications one normally hears when bishops and cardinals discuss celibacy."&lt;ref name="gibson"/&gt;

In an interview on 28 July 2013, when discussing homosexuals (both in general and their place in the clergy) and answering a question as to whether there was a "gay lobby" in the Vatican, the pontiff said, "If someone is gay and is searching for the Lord and has good will, then who am I to judge him?

===Religious persecution===
Francis condemned persecution of religious minorities in [[Iraq]] including [[Persecution of Christians by ISIL|some Christian victims]]. He did not mention the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] specifically but is believed to have referred to it. Francis mentioned children dying of hunger and thirst, kidnapped women, massacres, and violence of all kinds. In the opinion of Francis war and hatred cannot be carried out in the name of God. Francis thanked brave people bringing aid to those driven from their homes.

===Capital punishment and life imprisonment===
Pope Francis proposed the abolition of both [[capital punishment]] and [[life imprisonment]] in a meeting with representatives of the [[International Association of Penal Law]]. He thinks that states should find another way to protect people from aggression, and includes deaths caused by [[police brutality]] and [[extrajudicial punishment]]. He affirmed that the Church accepts it when there are no other options to protect the people, but considers that nowadays such cases may be minimal or even nonexistent. He also thinks that life imprisonment, recently removed from the Vatican penal code, is just a variation of the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1404377.htm|archive-url= https://archive.is/20141024002736/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1404377.htm|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 24 October 2014|title= Pope Francis calls for abolishing death penalty and life imprisonment|author= Francis X.

===Ecumenism with other Christians===
In October 2013, during the above-mentioned interview with Eugenio Scalfari, Francis said: "I believe in God, not in a Catholic God, there is no Catholic God".&lt;ref name="Scalfari"/&gt; In another interview with ''[[La Stampa]]'', Pope Francis emphasized his commitment to [[ecumenism]], stating: "For me, ecumenism is a priority. Today, we have the ecumenism of blood. In some countries they kill Christians because they [[cross necklace|wear a cross]] or have a Bible, and before killing them they don't ask if they're Anglicans, Lutherans, Catholics or Orthodox.

He doesn't care if they are Evangelicals, or Orthodox, Lutherans, Catholics or Apostolic... he doesn't care! They are Christians. And that blood (of martyrdom) unites.

====Independent Catholicism====
In October 2014, Pope Francis met for the first time with a delegation of the [[Old Catholic Church]]'s Bishops' Conference of the [[Union of Utrecht (Old Catholic)|Union of Utrecht]], led by the Archbishop of Utrecht and President of the International Old Catholic Bishops Conference [[Joris Vercammen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-francis-reaches-out-to-schismatic-old-catholic-church-28251/|title=Pope Francis reaches out to schismatic Old Catholic Church|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope reflected on the shared ecumenical journey of the two churches since their 18th-century schism over the issue of [[papal primacy]]. The Pope called for Catholics and [[Independent Catholicism|Independent Catholics]] to "persevere in dialogue and to walk, pray and work together in a deeper spirit of conversion" and said there are "many areas in which Catholics and Old Catholics can collaborate in tackling the profound spiritual crisis affecting individuals and societies, especially in Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2014/10/30/pope_meets_with_leaders_of_old_catholic_bishops_conference/1109760|title=Pope meets with leaders of Old Catholic Bishops Conference|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-meets-with-leaders-of-old-catholic-bishops-co|title=Pope meets with leaders of Old Catholic Bishops Conference|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2014/october/documents/papa-francesco_20141030_vescovi-veterocattolici.html|title=To a delegation of the Old Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Union of Utrecht (30 October 2014) - Francis |publisher=Holy See |accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 2017, Pope Francis participated in an ecumenical prayer service in Cairo, Egypt, with Pope Theodoros II, Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria and all Africa, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, and Coptic Orthodox Pope Tawadros II.  This historic event appears to be the first time that the three Christian popes and the ecumenical patriarch have met together.  (Joshua J. McElwee (2017).  "In Egypt, Francis appeals for peace."

====Oriental Orthodoxy====
In May 2013, Pope Francis met with [[Pope Tawadros II of Alexandria]] in the Vatican. The meeting coincided with the 40th anniversary of the first visit by a [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] to the Vatican; when [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria]] met with [[Pope Paul VI]] on 10 May 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-francis-welcomes-egypts-coptic-orthodox-pope|title=Pope Francis welcomes Egypt's Coptic Orthodox Pope Tawadros|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis reflected on the close relationship between the Catholic Church and the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], saying that the visit "strengthens the bonds of friendship and brotherhood that already exist between the See of Peter and the See of Mark" and praised the Commission for Theological Dialogue for preparing ground for dialogue between the Catholic Church and [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches. Pope Francis also acknowledged the two churches shared beliefs in the Trinity, the divinity of Christ, Marian devotion, apostolic traditions, and the seven sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/news/international/europe/story.php?id=50996|title=Historic Meeting between Pope Francis and Coptic Patriarch, Tawadros II, Fosters Christian Unity - Europe - International - News - Catholic Online|first=Michael|last=Terheyden|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, Pope Francis sent a letter to Tawadros II, acknowledging their shared commitment to holiness and defending the dignity of human life and celebrating friendship between Catholics and Coptic Orthodox Christians. The Pope said, "we are able even now to make visible the communion uniting us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/we-have-a-common-witness-pope-francis-tells-coptic-orthodox-patriarch-43850/|title=We have a common witness, Pope Francis tells Coptic Orthodox patriarch|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aleteia.org/2016/05/11/blood-and-water-unite-catholics-and-copts-pope-francis-tells-egyptian-church/|title=Blood and Water Unite Catholics and Copts, Pope Francis Tells Egyptian Church|date=11 May 2016|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, Pope Francis met with [[Ignatius Aphrem II|Moran Mor Ignatius Aphrem II]], [[List of Syriac Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch|Patriarch]] of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2015/06/16/pope_francis_to_receive_syrian_orthodox_patriarch/1151885|title=Pope Francis to receive Syrian Orthodox Patriarch|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two primates discussed their desire to work toward [[full communion]] between their two churches, stating that Antioch and Rome are the only two Apostolic Sees where St. Peter the Apostle had preached. They also expressed an eagerness to celebrate Easter on a common date, as Catholics and Oriental Orthodox have separate days for Easter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/francis-chronicles/pope-orthodox-patriarch-express-commitment-unity|title=Pope, Orthodox patriarch express commitment for unity|date=19 June 2015|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his [[List of pastoral visits of Pope Francis outside Italy#Armenia (24 to 26 June 2016)|papal visit to Armenia in 2016]], Pope Francis prayed inside [[Etchmiadzin Cathedral]], the mother church of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] and the oldest state-built church in the world, alongside the [[Catholicos of All Armenians]], [[Karekin II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/francis-and-armenian-orthodox-patriarch-say-churches-are-one-prayer-action|title=Francis and Armenian Orthodox patriarch say churches are one in prayer, action|date=26 June 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the prayer service, the Pope asked for and received a blessing from Catholicos Karekin II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americamagazine.org/content/dispatches/pope-francis-prays-full-unity-armenian-apostolic-church|title=Pope Francis Prays for Full Unity with Armenian Apostolic Church|date=26 June 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope spoke about the Christian faith of the Armenian people and how [[Armenia]] became the first nation to accept Christianity as its official religion, even while persecutions under Emperor [[Diocletian]] were prevalent in the Roman Empire. The Pope also gave thanks for the relationship between the Catholic Church and the Armenian Apostolic Church and the steps they have taken "for the sake of coming to share fully in the Eucharistic banquet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2016/06/24/pope_francis_prays_in_armenian_apostolic_cathedral/1239643|title=Pope Francis prays in Armenian Apostolic Cathedral|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anglicanism====
[[Gregory Venables]], [[Anglican Bishop of Argentina]] and former Primate of the [[Anglican Church of the Southern Cone of America]], said that Cardinal Bergoglio had told him very clearly that the [[personal ordinariate]]s established within the Catholic Church for groups of former Anglicans was "quite unnecessary" and that the Catholic Church needed Anglicans as Anglicans. A spokesman for the ordinariates said the words were those of Venables, not the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Affairs |first=Religious |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/the-pope/9933614/Pope-Francis-dismissed-Anglican-branch-as-quite-unnecessary.html |title=The Telegraph newspaper: Pope Francis 'dismissed Anglican branch as quite unnecessary', 31 May 2013 |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date= 15 March 2013|accessdate=23 June 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Francis met for the first time the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Justin Welby]], when he visited the Vatican, on 14 June 2013.

It was presented during Archbishop Beach's enthronement, which took place at the Church of the Apostles in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], on 9 October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglican.ink/article/papal-greetings-newest-anglican-archbishop#sthash.8JhUVxDn.j016j3Ms.dpbs|title=Papal greetings for newest Anglican archbishop|publisher=|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lutheranism====
On 31 October 2016, Pope Francis commemorated the 499th anniversary of the [[Reformation]] with Lutherans in Sweden. This event opened the 500th year{{efn|31 October 2016 is the 499th anniversary of the start of the Reformation.}} since the Reformation began with Martin Luther posting his [[Ninety-Five Theses]] in [[Wittenberg]] in 1517.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/10/28/499587801/pope-francis-reaches-out-to-honor-the-man-who-splintered-christianity|title=The Pope Commemorates The Reformation That Split Western Christianity|author=Paggioli, Sylvia|date=|work=npr.org|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope visited the 950 year old [[Lund Cathedral]], located in Sweden's southernmost and originally Danish province of [[Scania]]. He celebrated an ecumenical liturgy together with the president of the [[Lutheran World Federation]] Bishop Dr. [[Munib Younan]]. Pope Francis expressed his shared desire with leaders of the [[Church of Sweden]] to achieve full communion, but said more ecumenical work needed to be done in order to work towards communion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/world/europe/pope-francis-in-sweden-urges-catholic-lutheran-reconciliation.html|title=Pope Francis, in Sweden, Urges Catholic-Lutheran Reconciliation|first=Christina|last=Anderson|date=31 October 2016|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two churches called for focusing on what unites their faith rather than what separates them from each other (Pope Francis previously made a similar treaty with the Orthodox Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2016/01/25/pope-francis-to-visit-sweden-for-reformation-commemoration/|title=Pope Francis to visit Sweden for Reformation commemoration - CatholicHerald.co.uk|date=25 January 2016|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lutheranworld.org/|title=The Lutheran World Federation|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The following day the Pope conducted a Catholic mass at a football stadium in [[Malm]].&lt;ref&gt;Both the Ecumenical commemoration and the Catholical mass were aired live and commentated at Swedish national, commercial free, television distributor, SVT&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Mark Hanson]], then presiding bishop of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA), greeted the news of Bergoglio's election with a public statement that praised his work with [[Lutheran]]s in Argentina.&lt;ref name="lutherans"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130325082649/http://www.elca.org/Who-We-Are/Our-Three-Expressions/Churchwide-Organization/Communication-Services/News/Releases.aspx?a=5281 "New pope has ties to Lutherans, says ELCA presiding bishop,"] ELCA news service, 13 March 2013, Retrieved 16 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Methodism ====
On 14 December 2014, Pope Francis became the first pope to host a [[General of The Salvation Army]], the international leader of the [[Holiness movement|Evangelical Methodist]] denomination [[The Salvation Army]], in a private audience in the Vatican when he met with [[Andr Cox]]. The pope said that "Catholics and Salvationists, together with other Christians, recognise that those in need have a special place in God's heart", as a result they often "meet at the same peripheries of society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-says-salvationists-and-catholics-meet-at-peri|title=Pope says Salvationists and Catholics meet at peripheries of society|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his [[Pope Francis' visit to the Philippines|papal visit to the Philippines]] in 2015, the Pope met with [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Chief Justice]] [[Reynato Puno]], a [[United Methodist]] layman, along with nine other religious leaders and peace advocates to discuss humanitarian relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.umc.org/news-and-media/united-methodist-layman-to-meet-pope-francis |title=United Methodist layman to meet Pope Francis &amp;#124; The United Methodist Church |website=Umc.org |date= |accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Pope Francis met with members of the [[World Methodist Council]], the Methodist Council of Europe, and the [[Methodist Church in Britain]], who were in Rome for the opening of the Methodist Ecumenical Office there.&lt;ref name="radiovaticana.va"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2016/04/07/catholics,_methodists_walking_together_in_service_to_world/1220987|title=Catholics and Methodists: Walking together in service to the world|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope called for Catholics and Methodists to unite in their Christian beliefs and in service to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cruxnow.com/church/2016/04/08/catholics-and-methodists-can-learn-from-one-another-pope-says/|title=Catholics and Methodists can learn from one another, pope says|date=8 April 2016|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Francis referred to Catholics and Methodists as "truly brothers and sisters" and, reflecting on the words of the Anglican priest and founder of Methodism [[John Wesley]] in his ''Letter to a Roman Catholic'', quoted "if we cannot as yet think alike in all things, at least we may love alike."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2016/04/07/pope_francis_addresses_methodist_guests_full_text/1220885|title=Pope Francis addresses Methodist guests: full text|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="radiovaticana.va"/&gt;

Also in 2016, Pope Francis met with Gottfried Locher, the President of the [[Federation of Swiss Protestant Churches]] to speak about "ecumenism and Protestantism in Europe."

====Evangelicalism====
[[Evangelical Christian]] leaders, including Argentine [[Luis Palau]], welcomed the news of Bergoglio's election as Pope based on his relations with [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Protestants]], noting that Bergoglio's financial manager for the Archdiocese of Buenos Aires was an Evangelical Christian whom Bergoglio refers to as a friend.&lt;ref name="evangelicals"&gt;Stefan, Melissa, [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2013/march-web-only/luis-palau-pope-francis-drinks-mate-evangelicals-bergoglio.html?paging=off "Luis Palau: Why it matters that Pope Francis drinks mate with Evangelicals]," ''Christianity Today'', 14 March 2013, Retrieved 15 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Palau recounted how Bergoglio would not only relax and "drink [[Mate (drink)|mate]]" with that friend, but would also read the Bible and pray with him, based on what Bergoglio called a relationship of friendship and trust.&lt;ref name="evangelicals" /&gt; Palau described Bergoglio's approach to relationships with Evangelicals as one of "building bridges and showing respect, knowing the differences, but majoring on what we can agree on: on the divinity of Jesus, his virgin birth, his resurrection, the second coming."&lt;ref name="evangelicals" /&gt; As a result of Bergoglio's election, Palau predicted that "tensions will be eased."&lt;ref name="evangelicals" /&gt;

Juan Pablo Bongarr, president of the Argentine Bible Society, recounted that Bergoglio not only met with Evangelicals and prayed with them, he also asked them to pray ''for'' him.&lt;ref name="weber"&gt;Weber, Jeremy, [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2013/march-web-only/argentine-evangelicals-say-bergoglio-as-pope-francis-is-ans.html "Argentine Evangelicals say Bergoglio as Pope Francis 'answer to our prayers'"], ''Christianity Today'', 14 March 2013, Retrieved 16 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Bongarr noted that Bergoglio would frequently end a conversation with the request, "Pastor, pray for me."&lt;ref name="weber" /&gt; Additionally, Bongarr told the story of a weekly worship meeting of charismatic pastors in Buenos Aires, which Bergoglio attended: "He mounted the platform and called for pastors to pray for him. He knelt in front of nearly 6,000 people, and [the Protestant leaders there] laid hands and prayed."&lt;ref name="weber" /&gt;

Other Evangelical Christian leaders agreed that Bergoglio's relationships in Argentina made him "situated to better understand Protestantism" than had his predecessor Pope Benedict, "who often referred to Protestantism as a 'sect' of Christianity".&lt;ref name="christianitytoday"&gt;Moon, Ruth, [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2013/march-web-only/why-pope-francis-excites-most-evangelical-leaders-bergoglio.html "Why Pope Francis excites (most) Evangelical leaders,"] Christianity Today, 14 March 2013, Retrieved 15 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that the divide between Catholicism and Protestantism is often present among members of the same families in Argentina, and is therefore an extremely important human issue, Evangelical author Chris Castaldo said that Francis could set the tone for more compassionate conversations among families about the differences between Protestantism and Catholicism.&lt;ref name="christianitytoday" /&gt;

====Mormonism====
In November 2014, three top [[Mormonism|Mormon]] leaders attended the Vatican's "Humanum: An International Interreligious Colloquium on the Complementarity of Man and Woman"; the [[Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)|Presiding Bishop]] of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] [[Grald Causs]], the First Counselor in the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] of the LDS Church [[Henry B.

===Interfaith dialogue===
[[File:Pope Francis visit Bethlehem.jpg|thumb|Pope Francis in [[Bethlehem]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], 25 May 2014]]
Bergoglio has written about his commitment to open and respectful [[interfaith dialogue]] as a way for all parties engaged in that dialogue to learn from one another.&lt;ref name="interfaith"&gt;Lefebure, Leo D., [http://www.parliamentofreligions.org/news/index.php/tag/rabbi-abraham-skorka/ "Pope Francis and Interreligious Relations,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017165755/http://www.parliamentofreligions.org/news/index.php/tag/rabbi-abraham-skorka/ |date=17 October 2013 }} parliamentofreligions.org, Retrieved 16 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 book that records his conversations with Rabbi [[Abraham Skorka]], ''[[On Heaven and Earth]]'', Bergoglio said:

{{quote|Dialogue is born from an attitude of respect for the other person, from a conviction that the other person has something good to say. It assumes that there is room in the heart for the person's point of view, opinion, and proposal. Dialogue entails a cordial reception, not a prior condemnation. In order to dialogue it is necessary to know how to lower the defenses, open the doors of the house, and offer human warmth.&lt;ref name="interfaith"/&gt;}}

Religious leaders in Buenos Aires have mentioned that Bergoglio promoted interfaith ceremonies at the [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral]].&lt;ref name="ceremonies"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/03/18/argentine-jews-hope-pope-francis-will-continue-interfaith-dialogue-promoted-as/ "Argentine Jews praise Pope Francis for interfaith dialogue"], foxnews.com (from AP), 18 March 2013, Retrieved 19 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in November 2012 he brought leaders of the Jewish, Muslim, Evangelical, and Orthodox Christian faiths together to pray for a peaceful solution to the [[List of modern conflicts in the Middle East|Middle East conflicts]].&lt;ref name="ceremonies" /&gt; Rabbi [[Alejandro Avruj]] praised Bergoglio's interest in interfaith dialogue and his commitment to mend religious divisions.&lt;ref name="ceremonies" /&gt;

Shortly after his election, the pope called for more interreligious dialogue as a way of "building bridges" and establishing "true links of friendship between all people".&lt;ref name="interfaithdialogue" /&gt; He added that it was crucial "to intensify outreach to nonbelievers, so that the differences which divide and hurt us may never prevail".&lt;ref name="interfaithdialogue" /&gt; He said that his title of "pontiff" means "builder of bridges", and that it was his wish that "the dialogue between us should help to build bridges connecting all people, in such a way that everyone can see in the other not an enemy, not a rival, but a brother or sister to be welcomed and embraced."&lt;ref name="interfaithdialogue" /&gt;

On 24 May 2014, Pope Francis arrived in [[Jordan]], at the start of a tour of the Middle East, "aiming to boost ties with Muslims and Jews as well as easing an age-old rift within Christianity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/05/pope-francis-begins-middle-east-tour-201452431846597709.html |title=Pope Francis begins Middle East tour  Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2016 survey, Francis was viewed favourably by almost two thirds of Jews, as well as majorities of Protestants and the irreligious; minorities of Buddhists and Muslims had favourable views of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wyatt|first1=Caroline|title=Pope Francis's reforms polarise the Vatican|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35869656|accessdate=27 March 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judaism====
[[File:Franciscus kotel.jpg|thumb|Francis praying at the [[Western Wall]] in [[Jerusalem]] on his 2014 visit to the Holy Land]]
Bergoglio has close ties to the [[History of the Jews in Argentina|Jewish community of Argentina]], and attended [[Rosh Hashanah]] (Jewish new year) services in 2007 at a synagogue in Buenos Aires. He told the Jewish congregation during his visit that he went to the synagogue to examine his heart, "like a pilgrim, together with you, my elder brothers".&lt;ref name="jta"&gt;{{cite news|title=New pope, Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina, has Jewish connections|url= http://www.jta.org/2013/03/13/news-opinion/world/new-pope-jorge-mario-bergoglio-of-argentina-has-jewish-connections|accessdate=15 May 2015|publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1994 [[AMIA bombing]] of a [[Jewish Community Center]] that killed 85 people, Bergoglio was the first public figure to sign a petition condemning the attack and calling for justice. Jewish community leaders around the world noted that his words and actions "showed solidarity with the Jewish community" in the aftermath of this attack.&lt;ref name="jta" /&gt;

A former head of the [[World Jewish Congress]], [[Israel Singer]], reported that he worked with Bergoglio in the early 2000s, distributing aid to the poor as part of a joint JewishCatholic program called "[[Tzedak]]". Singer noted that he was impressed with Bergoglio's modesty, remembering that "if everyone sat in chairs with handles [arms], he would sit in the one without."&lt;ref name="jta" /&gt; Bergoglio also co-hosted a ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' memorial ceremony at the [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral]] in 2012,&lt;ref name="jta" /&gt; and joined a group of clerics from a number of different religions to light candles in a 2012 synagogue ceremony on the occasion of the Jewish festival of [[Hanukkah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.algemeiner.com/2013/03/14/new-popes-relationship-with-jews-lit-menorah-during-2012-hanukkah-celebration-in-argentina-video/ "New Pope's Relationship with Jews: Lit menorah during 2012 Hanukkah celebration in Argentina" (VIDEO)], algemeiner.com, 16 March 2013, Retrieved 16 March 2013.

====Islam====
[[Islam in Argentina|Muslim leaders in Buenos Aires]] welcomed the news of Bergoglio's election as pope, noting that he "always showed himself as a friend of the Islamic community", and a person whose position is "pro-dialogue".&lt;ref name="islam"&gt;[http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/126369/pope-francis-a-friend-of-the-islamic-community "Pope Francis 'a friend of the Islamic community"], Buenos Aires Herald, 14 March 2013. Retrieved 14 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; They praised Bergoglio's close ties with Muslim groups and noted his comments when Pope Benedict's 2006 [[Regensburg lecture]] was interpreted by many as denigrating Islam. According to them, Bergoglio immediately distanced himself from Benedict's language and said that statements which provoked outrage with Muslims would "serve to destroy in 20 seconds the careful construction of a relationship with Islam that Pope John Paul II built over the last 20 years."&lt;ref name="muslim"&gt;Ghosh, Palash, [http://www.ibtimes.com/pope-francis-friend-muslims-1130225 "Pope Francis: A friend to Muslims?"], ''International Business Times,'' 15 March 2013, Retrieved 16 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergoglio visited both a mosque and an Islamic school in Argentina; visits that the Director for the Diffusion of Islam, Sheik Mohsen Ali, called actions that strengthened the relationship between the Catholic and Islamic communities.&lt;ref name="islam" /&gt; Sumer Noufouri, Secretary General of the Islamic Center of the Argentine Republic (CIRA), added that for Muslims, Bergoglio's past actions make his election as pope a cause of "joy and expectation of strengthening dialogue between religions".&lt;ref name="islam" /&gt; Noufouri said that the relationship between CIRA and Bergoglio over the course of a decade had helped to build up ChristianMuslim dialogue in a way that was "really significant in the history of monotheistic relations in Argentina".&lt;ref name="islam" /&gt;

Shortly after his election, in a meeting with ambassadors from the 180 countries accredited with the Holy See, Pope Francis called for more interreligious dialogue"particularly with Islam".&lt;ref name="interfaithdialogue"&gt;Povoleto, Elisabetta, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/23/world/europe/pope-francis-urges-more-interreligious-dialogue.html?_r=0 "Pope Francis Urges More Interreligious Dialogue"], ''New York Times'', 22 March 2013, Retrieved 26 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He also expressed gratitude that "so many civil and religious leaders from the Islamic world" had attended his installation Mass.&lt;ref name="interfaithdialogue" /&gt; An editorial in the Saudi Arabian paper ''[[Saudi Gazette]]'' strongly welcomed the pope's call for increased interfaith dialogue, stressing that while the pope was "reiterating a position he has always maintained", his public call as pope for increased dialogue with Islam "comes as a breath of fresh air at a time when much of the Western world is experiencing a nasty outbreak of [[Islamophobia]]".&lt;ref name="saudigazette"&gt;[http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentid=20130325158320 "Pope's call for interfaith amity"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003020927/http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentid=20130325158320 |date=3 October 2013 }}, ''Saudi Gazette'', 25 March 2013, Retrieved 26 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[2016 Normandy church attack]], whereby two Islamic terrorists affiliated with [[ISIS]] murdered the 85-year-old Catholic priest [[Jacques Hamel]] by slitting his throat, Bergoglio made public statements saying, "It's not right to identify Islam with violence. It's not right and it's not true [...] If I speak of Islamic violence, then I have to speak of Catholic violence."&lt;ref name="bbcpape"/&gt; According to the [[BBC]], this received a French backlash on social media, as the hashtag ''#PasMonPape'' ("Not My Pope") became the number one trend on [[Twitter]] in France.&lt;ref name="bbcpape"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-36954425 | title='Not my Pope' hashtag highlights French divisions| date=2 August 2016| agency=BBC| accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Pope Francis declined to meet with [[Tenzin Gyatso]], the 14th [[Dalai Lama]], after the Dalai Lama, who was visiting Rome, had requested a papal audience. Vatican officials assured the press and Buddhist leaders that Pope Francis held the Dalai Lama "in very high regard", but was concerned that the meeting of the two spiritual leaders could jeopardize the [[ChinaHoly See relations|Vatican's efforts to improve their relationship with China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30455187|title=Pope declines Dalai Lama meeting in Rome|date=12 December 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In speaking critically of the progress of the negotiations, in October 2017 [[Joseph Zen|Cardinal Joseph Zen]], former bishop of Hong Kong, said the Pope "does not understand the Communist Party at all" and that the Chinese Communist Party government had failed to make any concessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/10/06/pope-francis-not-understand-chinese-communist-party-says-hong-kong-cardinal-joseph-zen/|title=Pope Francis does not understand the Chinese Communist Party, says Hong Kong Cardinal Joseph Zen|date=6 October 2017|last=Cheng|first=Kris|newspaper=Hong Kong Free Press|access-date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015 during the [[Holy SeeSri Lanka relations|papal visit to Sri Lanka]], Pope Francis made an unscheduled stop at a Buddhist temple in [[Colombo, Sri Lanka|Colombo]] where he was shown sacred Buddhist relics that are normally only viewed once a year, and listened to singing and devotional music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/14/pope-francis-sri-lankan-buddhist-temple|title=Pope Francis changes schedule to visit Sri Lankan Buddhist temple|date=14 January 2015|publisher=Associated Press|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier that week, Francis had met with Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Christian leaders in Sri Lanka and said "religious beliefs must never be allowed to be abused in the cause of violence and war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cruxnow.com/church/2015/01/14/pope-francis-makes-surprise-visit-to-buddhist-temple/|title=Pope Francis makes surprise visit to Buddhist temple|date=14 January 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 June 2015, dialogue between [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and Catholic religious and social leaders began in the Vatican, hosted by the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.

===Attitudes about non-believers===
Speaking to journalists and media employees on 16 March 2013, Pope Francis said he would bless everyone silently, "given that many of you do not belong to the Catholic Church, and others are not believers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Donadio|first=Rachel |title=With Blessing, Pope Shows an Openness to Other Faiths|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/world/europe/with-blessing-pope-shows-an-openness-to-other-faiths.html|accessdate=17 April 2013|publisher=New York Times|date=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his papal address on 20 March, he said the "attempt to eliminate God and the Divine from the horizon of humanity" resulted in violence, but described as well his feelings about nonbelievers: "[W]e also sense our closeness to all those men and women who, although not identifying themselves as followers of any religious tradition, are nonetheless searching for truth, goodness and beauty, the truth, goodness and beauty of God.

In September 2013, Francis wrote a letter to Italian journalist Eugenio Scalfari, saying non-believers would be forgiven by God if they followed their [[conscience]]s. Responding to a list of questions published in his newspaper by Scalfari, who is not a Catholic, Francis wrote: "you ask if the God of Christians forgives those who do not believe and who do not seek faith.

Popular [[mainstream media]] frequently portray Pope Francis either as a [[Progressivism|progressive]] papal reformer or with [[Social liberalism|liberal]], moderate values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/does-pope-francis-have-a-cunning-plan-30444898.html|title=Does Pope Francis have a cunning plan?|work=Irish Independent|first=John|last=Waters|date=20 July 2014|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican has claimed that Western news outlets often seek to portray his message with a less-doctrinal tone of papacy, in hopes of extrapolating his words to convey a more merciful and tolerant message.&lt;ref name="Achanging"&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Binelli |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/pope-francis-the-times-they-are-a-changin-20140128 |title=Pope Francis Cover Story: The Times They Are A-Changin' |work=Rolling Stone |date=28 January 2014 |accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/vatican-spokesman-media-manipulated-popes-comments-on-families/|title=Vatican spokesman: media manipulated Pope's family comments |date=7 January 2014|publisher=Catholic News Agency|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the news media, both faithful and non-believers often refer to a "honeymoon" phase in which the Pope has changed the tone on Catholic doctrines and supposedly initiated [[ecclesiastical]] reform in the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/frame_game/2013/09/pope_francis_interview_forget_homosexuality_and_birth_control_he_s_a_flaming.html |title=Pope Francis Is a Liberal |last=Saletan |first=William |author-link=William Saletan|date=19 September 2013 |website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |publisher=The Slate Group |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Luke|last=Coppen |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9112081/the-fantasy-francis/ |title=Sorry  but Pope Francis is no liberal |work=The Spectator |date=11 January 2014 |accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Loughlin |first=Michael |url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/religion/2014/01/28/catholics-urge-pope-francis-speak-out-lgbt-rights |title=Catholics Urge Pope Francis to Speak Out for LGBT Rights |work=Advocate |date=28 January 2014 |accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media systems differ, too, not only in their coverage of Francis's stances but also in how individual events are portrayed. His 2015 trip to Cuba is a prime example. During this trip, American-based AP and British-based Reuters highlighted the religious aspect of the pope's journey while Prensa Latina, the official state media agency, depicted it as a diplomatic visit. American and British media were also more likely during this trip to show Francis interacting with regular Cubans compared to the official Cuban media, which showed Francis interacting with elites most often.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomson|first=T.

{{Infobox Pope styles

| dipstyle=[[His Holiness]]
| offstyle=Your Holiness
| relstyle=Holy Father
| deathstyle=}}
The official [[Style (manner of address)|style]] of the Pope in English is ''His Holiness Pope Francis''; in Latin, ''Franciscus, Episcopus Romae''. ''Holy Father'' is another honorific often used for popes.

His full title, rarely used, is:
:''[[His Holiness]] Francis, [[Bishop of Rome]], [[Vicar of Christ|Vicar of Jesus Christ]], Successor of the [[Saint Peter|Prince of the Apostles]], [[Pontifex Maximus|Supreme]] [[Pontiff#Christianity|Pontiff]] of the Universal Church, [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of Italy, [[Metropolitan bishop|Archbishop and Metropolitan]] of the [[List of the Roman Catholic dioceses in Italy#Ecclesiastical Province of Rome|Roman]] [[Ecclesiastical province#Catholic Church|Province]], [[List of Sovereigns of the Vatican City State|Sovereign]] of the [[Vatican City]] State, [[Servant of the servants of God]].''

The best-known title, that of "Pope", does not appear in the official list of titles, but is commonly used in the titles of documents, and appears, in abbreviated form, in their signatures as "PP." standing for ''Papa'' (''Pope'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cathEncy|author=Shahan, Thomas Joseph|wstitle=Ecclesiastical Abbreviations|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year= 2013|title =Pope |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopdia Britannica]] |publisher= Encyclopdia Britannica Online|accessdate=14 April 2013|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469994/pope}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inkunabeln.ub.uni-koeln.de/vdibDevelop/handapparat/nachs_w/cappelli/cappelli.html |first=Adriano|last=Cappelli |title= Lexicon Abbreviaturarum |page=283 |date= |accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndl.go.jp/incunabula/e/glossary/glo_11.html |title=Contractions and Abbreviations |publisher=Ndl.go.jp |date=4 August 2005 |accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/Papa+Pontifex |title=What Does PP Stand For? |publisher=Acronyms.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is customary when referring to popes to translate the [[regnal name]] into local languages. Thus he is ''Papa Franciscus'' in Latin (the official language of the Holy See), ''Papa Francesco'' in Italian (the language of the Vatican), ''Papa Francisco'' in his native Spanish, and ''Pope Francis'' in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blogs.canoe.ca/parker/news/a-few-things-you-might-not-know-about-pope-francis/|title= A Few Things You Might Not Know About Pope Francis|first= Alan|last= Parker|date= 15 March 2013|work= |publisher= Toronto Sun|accessdate= 11 April 2014|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://archive.is/20140411184409/http://blogs.canoe.ca/parker/news/a-few-things-you-might-not-know-about-pope-francis/|archivedate= 11 April 2014|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appreciation===
In the [[oratorio]] [[Laudato si' (oratorio)|Laudato si']] by [[Peter Reulein]] (music) written on a [[libretto]] by [[Helmut Schlegel]] [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]], the figure of Pope Francis appears next to [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], [[Francis of Assisi]] and [[Clare of Assisi]]. In the oratorio, Pope Franziskus suggests a bridge from the crucifixion scene on [[Calvary|Golgotha]] to the suffering of the present. He emphasizes the female talent and the importance of the charism of women for church and society. The texts of the [[encyclical]] ''[[Laudato si']]'' and ''[[Evangelii gaudium]]'' were used. The motto of the [[Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy]] also plays a central role.&lt;ref name="Laudato si-score"&gt;{{cite book | last = Reulein | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Reulein | last2 = Schlegel | first2 = Helmut | authorlink2 = Helmut Schlegel | title = Laudato si' / Ein franziskanisches Magnificat | publisher = [[Patrick Dehm|Dehm Verlag]] | location = [[Limburg an der Lahn]] | year = 2016 | isbn = 978-3-943302-34-9 | page = 230 | ismn = 979-0-50226-047-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oratorio was premiered on 6 November 2016 in the [[Limburg Cathedral]].&lt;ref name="Laudato si-Liebfrauen"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.liebfrauen.net/meldung_volltext.php?si=5807238ed0bee&amp;id=57f955bfc9ddd&amp;view=&amp;lang=&amp;akt=musikkunstkultur_musikmeldungen&amp;k1=main&amp;k2=musikkunstkultur&amp;k3=musikmeldungen&amp;k4= | title = Festkonzert zum Jubilum des Referates Kirchenmusik / Laudato si'Oratorium von Peter Reulein (Urauffhrung) | publisher = [[Liebfrauen, Frankfurt]] | year = 2016 | language = German | accessdate = 25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
