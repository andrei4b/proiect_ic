==Early life==
Gates was born in [[Seattle, Washington]] on October 28, 1955. He is the son of [[William H. Gates Sr.]]{{efn|While his father was named William H. Gates II, he is now generally known as William H. Gates, Senior, to avoid confusion with his son.}} (b. 1925) and [[Mary Maxwell Gates]] (19291994). His ancestry includes [[English American|English]], [[German American|German]], [[Irish American|Irish]], and [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wargs.com/other/gates.html |title=Ancestry of Bill Gates |publisher=Wargs |accessdate=June 9, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612062031/http://www.wargs.com/other/gates.html |archivedate=June 12, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scottish Americans |publisher=Alba West |url=http://www.albawest.com/scottish-americans.html |access-date=April 29, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511172722/http://www.albawest.com/scottish-americans.html |archivedate=May 11, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for [[First Interstate BancSystem]] and the [[United Way of America|United Way]]. Gates' maternal grandfather was J.W, Maxwell, a [[National bank#United States|national bank]] president. Gates has one older sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and a younger sister, Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family, but is known as William Gates III or "Trey" because his father had the "II" suffix.{{Sfn |Manes | 1994 |p= 15}}  Early on in his life, Gates observed that his parents wanted him to pursue a law career.{{Sfn |Manes|1994|p = 47}} When Gates was young, his family regularly attended a church of the [[Congregational Christian Churches]], a [[Protestant]] [[Reformed]] denomination.&lt;ref name="Congregational 1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bill Gates: Entrepreneur and Philanthropist | url = https://books.google.com/?id=ubYgIB0TgUYC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Bill+Gates+Congregationalist#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |quote = The Gates family regularly went to services at the University Congregational Church.| first =Jeanne M | last = Lesinski |publisher=Twenty First Century Books | accessdate =March 10, 2011|isbn= 978-1-58013-570-2|date = September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Congregational 2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bill Gates Speaks: Insight from the World's Greatest Entrepreneur|url = https://books.google.com/?id=LUwu-DTwa5cC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Congregationalist++bill+gates#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |quote = The Gates family attended the University Congregational Church, where the Reverend Dale Turner was pastor. | first = Janet | last = Lowe| publisher = Wiley | accessdate=March 10, 2011|isbn= 978-0-471-40169-8|date = January 5, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Congregational 3"&gt;{{cite book| title = Something Happened: A Political and Cultural Overview of the Seventies | url =https://books.google.com/?id=tsl3EVBtdxcC&amp;pg=PA228&amp;dq=Congregationalist++bill+gates#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=Bill Gates was a member of the baby boom, born in 1955 into an upper-middle-class family near Seattle."

At 13, he enrolled in the [[Lakeside School (Seattle, Washington)|Lakeside School]], a private preparatory school.{{Sfn | Manes| 1994| p = 24}}  When Gates was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's [[rummage sale]] to buy a [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a [[General Electric]] (GE) computer for the school's students.{{Sfn |Manes|1994|p= 27}}  Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of [[tic-tac-toe]] that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he said, "There was just something neat about the machine."{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 12}}  After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] minicomputers. One of these systems was a [[PDP-10]] belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students{{snd}} Gates, [[Paul Allen]], [[Ric Weiland]], and Kent Evans{{snd}} for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.{{Sfn | Manes | 1994|p = 34}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2044825/paul-allen-spills-beans-gates-criminal-past | agency = V3 | title = Paul Allen spills the beans on Gates' criminal past | place = UK | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130312212620/http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2044825/paul-allen-spills-beans-gates-criminal-past | archivedate = March 12, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the ban, the four students offered to find bugs in [[Computer Center Corporation|CCC]]'s software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than use the system via [[Teletype]]. Subsequently, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied [[source code]] for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in [[Fortran]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], and [[machine language]]. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the company went out of business. The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in [[COBOL]], providing them computer time and royalties. After his administrators became aware of his programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with "a disproportionate number of interesting girls."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.gatesfoundation.org/media-center/speeches/2005/09/bill-gates-lakeside-school | title = Remarks by Bill Gates, co-chair | accessdate = July 13, 2013 | work = Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation&amp;nbsp; Press Room, Speeches | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130703072235/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Speeches/2005/09/Bill-Gates-Lakeside-School | archivedate = July 3, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later stated that "it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success."{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 12}}  At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called [[Traf-O-Data]], to make [[traffic counter]]s based on the [[Intel 8008]] processor.{{Sfn |Gates|1996| p= 14}}  In 1972, Bill Gates served as a congressional [[Page (assistance occupation)|page]] in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name="Schuman2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael A.

Gates did not have a definite study plan while he was a student at Harvard,{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 19}} and he spent a lot of time using the school's computers. Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen, and he joined him at [[Honeywell]] during the summer of 1974.{{Sfn |Wallace| 1993| p = 59}}  The [[MITS Altair 8800]] was released the following year. The new computer was based on the [[Intel 8080 CPU]], and Gates and Allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company.{{Sfn |Gates|1996| p= 18}}  Gates dropped out of Harvard at this time. He had talked over this decision with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much their son wanted to start his own company.{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 19}}  Gates explained his decision to leave Harvard, saying "...if things [Microsoft] hadn't worked out, I could always go back to school.  I was officially on [a] [[leave of absence|leave]] [of absence]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ4G1RtoKyI&amp;t=53 The History of Microsoft  1976] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211023447/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ4G1RtoKyI&amp;t=53 |date=February 11, 2017 }}: Bill Gates explaining that his departure from Harvard was reversible if Microsoft had failed.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Gates read the January 1975 issue of ''[[Popular Electronics]]'', which demonstrated the [[Altair 8800]], he contacted [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems]] (MITS), the creators of the new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working on a [[BASIC]] interpreter for the platform.&lt;ref name="keyevents"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Microsoft Visitor Center Student Information: Key Events in Microsoft History |url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/3/0/130dd86a-a196-4700-b577-521c4cf5cec1/key_events_in_microsoft_history.doc |publisher=Microsoft |format=.DOC |accessdate=February 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226224212/http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/3/0/130dd86a-a196-4700-b577-521c4cf5cec1/key_events_in_microsoft_history.doc |archivedate=February 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president [[Ed Roberts (computers)|Ed Roberts]] agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair [[emulator]] that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at MITS's offices in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as [[Altair BASIC]]. Paul Allen was hired into MITS,&lt;ref name="thocp1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft history |publisher=The History of Computing Project |url=http://www.thocp.net/companies/microsoft/microsoft_company.htm |accessdate=March 31, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514211138/http://www.thocp.net/companies/microsoft/microsoft_company.htm |archivedate=May 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with Allen at MITS in Albuquerque in November 1975. They named their partnership "Micro-Soft" and had their first office located in Albuquerque.&lt;ref name=thocp1 /&gt; Within a year, the hyphen was dropped, and on November 26, 1976, the trade name "Microsoft" was registered with the Office of the Secretary of the [[New Mexico|State of New Mexico]].&lt;ref name=thocp1 /&gt; Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.

Microsoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, Gates wrote an [[Open Letter to Hobbyists]] in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90 percent of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and by doing so the Altair "hobby market" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software.{{Sfn |Manes|1994|p=81}}  This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.&lt;ref name="thocp1" /&gt; The company moved from Albuquerque to its new home in [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]], Washington, on January 1, 1979.&lt;ref name="keyevents" /&gt;

During Microsoft's early years, all employees had broad responsibility for the company's business.  Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, according to Bill Gates' own claims, he personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.&lt;ref name="waterloo"&gt;{{cite speech|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2005/10-13Waterloo.aspx |last=Gates |first=William 'Bill' |title=Remarks |date=October 13, 2005 |location=Waterloo, [[Ontario|ON]] |accessdate=March 31, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406130809/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2005/10-13Waterloo.aspx |archivedate=April 6, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=February 2017}}&lt;!-- self promotion from himself --&gt;

=== IBM partnership ===
[[IBM]] approached Microsoft in July 1980 in reference to an operating system for its upcoming personal computer, the [[IBM PC]].{{r |bunnell1982febmar}}  IBM first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter.  When IBM's representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system, Gates referred them to [[Digital Research]] (DRI), makers of the widely used [[CP/M]] operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/1223/258_print.html|title=Pioneers Die Broke|work=Forbes|first1=John Steele|last1=Gordon|first2=Michael|last2=Maiello|authorlink1=John Steele Gordon|date=December 23, 2002|accessdate=March 31, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029221703/http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/1223/258_print.html|archivedate=October 29, 2006|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system. A few weeks later, Gates proposed using [[86-DOS]] (QDOS), an operating system similar to CP/M that [[Tim Paterson]] of [[Seattle Computer Products]] (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC. Microsoft made a deal with SCP to become the exclusive licensing agent, and later the full owner, of 86-DOS. After adapting the operating system for the PC, Microsoft delivered it to IBM as [[PC DOS]] in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000.{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 54}}

Gates did not offer to transfer the [[copyright]] on the operating system, because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone IBM's system.{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 54}} They did, and the sales of [[MS-DOS]] made Microsoft a major player in the industry.{{Sfn |Manes|1994|p=193}}  Despite IBM's name on the operating system, the press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the new computer. ''PC Magazine'' asked if Gates were "the man behind the machine?",&lt;ref name="bunnell1982febmar"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=w_OhaFDePS4C&amp;lpg=RA2-PA18&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = The Man Behind The Machine? | type = interview | work = PC Magazine | date = FebMar 1982 | accessdate = February 17, 2012 | last = Bunnell | first = David | page = 16 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130509162040/http://books.google.com/books?id=w_OhaFDePS4C&amp;lpg=RA2-PA18&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | archivedate = May 9, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[InfoWorld]]'' quoted an expert as stating "it's Gates' computer".&lt;ref name="freiberger19820823"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VDAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title=Bill Gates, Microsoft and the IBM Personal Computer | work=InfoWorld | date=August 23, 1982 | accessdate=January 29, 2015 | author=Freiberger, Paul | page=22 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318020802/https://books.google.com/books?id=VDAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | archivedate=March 18, 2015 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates the president of Microsoft and its board chairman.&lt;ref name="keyevents" /&gt;

From Microsoft's founding in 1975 until 2006, Gates had primary responsibility for the company's product strategy. He gained a reputation for being distant from others; as early as 1981 an industry executive complained in public that "Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls."&lt;ref name="freiberger19810831"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rD0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;f=false | title=Bugs in Radio Shack TRS-80 Model III: How Bad Are They? | accessdate=February 28, 2011 | last=Freiberger | first=Paul | date=August 31, 1981 | publisher=InfoWorld | page=49 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902132455/https://books.google.com/books?id=rD0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;f=false | archivedate=September 2, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another executive recalled that he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times. When they met again a month later, Gates "won or tied every game. He had studied the game until he solved it. That is a competitor."&lt;ref name="Atari Thorlin Interview 2000"&gt;{{cite interview |title= Fred Thorlin: The Big Boss at Atari Program Exchange |url= http://www.atariarchives.org/APX/thorlininterview.php |publisher= Atari archives |date= April 2000 |last= Thorlin |first= Fred |interviewer= Kevin Savetz |accessdate= December 6, 2012 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130101040619/http://www.atariarchives.org/APX/thorlininterview.php |archivedate= January 1, 2013 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates was an executive who met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers. In firsthand accounts of these meetings, the managers described him being verbally combative. He also berated managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk.&lt;ref name="rensin"&gt;{{cite journal | first=David|last= Rensin|title= The Bill Gates Interview|year= 1994|journal= Playboy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/steve/churchillclub.mspx |title=Steve Ballmer Speech Transcript&amp;nbsp; Church Hill Club |first=Steve |last=Ballmer |date=October 9, 1997 |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=March 31, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420152806/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/steve/churchillclub.mspx |archivedate=April 20, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He interrupted presentations with such comments as "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!"&lt;ref name="time GOS"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/gates/gates5.html | first=Walter | last= Isaacson | title = The Gates Operating System |work=Time | date= January 13, 1997 | accessdate= March 31, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20000619090559/http://www.time.com/time/gates/gates5.html|archivedate = June 19, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Why don't you just give up your [[Employee stock option|options]] and join the [[Peace Corps]]?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.breakingwindows.net/1link3.htm | title =Breaking Windows | work =The Wall Street Journal | last =Bank | first =David | date =February 1, 1999 | accessdate =March 31, 2008 | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160416032811/http://www.breakingwindows.net/1link3.htm | archivedate =April 16, 2016 | deadurl =yes | df =mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until, hopefully, Gates was fully convinced.&lt;ref name="time GOS" /&gt; When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, "I'll do it over the weekend."&lt;ref name="chapman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5i8aV1bK5vmwLaw9wYr9nY5bFc4YA |first=Glenn |last=Chapman |title=Bill Gates Signs Off |date=June 27, 2008 |agency=Agence France-Presse |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630070506/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5i8aV1bK5vmwLaw9wYr9nY5bFc4YA |archivedate=June 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pdc97"&gt;{{cite speech|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/1997/pdc.aspx |first=Bill |last=Gates |title=Remarks by Bill Gates |location=San Diego |date=September 26, 1997 |accessdate=March 31, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420152409/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/1997/pdc.aspx |archivedate=April 20, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="herbold"&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|year=2004|last=Herbold|title=The Fiefdom Syndrome: The Turf Battles That Undermine Careers and Companies&amp;nbsp; And How to Overcome Them|isbn=0-385-51067-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Microsoft's early history, Gates was an active software developer, particularly in the company's [[programming language]] products, but his basic role in most of the company's history was primarily as a manager and executive. Gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the [[TRS-80 Model 100]],&lt;ref name="allison1993"&gt;{{cite interview | last=Gates | first=Bill | subjectlink=Bill Gates | interviewer=David Allison | url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/comphist/gates.htm | title=Bill Gates Interview | work=Transcript of a Video History Interview / Computer History Collection | publisher=National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution | accessdate=April 10, 2013 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402195548/http://americanhistory.si.edu/comphist/gates.htm | archivedate=April 2, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but as late as 1989 he wrote code that shipped with the company's products.&lt;ref name="pdc97" /&gt; He remained interested in technical details; in 1985, [[Jerry Pournelle]] wrote that when he watched Gates announce [[Microsoft Excel]], "Something else impressed me. Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat [[hack (programmer subculture)|hack]]."&lt;ref name="pournelle198509"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1985-09/1985_09_BYTE_10-09_Homebrewing#page/n329/mode/2up | title=PCs, Peripherals, Programs, and People | work=BYTE | date=September 1985 | accessdate=March 20, 2016 | author=Pournelle, Jerry | page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On June 15, 2006, Gates announced that over the next two years he would transition out of his day-to-day role to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed [[Ray Ozzie]] in charge of day-to-day management and [[Craig Mundie]] in charge of long-term product strategy.&lt;ref name="mscorpnews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/jun06/06-15CorpNewsPR.mspx |title=Microsoft Announces Plans for July 2008 Transition for Bill Gates |publisher=Microsoft |date=June 15, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619230935/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/jun06/06-15CorpNewsPR.mspx |archivedate=June 19, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many decisions that led to [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] litigation over Microsoft's business practices have had Gates' approval. In the 1998 ''[[United States v. Microsoft]]'' case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner [[David Boies]] over the contextual meaning of words such as, "compete", "concerned", and "we".  The judge and other observers in the court room were seen laughing at various points during the deposition.&lt;ref name="GatesDepositionJudgeLaugh"&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=April 10, 2013 |url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9811/17/judgelaugh.ms.idg/index.html |title=Gates deposition makes judge laugh in court |first=Elizabeth |last=Wasserman |publisher=CNN |date=November 17, 1998 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407052251/http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9811/17/judgelaugh.ms.idg/index.html |archivedate=April 7, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''BusinessWeek'' reported:
{{quotation |Early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying 'I don't recall,' so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle.

Gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. As to his demeanor during the deposition, he said, "Did I fence with Boies? ... I plead guilty.

The first commercial, co-starring [[Jerry Seinfeld]], is a 90-second talk between strangers as Seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store (Shoe Circus) in a mall and notices Gates buying shoes inside.  The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes, he holds up his discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own [[mugshot]] of his arrest in [[New Mexico]] in 1977, for a traffic violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/gatesmug1.html |title=Mugshots |publisher=The Smoking Gun |accessdate=June 9, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724142703/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/gatesmug1.html |archivedate=July 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As they are walking out of the mall, Seinfeld asks Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a "Yes", he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a "Yes". Some say that this is an homage to Seinfeld's own show about "nothing" (''[[Seinfeld]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://grnlight.net/index.php/everything-else-misc/110-microsoft-s-small-screen-of-bore | title = Adblog | publisher = MSNBC | accessdate = May 23, 2014 | date = September 8, 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140525233115/http://grnlight.net/index.php/everything-else-misc/110-microsoft-s-small-screen-of-bore | archivedate = May 25, 2014 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a second commercial in the series, Gates and Seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/seinfeld-and-gates-hit-the-road-for-vista/|title=Seinfeld and Gates Hit the Road for Vista|author=Ina Fried|publisher=''[[CNET]]''|date=September 11, 2008|accessdate=July 26, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231203711/http://www.cnet.com/news/seinfeld-and-gates-hit-the-road-for-vista/|archivedate=December 31, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects.

According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Gates was the world's highest-earning billionaire in 2013, as his net worth increased by US$15.8&amp;nbsp;billion to US$78.5&amp;nbsp;billion. As of January 2014, most of Gates' assets are held in Cascade Investment LLC, an entity through which he owns stakes in numerous businesses, including Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, and Corbis Corp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Billionaires Worth $3.7 Trillion Surge as Gates Wins 2013|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-02/billionaires-worth-3-7-trillion-surge-as-gates-wins-2013.html|accessdate=January 3, 2014|newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=January 2, 2014|author=Matthew G.

Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues in a substantial interview that was published in the March 27, 2014 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. In the interview,  Gates provided his perspective on  climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: "... there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism." Gates also identified innovation as the "real driver of progress" and pronounced that "America's way better today than it's ever been."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Gates: The Rolling Stone Interview|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/bill-gates-the-rolling-stone-interview-20140313?print=true|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann S.

Gates has recently expressed concern about the existential threats of [[superintelligence]]; in a [[Reddit]] "ask me anything", he stated that
&lt;blockquote&gt;First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with [[Elon Musk]] and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2015/01/28/bill-gates-also-worries-artificial-intelligence-is-a-threat/|date=January 28, 2015|title=Bill Gates Says You Should Worry About Artificial Intelligence|first=Eric|last=Mack|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=February 19, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219122941/http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2015/01/28/bill-gates-also-worries-artificial-intelligence-is-a-threat/|archivedate=February 19, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/28/Bill-Gates-Worried-About-Rise-Machines|title=Bill Gates Is Worried About the Rise of the Machines|publisher=The Fiscal Times|accessdate=February 19, 2015|first=Andrew|last=Lumby|date=January 28, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219122609/http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/28/Bill-Gates-Worried-About-Rise-Machines|archivedate=February 19, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/03/24/apple-co-founder-on-artificial-intelligence-the-future-is-scary-and-very-bad-for-people/|title=Apple co-founder on artificial intelligence: 'The future is scary and very bad for people'|publisher=The Washington Post|first=Peter|last=Holley|date=March 24, 2015|accessdate=April 8, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417053459/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/03/24/apple-co-founder-on-artificial-intelligence-the-future-is-scary-and-very-bad-for-people/|archivedate=April 17, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Permalink to an answer from "Hi Reddit, I'm Bill Gates and I'm back for my third AMA.

In 2009, Gates and [[Warren Buffett]] founded [[The Giving Pledge]], whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.&lt;ref name="Fortune challenge"/&gt;

=== Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ===
{{Main article|Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation}}

Gates studied the work of [[Andrew Carnegie]] and [[John D. Rockefeller]], and donated some of his Microsoft stock in 1994 to create the "William H. Gates Foundation." In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations and Gates donated stock valued at $5 billion to create the charitable [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/|title=Gates foundation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523010101/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/|archivedate=May 23, 2012|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundsforngos.org/all-listings/worlds-top-ten-wealthiest-charitable-foundations/|title=The Top Ten US Charitable Foundations|author=Robin Toal|date=September 16, 2013|work=Funds For NGOs|publisher=Funds For NGOs, LLC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407081521/http://www.fundsforngos.org/all-listings/worlds-top-ten-wealthiest-charitable-foundations/|archivedate=April 7, 2014|deadurl=no|accessdate=April 6, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the [[Wellcome Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3913581.stm|title=Bill Gates: billionaire philanthropist|author=Cronin, Jon|date=January 25, 2005|accessdate=April 1, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015134954/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3913581.stm|archivedate=October 15, 2007|deadurl=no|publisher=BBC News|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/AboutUs/OurWork/OurApproach/|title=Our Approach to Giving|publisher=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404212231/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/AboutUs/OurWork/OurApproach/|archivedate=April 4, 2008|deadurl=yes|accessdate=April 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of [[David Rockefeller]] as a major influence.

Melinda Gates suggested that people should emulate the philanthropic efforts of the Salwen family, which had sold its home and given away half of its value, as detailed in ''[[The Power of Half]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/life-style/general/they-half-it-in-them-1.686505|title=They half it in them|author=Bina Abraham|date=October 1, 2010|newspaper=Gulf News|accessdate=March 17, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121122929/http://gulfnews.com/life-style/general/they-half-it-in-them-1.686505|archivedate=January 21, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gates and his wife invited Joan Salwen to Seattle to speak about what the family had done, and on December 9, 2010, Bill and Melinda Gates, and investor [[Warren Buffett]] signed a commitment they called the "[[Giving Pledge]]."

Gates has also provided personal donations to educational institutions. In 1999, Gates donated $20&amp;nbsp;million to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) for the construction of a computer laboratory named the "William H. Gates Building" that was designed by architect [[Frank Gehry]]. While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1999/4/14/bill-gates-donates-20-million-to/|title=Bill Gates Donates $20&amp;nbsp;million to MIT|author=Matthew G.H.

The Maxwell Dworkin Laboratory of the [[Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences]] is named after the mothers of both Gates and Microsoft President Steven A. Ballmer, both of whom were students (Ballmer was a member of the School's graduating class of 1977, while Gates left his studies for Microsoft), and donated funds for the laboratory's construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seas.harvard.edu/about-seas/map-directions/buildings|title=Our Campus TEACHING, RESEARCH, AND ADMINISTRATIVE SPACES|year=2014|work=Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407083133/http://www.seas.harvard.edu/about-seas/map-directions/buildings|archivedate=April 7, 2014|deadurl=no|accessdate=April 6, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gates also donated $6&amp;nbsp;million to the construction of the Gates Computer Science Building, completed in January 1996, on the campus of [[Stanford University]].

On August 15, 2014, Bill Gates posted a video of himself on Facebook in which he is seen [[Ice Bucket Challenge|dumping a bucket of ice water on his head]]. Gates posted the video after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg challenged him to do so in order to raise awareness for the disease ALS ([[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10152332454511961&amp;set=vb.216311481960&amp;type=2&amp;theater|title=Bill Gates|publisher=Facebook|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501122943/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10152332454511961&amp;set=vb.216311481960&amp;type=2&amp;theater|archivedate=May 1, 2015|deadurl=no|accessdate=August 15, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bill og Melinda Gates 2009-06-03 (bilde 01).JPG|thumb|right|Gates and his wife [[Melinda Gates|Melinda]], June 2009]]
Gates married [[Melinda Gates|Melinda French]] on a golf course on the [[Hawaii|Hawaiian]] island of [[Lanai]] on January 1, 1994; he was 38 and she was 29. They have three children: Jennifer Katharine (b. 1996), Rory John (b. 1999), and Phoebe Adele (b. 2002). Gates' oldest daughter Jennifer is an equestrian rider who competed this year in the Longines Global Champions Tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://people.com/sports/jennifer-gates-longines-global-champions-tour-miami-2018/|title=Bill Gates' Daughter Jennifer Aims High in Miami Beach Horse-Jumping Competition|work=PEOPLE.com|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family resides in a [[Bill Gates' house|modern design mansion]], which is an [[earth sheltering|earth-sheltered house]] in the side of a hill overlooking [[Lake Washington]] in Medina near [[Seattle]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]], [[United States]]. According to 2007 [[King County, Washington|King County]] public records, the total assessed value of the property (land and house) is $125&amp;nbsp;million, and the annual property taxes are $991,000.

In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Gates stated in regard to his faith:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.&lt;ref name="God" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same interview, Gates said: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I agree with people like [[Richard Dawkins]] that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm&amp;nbsp; not all&amp;nbsp; that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs]. I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know.&lt;ref name="God"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/bill-gates-the-rolling-stone-interview-20140313?page=5|title=Bill Gates: The Rolling Stone Interview|last=Goodell|first=Jeff|date=March 27, 2014|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=April 14, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509035553/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/bill-gates-the-rolling-stone-interview-20140313?page=5|archivedate=May 9, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His choice of things to take on a desert island were, for music: "[[Blue Skies (Irving Berlin song)|Blue Skies]]" by [[Willie Nelson]]; book: ''[[The Better Angels of Our Nature]]'' by [[Steven Pinker]]; and luxury item: a DVD Collection of Lectures from [[The Teaching Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06z1zdt|title=BBC Radio 4&amp;nbsp; Desert Island Discs, Bill Gates|date=|work=BBC|accessdate=March 29, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320092444/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06z1zdt|archivedate=March 20, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
