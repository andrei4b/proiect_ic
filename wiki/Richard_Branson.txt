'''Sir Richard Charles Nicholas Branson''' (born 18 July 1950) is an English [[business magnate]], investor and [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]].&lt;ref&gt;List of companies related to Richard Branson - http://www.flixens.com/director/richard-charles-nicholas-branson&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the [[Virgin Group]], which controls more than 400 companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-home/article-23897620-londons-1000-most-influential-people-2010-tycoons-and-retailers.do |title=London's 1000 most influential people 2010: Tycoons &amp; Retailers |work=Evening Standard |location=London |date=26 November 2010 |accessdate=11 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303202728/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-home/article-23897620-londons-1000-most-influential-people-2010-tycoons-and-retailers.do |archivedate= 3 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Branson expressed his desire to become an entrepreneur at a young age. His first business venture, at the age of 16, was a magazine called ''Student''. In 1970, he set up a mail-order record business. He opened a chain of record stores, Virgin Recordslater known as [[Virgin Megastores]]in 1972. Branson's Virgin brand grew rapidly during the 1980s, as he set up [[Virgin Atlantic]] airline and expanded the [[Virgin Records]] music label.

In March 2000, Branson was [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|knighted]] at Buckingham Palace for "services to entrepreneurship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Virgin tycoon is knighted|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/695511.stm|agency=BBC|date=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his work in retail, music and transport (with interests in land, air, sea and space travel), his taste for adventure, and for his humanitarian work, he became a prominent figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barling|first1=Julian|title=The SAGE Handbook of Organizational Behavior: Volume Two: Macro Approaches|publisher=SAGE|page=383}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thirty of the very best of British|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10050832/Thirty-of-the-very-best-of-British.html|agency=The Telegraph|date=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, he was named in the BBC's poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2208671.stm "100 great British heroes"]. BBC News. Retrieved 21 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he founded spaceflight corporation [[Virgin Galactic]], based at [[Mojave Air and Space Port]], noted for the [[SpaceShipOne]] and [[SpaceShip Two]] projects.  

In November 2017, ''[[Forbes]]'' listed Branson's estimated net worth at [[United States dollar|US$]]5.1 billion.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/richard-branson |title=Richard Branson |work=Forbes |accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Branson was born in [[Blackheath, London]], the eldest of three children of [[Eve Branson]] (''ne'' Evette Huntley Flindt; born 1924), a former ballet dancer and air hostess, and Edward James Branson (19182011), a [[barrister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/law-obituaries/8501350/Edward-Branson.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Edward Branson | date=8 May 2011}}&lt;br&gt;- "Births", ''[[The Times]]'', 12 July 1950, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fdnr1"&gt;[https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/finding-my-roots] ''[[Finding Your Roots]]'', 2 February 2016, PBS&lt;/ref&gt; He has two younger sisters.&lt;ref name=SagaMar13&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.saga.co.uk/saga-magazine/2013/march/eve-branson.aspx|title=Like mother, like son|author=Nina Myskow|date=13 March 2013|publisher=Saga magazine|accessdate=5 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105104205/https://www.saga.co.uk/saga-magazine/2013/march/eve-branson.aspx|archivedate=5 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather, the [[Right Honourable]] [[G. A. H. Branson|Sir George Arthur Harwin Branson]], was a judge of the [[High Court of Justice]] and a [[Privy Councillor]].&lt;ref&gt;"Forthcoming Marriages", ''[[The Times]]'', 22 June 1949, pg.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Branson was educated at [[Scaitcliffe School]], a [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|prep school]] in Surrey, before briefly attending Cliff View House School in [[Sussex]].&lt;ref name=TimesSep98&gt;Richard Branson. "At school I was dyslexic and a dunce.", ''The Times'', London, 11 September 1998, pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt; 

His third great-grandfather, John Edward Branson, left England for [[India]] in 1793; John Edward's father, Harry Wilkins Branson, later joined him in [[Madras]]. On the show ''[[Finding Your Roots]]'', Branson was shown to have 3.9% South Asian (Indian) DNA, likely through intermarriage.&lt;ref name=fdnr1/&gt; He attended [[Stowe School]], an [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent school]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] until the age of sixteen.&lt;ref name=TimesSep98/&gt; 

Branson has [[dyslexia]] and had poor academic performance; on his last day at school, his headmaster, [[Robert Drayson]], told him he would either end up in prison or become a millionaire.&lt;ref name=TimesSep98/&gt; Branson's parents were supportive of his endeavours from an early age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shavinina|first=Larisa V|title=Micro-social factors in the development of entrepreneurial giftedness: the case of Richard Branson|journal=High Ability Studies|date=December 2006|volume=17|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was an entrepreneur; one of her most successful ventures was building and selling wooden tissue boxes and wastepaper bins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Virgin Way: Everything I know about leadership|last=Branson|first=Richard|publisher=Portfolio/Penguin|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Record business===
Branson started his record business from the church where he ran ''Student'' magazine. He interviewed several prominent personalities of the late 1960s for the magazine including [[Mick Jagger]] and [[R. D. Laing]].&lt;ref name="Branson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Branson|title=Losing My Virginity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NWxnDythozIC|date=4 August 2011|publisher=Ebury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4464-8334-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Branson advertised popular records in ''Student'', and it was an overnight success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.businessinsider.com/richard-branson-fails-virgin-companies-that-went-bust-2012-4?op=1 |title=RICHARD BRANSON'S FAILS: 14 Virgin Companies That Went Bust |author=Mallory Russell |publisher=[[Business Insider]] |date = 21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trading under the name "Virgin", he sold records for considerably less than the "High Street" outlets, especially the chain [[W. H. Smith]]. Branson once said, "There is no point in starting your own business unless you do it out of a sense of frustration." The name "Virgin" was suggested by one of Branson's early employees because they were all new at business.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Richard Branson  ''Losing my Virginity''&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, many products were sold under restrictive marketing agreements that limited discounting, despite efforts in the 1950s and 1960s to limit so-called [[resale price maintenance]].&lt;ref&gt;Another example was the [[Net Book Agreement]], which limited the ability of book outlets, including discount book clubs, to offer deep discounts.&lt;/ref&gt;

Branson eventually started a record shop in [[Oxford Street]] in [[London]]. In 1971, he was questioned in connection with the selling of records in Virgin stores that had been declared export stock. The matter was never brought before a court because Branson agreed to repay any unpaid VAT of 33% and a 70,000 fine. His parents re-mortgaged the family home in order to help pay the settlement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[File:The Manor Studios.jpg|thumb|[[The Manor Studio]], Richard Branson's [[recording studio]] in the [[manor house]] at the village of [[Shipton-on-Cherwell]] in [[Oxfordshire]].]]
Earning enough money from his record store, Branson in 1972 launched the record label [[Virgin Records]] with [[Nik Powell]], and bought a country estate north of [[Oxford]] in which he installed a residential [[recording studio]], [[The Manor Studio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.biography.com/people/richard-branson-9224520|title=Richard Branson Biography|publisher=[[A&amp;E Television Networks]] |website=The Biography.com website|accessdate =16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He leased studio time to fledgling artists, including multi-instrumentalist [[Mike Oldfield]], whose debut album ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' (1973) was the first release for Virgin Records and became a chart-topping best-seller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03cw8g0 |title=Tubular Bells: The Mike Oldfield Story |publisher=BBC |accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virgin signed such controversial bands as the [[Sex Pistols]], which other companies were reluctant to sign. Virgin Records would go on to sign other artists including the [[Rolling Stones]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[UB40]], [[Steve Winwood]] and [[Paula Abdul]], and to become the world's largest independent record label.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/197616|title=Richard Branson  The P.T. Barnum of British Business|last=|first=|date=2008|website=|publisher=|access-date=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also won praise for exposing the public to such obscure avant-garde music as [[Faust (band)|Faust]] and [[Can (band)|Can]]. Virgin Records also introduced [[Culture Club]] to the music world. In 1982, Virgin purchased the gay nightclub [[Heaven (nightclub)|Heaven]]. In 1991, in a consortium with [[David Frost]], Branson made an unsuccessful bid for three [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] franchisees under the [[CPV-TV]] name. The early 1980s also saw his only attempt as a produceron the novelty record "[[Baa, Baa, Black Sheep]]", by Singing Sheep in association with Doug McLean and Grace McDonald. The recording was a series of sheep baa-ing along to a drum-machine-produced track and reached number 42 in the UK charts in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epnofny.com/epnmag/blog/2012/12/02/entrepreneur-guru-sir-richard-branson/ |title=Entrepreneur Guru Sir Richard Branson |publisher=EPN |date=2 December 2012 |accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, to keep his airline company afloat, Branson sold the Virgin label to [[EMI]] for 500&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="bbcprofile"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3693588.stm|title=Profile: Richard Branson|publisher=The BBC|date=27 September 2004|accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Branson said that he wept when the sale was completed because the record business had been the very start of the Virgin empire. He created [[V2 Records]] in 1996 in order to re-enter the music business, owning 5% himself.&lt;ref name="solarnav"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarnavigator.net/sponsorship/richard_branson.htm|title=Richard Branson and Virgin-Probably Britains best known Entrepreneur|publisher=Solar Navigator.net|accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business ventures===
{{Main article|Timeline of Richard Branson's business ventures}}
Branson formed [[Virgin Atlantic Airways]] in 1984, launched [[Virgin Mobile]] in 1999, and [[Virgin Blue]] in Australia (now named [[Virgin Australia]]) in 2000. He was ninth in [[Sunday Times Rich List|''The Sunday Times'' Rich List 2006]] of the wealthiest people or families in the UK, worth slightly more than 3&amp;nbsp;billion. Branson wrote in his autobiography of the decision to start an airline:

{{quote|"My interest in life comes from setting myself huge, apparently unachievable challenges and trying to rise above them ... from the perspective of wanting to live life to the full, I felt that I had to attempt it."}}

Branson's first successful entry into the airline industry was during a trip to Puerto Rico. His flight was cancelled, so he decided to charter his own plane the rest of the way and offer a ride to the rest of the stranded passengers for a small fee in order to cover the cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/richard-branson-entrepreneur-visionary-2011-5/|title=Richard Branson: How a Cancelled Flight Led To The World's Greatest Travel Empire|last=Zeveloff|first=J|date=May 2011|website=|publisher=|access-date=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Branson took what many saw as being one of his riskier business exploits by entering into the railway business. [[Virgin Trains]] won the franchises for the former [[Inter-city rail|Intercity]] [[West Coast Main Line|West Coast]] and Cross-Country sectors of [[British Rail]].

Virgin acquired European [[short-haul]] airline Euro Belgian Airlines in 1996 and renamed it [[Virgin Express]]. In 2006, the airline was merged with [[SN Brussels Airlines]] forming [[Brussels Airlines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/virgin-express-creates-brussels-airline-566542.html|title=Virgin Express creates Brussels airline|date=2004-03-17|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also started a national airline based in Nigeria, called [[Virgin Nigeria]], which ceased operations in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8089858.stm|title=Virgin to sell Nigerian airline|date=2009-06-08|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another airline, [[Virgin America]], began flying out of [[San Francisco International Airport]] in August 2007.

A series of disputes in the early 1990s caused tension between Virgin Atlantic and [[British Airways]], which viewed Virgin as an emerging competitor. Virgin subsequently accused British Airways of poaching its passengers, [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]] its computers, and leaking stories to the press that portrayed Virgin negatively. After the so-called campaign of "dirty tricks", British Airways settled the case, giving 500,000 to Branson, a further 110,000 to his airline, and had to pay legal fees of up to 3&amp;nbsp;million. Branson distributed his compensation (the so-called "BA bonus") among his staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/02/theairlineindustry.britishairways |title= Row over dirty tricks led to decade of hostilities|author=Lee Glendinning  |date=2 August 2007 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=31 August 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 2004, Branson announced the signing of a deal under which a new [[space tourism]] company, [[Virgin Galactic]], will license the technology behind [[Spaceship One]]funded by [[Microsoft]] co-founder [[Paul Allen]] and designed by legendary American aeronautical engineer and visionary [[Burt Rutan]]to take paying passengers into [[suborbital]] [[Outer space|space]]. Virgin Galactic (wholly owned by Virgin Group) plans to make flights available to the public with tickets priced at US$200,000 using [[Scaled Composites White Knight Two]].&lt;ref name=sn20131111&gt;

Branson's next venture with the Virgin group was [[Virgin Fuels]], which was set up to respond to [[global warming]] and exploit the recent spike in fuel costs by offering a revolutionary, cheaper fuel for automobiles and, in the near future, aircraft. Branson has stated that he was formerly a [[Climate change denial|global warming sceptic]] and was influenced in his decision by a breakfast meeting with [[Al Gore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=2477400 |title=ABC News: Breakfast With Al Gore Persuades Branson to Pledge Billions to Global Warming |publisher=ABC News |date=22 September 2006 |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 September 2006, Branson pledged to invest the profits of Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Trains in research for environmentally-friendly fuels. The investment is estimated to be worth $3&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/index.php?menuID=1&amp;subID=770 | title=Come fly with me, come give it away | accessdate=23 September 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65U04AmZI?url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/index.php?menuID=1&amp;subID=770 | archivedate=16 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 July 2006, Branson sold his [[Virgin Mobile]] company to UK cable TV, broadband, and telephone company NTL/[[NTL:Telewest]] for almost 1&amp;nbsp;billion. A new company was launched with much fanfare and publicity on 8 February 2007, under the name [[Virgin Media]]. The decision to merge his Virgin Media Company with NTL was to integrate both of the companies' compatible parts of commerce.

In June 2006, a tip-off from Virgin Atlantic led both UK and US competition authorities to investigate price-fixing attempts between Virgin Atlantic and British Airways. In August 2007, British Airways was fined 271&amp;nbsp;million over the allegations. Virgin Atlantic was given immunity for tipping off the authorities and received no finea controversial decision the Office of Fair Trading defended as being in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ruth Sunderland |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/airlines/story/0,,2141647,00.html |title=OFT defends 'snitch' policy ||date=5 August 2007|accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 February 2007, Branson announced the setting up of a new global science and technology prizeThe [[Virgin Earth Challenge]]in the belief that history has shown that prizes of this nature encourage technological advancements for the good of mankind. The Virgin Earth Challenge was to award $25&amp;nbsp;million to the individual or group who are able to demonstrate a commercially viable design that will result in the net removal of anthropogenic, atmospheric greenhouse gases each year for at least ten years without countervailing harmful effects. This removal must have long-term effects and contribute materially to the stability of the Earth's climate. Branson also announced that he would be joined in the adjudication of the prize by a panel of five judges, all world authorities in their respective fields: [[Al Gore]], [[Sir Crispin Tickell]], [[Tim Flannery]], [[James E. Hansen]], and [[James Lovelock]].

In February 2009, Branson's Virgin organisation was reported as bidding to buy the former [[Honda in Formula One|Honda Formula One]] team. Branson later stated an interest in [[Formula One]], but claimed that, before the Virgin brand became involved with Honda or any other team, Formula One would have to develop a more economically efficient and environmentally responsible image. At the start of the 2009 Formula One season on 28 March, it was announced that Virgin would be sponsoring the new [[Brawn GP]] team,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crash.net/f1/News/144459/1/bransons_virgin_group_to_sponsor_brawn_gp.html Branson's Virgin Group to sponsor Brawn GP], www.crash.net&lt;/ref&gt; with discussions also under way about introducing a less "dirty" fuel in the medium term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/146360-virgin-become-brawn-gps-title-sponsor Virgin Become Brawn Gp's Title Sponsor], Bleacher Report&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the season and the subsequent purchase of Brawn GP by Mercedes Benz, Branson invested in an 80% buyout of Manor Grand Prix,&lt;ref name="F1News"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://formula-1.updatesport.com/news/article/1244801351/formula_one/F1headlines/FIA-release-2010-entry-list/view.html |title=UpdateF1 &gt;&gt; Formula 1 News &gt; FIA release 2010 entry list |publisher=Formula-1.updatesport.com |date=12 June 2009 |accessdate=1 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728053711/http://formula-1.updatesport.com/news/article/1244801351/formula_one/F1headlines/FIA-release-2010-entry-list/view.html |archivedate=28 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/76653 |title=Virgin set for Manor GP move |work=Autosport |accessdate=14 September 2010 |date=3 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the team being renamed [[Virgin Racing]].

Branson and [[Tony Fernandes]], owner of [[Air Asia]] and [[Lotus F1 Racing]], had a bet for the [[2010 F1 season]] where the team's boss should work on the winner's airline during a charity flight dressed as a stewardess. Fernandes escaped as the winner of the bet, as Lotus Racing ended tenth in the championship, while Virgin Racing ended twelfth and last.

In August 2012, the franchise for the West Coast Main Line, managed by Virgin Rail since 1997, came to an end. The contract was awarded to FirstGroup after a competitive tender process overseen by the Department for Transport. Branson had expressed his concerns about the tender process and questioned the validity of the business plan submitted by FirstGroup. When Virgin Rail lost the contract, Branson said he was convinced the civil servants had "got their maths wrong". In October, after an investigation into the bidding process, the deal was scrapped. The Transport Secretary [[Patrick McLoughlin]] announced there were "significant technical flaws" in the process and mistakes had been made by transport staff. Virgin Rail continues to operate the West Coast line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19809717|title=West Coast Main Line deal scrapped after contract flaws discovered|publisher=BBC News|date=3 October 2012|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Branson made several world record-breaking attempts after 1985, when in the spirit of the [[Blue Riband]] he attempted the fastest Atlantic Ocean crossing. His first attempt in the "Virgin Atlantic Challenger" led to the boat capsizing in British waters and a rescue by RAF helicopter, which received wide media coverage. Some newspapers called for Branson to reimburse the government for the rescue cost. In 1986, in his "Virgin Atlantic Challenger II", with sailing expert Daniel McCarthy, he beat the record by two hours.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;McKenzie, Sheena (25 April 2013) "[http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/25/business/richard-branson-virgin-atlantic-challenger-ii/ Back to the future for Richard Branson's retro 80s speedboat]".

In January 1991, Branson crossed the Pacific from Japan to Arctic Canada, {{convert|6700|mi|km}}, in a balloon of {{convert|2600000|cuft|m3}}. This broke the record, with a speed of {{convert|245|mph|km/h}}.

Between 1995 and 1998, Branson, [[Per Lindstrand]], [[Vladimir Dzhanibekov]], [[Larry Newman (aviator)|Larry Newman]], and [[Steve Fossett]] made attempts to circumnavigate the globe by balloon. In late 1998 they made a record-breaking flight from Morocco to Hawaii but were unable to complete a global flight before [[Bertrand Piccard]] and [[Brian Jones (aeronaut)|Brian Jones]] in ''[[Breitling Orbiter 3]]'' in March 1999.

In March 2004, Branson set a record by travelling from [[Dover]] to [[Calais]] in a [[Gibbs Aquada]] in 1 hour, 40 minutes and 6 seconds, the fastest crossing of the [[English Channel]] in an [[amphibious vehicle]]. The previous record of six hours was set by two Frenchmen.&lt;ref name="Rick"&gt;{{Cite news| last = BBC News| title = Branson sets cross-Channel record|publisher=BBC News  | date = 14 June 2004 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/coventry_warwickshire/3805275.stm | accessdate =13 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The cast of ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', [[Jeremy Clarkson]], [[James May]] and [[Richard Hammond]], attempted to break this record in an amphibious vehicle which they had constructed and, while successfully crossing the channel, did not break Branson's record. After being intercepted by the Coast Guard and asked what their intentions were, Clarkson remarked "..our intentions are to go across the Channel faster than 'Beardy' Branson!".

==Controversies==
===Tax evasion===
In 1971, Branson was convicted and briefly jailed for tax evasion, having fraudulently obtained export documents for records to be sold on the domestic market in order to avoid paying [[Value Added Tax]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/business/how_failure_breeds_success/2014/05/richard_branson_tax_fraud_how_a_youthful_indiscretion_helped_create_a_billionaire.html|title=A Portrait of the Billionaire as a Young Tax Cheat|first=Jordan|last=Weissmann|date=27 May 2014|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2018|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardianlv.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guardianlv.com/2014/05/richard-branson-from-tax-fraud-to-billionaire/|title=Richard Branson : From Tax Fraud to Billionaire  Guardian Liberty Voice|date=29 May 2014|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customs officials caught onto the scheme and executed a [[sting operation]], marking records bought for the international market with [[invisible ink]] and subsequently buying them on the domestic market. Branson was advised of the sting by an anonymous tip-off and attempted to dispose of the evidence, but this was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardianlv.com"/&gt;

Branson's business empire is owned by a complicated series of [[offshore trust]]s and companies. ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' stated that his wealth is calculated at 3&amp;nbsp;billion; if he were to retire to his Caribbean island and liquidate all of this, he would pay relatively little in tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2483988_2,00.html |title=The Sunday Times: Britain |accessdate=1 January 2007 |work=The Times |location=London |first=Roland |last=Watson }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} Branson has been criticised for his business strategy, and has been accused of being a [[carpetbagger#United Kingdom|carpetbagger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/21/richard-branson-northern-rock|title=Is Richard Branson all he's cracked up to be?|last=Chakrabortty|first=Aditya|date=21 November 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=7 April 2013}} Branson's reply is here [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/23/nonsense-virgin-success-dependent-on-state].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/24/richard-branson-defence-virgin-trains|title=Don't be fooled by Richard Branson's defence of Virgin trains|author=Aditya Chakrabortty|date=24 June 2013|publisher=[[The Guardian|guardian.co.uk]]|accessdate=27 June 2013}} Branson's response is here [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/20/virgin-trains-handouts-track].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aditya Chakrabortty|date=10 June 2013|title=The truth about Richard Branson's Virgin Rail profits|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/10/truth-richard-branson-virgin-rail-profits|publisher=[[The Guardian|guardian.co.uk]]|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Salmon|date=14 October 2012|title=Branson eyes RBS bargain: After 1.65bn deal collapses, tycoon could bid just 650m for 316 branches|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2217712/Branson-eyes-RBS-bargain-After-1-65bn-deal-collapses-tycoon-bid-just-650m-316-branches.html|publisher=[[The Daily Mail|dailymail.co.uk]]|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Branson responded that he is living on Necker for health rather than tax reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/13/richard-branson-tax-exile-virgin |title=Richard Branson denies being a tax exile |last1=Garside |first1=Juliette |date=13 October 2013 |website=www.theguardian.com |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Branson described himself as a "tax exile", having saved millions in tax by surrendering his British citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/businessclub/10376341/Ive-been-a-tax-exile-for-seven-years-says-Branson.html|title=Ive been a tax exile for seven years, says Branson|first=Roland|last=Gribben|date=13 October 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was echoed by [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]], Labour's [[John McDonnell]], in 2016, amid calls for his knighthood to be revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/704616/sir-richard-branson-jeremy-corbyn-virgin-knighthood-tax-exile-john-mcdonnell|title=Tax exile Richard Branson facing calls for his knighthood to be scrapped|first=Jack|last=Fenwick|date=28 August 2016|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assault allegation===
On 27 November 2017 Richard Branson was accused of sexual assault to a singer Antonia Jenae. A spokesperson to Branson confirmed to ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' that members of [[Joss Stone]] band were invited for a party in 2010, but he vehemently denied the claims stating he had "no recollection" of the events, and that the claims were "patently false".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/11/25/sir-richard-branson-has-no-recollection-alleged-incident-necker/|title=Sir Richard Branson has 'no recollection' of alleged incident at Necker Island}}&lt;/ref&gt;
