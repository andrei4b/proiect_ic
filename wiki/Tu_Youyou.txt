'''Tu Youyou''' ({{zh |c =  |p = T Yuyu}}; born 30 December 1930) is a Chinese [[Medicinal chemistry|pharmaceutical chemist]] and educator. She discovered [[artemisinin]] (also known as ''qinghaosu'') and [[dihydroartemisinin]], used to treat [[malaria]], which has saved millions of lives. Tu Youyou's discovery of artemisinin and its treatment of malaria is a significant breakthrough in 20th century [[tropical medicine]] and an important health improvement for people of tropical developing countries in South Asia, Africa, and South America. 

For her work, Tu received the 2011 [[Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research|Lasker Award]] in clinical medicine and the 2015 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] jointly with [[William C. Campbell (scientist)|William C. Campbell]] and [[Satoshi mura]]. Tu is the first Chinese [[Nobel prize in physiology or medicine|Nobel laureate in physiology or medicine]] and the first female citizen of the [[People's Republic of China]] to receive a Nobel Prize in any category, as well as the first Chinese person to receive the [[Lasker Award]]. Tu Youyou was born and educated and carried out research exclusively in China.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2011.08.024 |title = Artemisinin: Discovery from the Chinese herbal garden |year = 2011 |last1 = Miller |first1 = Louis H. |last2 = Su |first2 = Xinzhuan |journal = Cell |volume = 146 |issue = 6 |pages = 855858 |pmid = 21907397 |pmc = 3414217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Tu Youyou carried on her work in the 1960s and 70s during China's [[Cultural Revolution]], when scientists were denigrated as one of the [[Stinking Old Ninth|nine black categories]] in society according to [[Maoism|Maoist theory]] (or possibly that of the [[Gang of Four]]).

In 1967, during the [[Vietnam War]], [[Ho Chi Minh]], the leader of [[North Vietnam]], which was at war against [[South Vietnam]] and the United States, asked Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] for help in developing a malaria treatment for his soldiers trooping down the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]], where a majority came down with a form of malaria which is resistant to [[chloroquine]]. Because malaria was also a major cause of death in China's southern provinces including [[Hainan]], [[Yunnan]], [[Guangxi]], and [[Guangdong]], Zhou Enlai convinced [[Mao Zedong]] to set up a secret drug discovery project, named [[Project 523]] after its starting date, 23{{nbsp}}May 1967.&lt;ref name="McKenna"&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21228382.000-the-modest-woman-who-beat-malaria-for-china.html The modest woman who beat malaria for China], by Phil McKenna, New Scientist, 15 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Upon joining the project unit, Tu was initially sent to Hainan where she studied patients who had been infected with the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/oct/05/youyou-tu-how-maos-challenge-to-malaria-pioneer-led-to-nobel-prize |title = Tu Youyou: how Maos challenge to malaria pioneer led to Nobel prize |author = Tom Phillips |date = 6 October 2015 |publisher = The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the time she spent there, her husband was [[Down to the Countryside Movement|banished to the countryside]], meaning that her daughter had to be entrusted to a nursery in Beijing.&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt;

Scientists worldwide had screened over 240,000 compounds without success. In 1969, Tu Youyou, then 39 years old, had an idea of screening Chinese herbs. She first investigated the Chinese medical classics in history, visiting practitioners of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] all over the country on her own. She gathered her findings in a notebook called ''A Collection of Single Practical Prescriptions for Anti-Malaria''. Her notebook summarized 640 prescriptions. Her team also screened over 2,000 traditional Chinese recipes and made 380 herbal [[extract]]s, which were tested on mice.&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt;

One compound was effective, sweet wormwood (''[[Artemisia annua]]''), which was used for "intermittent fevers," a hallmark of malaria. As Tu also presented at the project seminar, its preparation was described in a 1,600-year-old text, in a recipe titled, "Emergency Prescriptions Kept Up One's Sleeve". At first, it didn't work, because they extracted it with traditional boiling water. Tu Youyou discovered that a low-temperature extraction process could be used to isolate an effective antimalarial substance from the plant; Tu says she was influenced by a [[Chinese herbology|traditional Chinese herbal medicine]] source, ''The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency Treatments'', written in 340 by [[Ge Hong]], which states that this herb should be steeped in cold water.&lt;ref name="scimag"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://news.sciencemag.org/asia/2011/09/lasker-award-rekindles-debate-over-artemisinins-discovery |title = Lasker Award Rekindles Debate Over Artemisinin's Discovery &amp;#124; Science/AAAS &amp;#124; News |publisher = News.sciencemag.org |accessdate = 7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book contained the useful reference to the herb: "A handful of qinghao immersed with two litres of water, wring out the juice and drink it all."&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; After rereading the recipe, Tu realised the hot water had already damaged the active ingredient in the plant; therefore she proposed a method using low-temperature ether to extract the effective compound instead. The [[Animal testing|animal tests]] showed it was completely effective in mice and monkeys.&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt;

Furthermore, Tu volunteered to be the first human subject. "As head of this research group, I had the responsibility" she said. It was safe, so she conducted successful clinical trials with human patients. Her work was published anonymously in 1977.&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt; In 1981, she presented the findings relating to artemisinin at a meeting with the World Health Organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/10/06/how-a-secret-chinese-military-drug-based-on-an-ancient-herb-won-the-nobel-prize/ |title = How a secret Chinese military drug based on an ancient herb won the Nobel Prize |date = 6 October 2015 |last = Guo |first = Jeff |website = [[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v17/n10/full/nm.2471.html |title = The discovery of artemisinin (qinghaosu) and gifts from Chinese medicine |last = Tu |first = Youyou |date = 11 October 2011 |publisher = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |doi = 10.1038/nm.2471 |volume=17 |journal=Nature Medicine |pages=12171220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Tu Youyou was born in [[Ningbo]], Zhejiang, China on 30 December 1930.&lt;ref name="Tu_ifeng"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://news.ifeng.com/history/1/200703/0316_335_88997_2.shtml |title = Magic Drug Saved Half Billion People |publisher = [[Phoenix Television]] News, Hong Kong |date = 16 March 2007 |accessdate = 13 September 2011 |language = zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[Xiaoshi Middle School]] for junior high school and the first year of high school, before transferring to [[Ningbo Middle School]] in 1948. A tuberculosis infection interrupted her high-school education, but inspired her to go into medical research.&lt;ref name=NobelBio&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2015/tu-bio.html|title=Youyou Tu - Biographical|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1951 to 1955, she attended [[Peking University]] Medical School / Beijing Medical College.{{efn|name="Medical_School"}} Tu studied at the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, and graduated in 1955. Later Tu was trained for two and a half years in [[traditional Chinese medicine]].

After graduation, Tu worked at the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (now the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medical Sciences{{efn|name="CACMS"}}) in Beijing. She was promoted to a Researcher ({{lang|zh-hans|}}, the highest researcher rank in mainland China equivalent to the [[List of academic ranks|academic rank]] of a [[professor (highest academic rank)|full professor]]) in 1980 shortly after the [[Chinese economic reform]] began in 1978. In 2001 she was promoted to academic advisor for doctoral candidates. Currently she is the Chief Scientist in the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Official Biography |url = http://www.icmm.ac.cn/zsyjy/201101/11.html |publisher = China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences |accessdate = 14 September 2011 |language = zh |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110906013716/http://www.icmm.ac.cn/zsyjy/201101/11.html |archivedate = 6 September 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, her office is in an old [[apartment building]] in [[Dongcheng District, Beijing]].&lt;ref name="Tu_ifeng" /&gt;

Before 2011, Tu Youyou had been obscure for decades, and is described as "almost completely forgotten by people".&lt;ref name="Tu_Wen Wei Po"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://paper.wenweipo.com/2011/09/15/YO1109150008.htm |script-title = zh: |location = Hong Kong |publisher = ''[[Wen Wei Po]]'' |accessdate = 13 September 2011 |language = zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tu is regarded as the ''Professor of Three Noes''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://en.people.cn/n/2015/1006/c90000-8958353.html |title = Chinese Scientist Wins Nobel Prize in Medicine; China Hails the Laureate with Reflection |last = Zou |first = Luxiao |date = 6 October 2015 |publisher = [[People's Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  no postgraduate degree (there was no postgraduate education then in China), no study or research experience abroad, and not a member of any Chinese national academies, ''i.e.'' [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] and [[Chinese Academy of Engineering]].&lt;ref name="Tu_Sohu1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://roll.sohu.com/20110913/n319211381.shtml |script-title = zh:  |publisher = [[Sohu]] News |date = 13 September 2011 |accessdate = 13 September 2011 |language = zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until 1979, there were no postgraduate degree programs in China, and China was largely isolated from the rest of the world.  Tu is now regarded as a representative figure of the first generation of Chinese medical workers since the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949.&lt;ref name="Tu_Sohu2"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://health.sohu.com/20090929/n267089753.shtml |script-title = zh:  |publisher = [[Sohu]] News |date = 29 September 2009 |accessdate = 13 September 2011 |language = zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Family ===
Tu Youyou and her husband, Li Tingzhao (), a [[metallurgical engineer]], live in Beijing. Li Tingzhao was Tu's classmate at Xiaoshi Middle School. Their younger daughter lives in Beijing, whilst their older daughter lives with her husband and daughter in the United States, seen in a few pictures (Tu Youyou's son in law and granddaughter). Tu's maternal grandfather, [[Yao Yongbai]] ([[:zh:|]]), was the first Director of [[National Treasury Administration]] after its reform. Her uncle, [[Yao Qingsan]] ([[:zh:|]]), was an eminent economist, banker, and the first [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] in China.

{{Quote|
My [first] name, &lt;u&gt;Youyou&lt;/u&gt;, was given by my father, who adapted it from the sentence &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;ref name="youyou"&gt;("Deer Bleating" in ''Xiao Ya'' of the ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; translated as Deer bleat youyou while they are eating the wild [[Artemisia (genus)|Hao]] in the [[Classic of Poetry|Chinese ''Book of Odes'']].

== Research ==

=== Schistosomiasis ===
During her early years, Tu studied ''[[Lobelia chinensis]]'', a traditional Chinese medicine, for curing [[schistosomiasis]], caused by [[parasitic worms]] which infect the [[urinary tract]] or the [[intestines]], which was widespread in the first half of the 20th century in South China.{{Citation needed |date = September 2011}}

Tu started her [[malaria]] research in China when the Cultural Revolution was in progress. In early 1969, Tu was appointed head of the project, named [[Project 523]] research group at her institute. She collected 2000 candidate recipes, ancient texts, and folk remedies for possible leads for her research. By 1971, her team had made 380 extracts from 200 herbs, and discovered the extracts from ''qinghao'' (''[[Artemisia annua]]'', sweet wormwood) looked particularly promising in dramatically inhibiting ''[[Plasmodium]]'' growth in animals. Tu found a way to extract it and her innovations boosted potency and slashed toxicity of this extract.&lt;ref name="L Award Description"&gt;{{cite web |last = Strauss |first = Evelyn |title = Award Description |url = http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/2011_c_description.htm |work = Lasker~DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award |publisher = [[Lasker Foundation]] |location = New York, NY 10017, USA |date = September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, she and her colleagues obtained the pure substance and named it ''qinghaosu'' ([[:zh:|]]), or [[artemisinin]] as it is commonly called in the west,&lt;ref name="L Award Description" /&gt;&lt;ref name="th Anniversary"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules/special_issues/artemisinin/ |title = Special Issue Artemisinin (Qinghaosu): Commemorative Issue in Honor of Professor Youyou Tu on the Occasion of her 80th Anniversary |publisher = ''[[Molecules (journal)|Molecules]]'' |first = Geoff |last = Brown |year = 2010 |accessdate = 14 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Acceptance remarks by Tu"&gt;{{cite web |last = Tu |first = Youyou |title = Acceptance remarks by Tu Youyou |url = http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/2011_c_accept_youyou.htm |work = Lasker~DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award |publisher = [[Lasker Foundation]] |location = New York, NY 10017, USA |quote = Equipped with a sound knowledge in both traditional Chinese medicine and modern pharmaceutical sciences, my team inherited and developed the essence of traditional Chinese medicine using modern science and technology and eventually, we successfully accomplished the discovery and development of qinghaosu from qinghao (Artemisia annua L).}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has saved millions of lives, especially in the [[developing world]].&lt;ref name="Tu  USA TODAY"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/story/2011-09-12/lasker-awards/50371124/1 |title = 'America's Nobel' awarded to Chinese scientist |publisher = ''[[USA Today]]'' |first = Elizabeth |last = Weise |date = 12 September 2011 |accessdate = 12 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tu also studied the [[chemical structure]] and pharmacology of artemisinin.&lt;ref name="L Award Description" /&gt; Tu's group first determined the chemical structure of artemisinin.
