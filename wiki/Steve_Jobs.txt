'''Steven Paul Jobs''' ({{IPAc-en|d||b|z}}; February 24, 1955  October 5, 2011) was an American entrepreneur and business magnate. He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), and a co-founder of [[Apple Inc.]], chairman and majority shareholder of [[Pixar]], a member of [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar, and the founder, chairman, and CEO of [[NeXT]]. Jobs and Apple co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]] are widely recognized as pioneers of the [[microcomputer revolution]] of the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;!-- The lack of citations is purposeful. Refer to Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section#Citations for more information. Wikipedia allows there to be little to no citations in the lead area if it is cited within the main body. If there is something in the lede not cited in the main part drop a {{not found in body}} citation needed tag and it will be addressed.  --&gt; 

Jobs was born in [[San Francisco]], California, to parents who put him up for adoption at birth. He was raised in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] during the 1960s. He attended [[Reed College]] in 1972 before dropping out that same year, and [[Hippie trail|traveled through India]] in 1974 seeking enlightenment and [[Buddhism in the West#Emerging mainstream western Buddhism|studying Zen Buddhism]]. His declassified FBI report states that he used [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] while he was in college, and he once told a reporter that taking LSD was "one of the two or three most important things" that he did in his life.

Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's [[Apple I]] personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later for the [[Apple II]], one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the [[Xerox Alto]] in 1979, which was [[computer mouse|mouse]]-driven and had a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI). This led to development of the unsuccessful [[Apple Lisa]] in 1983, followed by the breakthrough [[Macintosh 128K|Macintosh]] in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the [[desktop publishing]] industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple [[LaserWriter]], the first [[Laser printing|laser printer]] to feature [[vector graphics]]. Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 after a long power struggle. Jobs took a few of Apple's members with him to found [[NeXT]], a [[computer platform]] development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, he helped to develop the [[visual effects]] industry when he funded the computer graphics division of [[George Lucas]]'s [[Lucasfilm]] in 1986. The new company was [[Pixar]], which produced ''[[Toy Story]]'', the first fully [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] film.

Apple merged with NeXT in 1997, and Jobs became CEO of his former company within a few months. He was largely responsible for helping revive Apple, which had been at the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with designer [[Jony Ive]] to develop a line of products that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning in 1997 with the "[[Think different]]" advertising campaign and leading to the [[iMac]], [[iTunes]], [[iTunes Store]], [[Apple Store]], [[iPod]], [[iPhone]], [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], and the [[iPad]]. In 2001, the original [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]] was replaced with a completely new [[macOS|Mac OS X]], based on NeXT's [[NeXTSTEP]] platform, giving the OS a modern [[Unix]]-based foundation for the first time. Jobs was diagnosed with a [[pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor]] in 2003. He died at age 56 on October 5, 2011, of [[respiratory arrest]] related to the tumor.

== Background ==
===Biological and adoptive family===
Steven Paul Jobs was born to Abdulfattah Jandali and Joanne Schieble, and was adopted by Paul Jobs and Clara Hagopian.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/steve-jobs/8811345/Steve-Jobs-adopted-child-who-never-met-his-biological-father.html&lt;/ref&gt;

His biological father, Abdulfattah "John" [[List of people from Homs#Families|(al-)Jandali]] ([[Arabic]]:   ) (b. 1931), grew up in [[Homs]], Syria, and was born into an [[Arabs|Arab]] [[Muslim]] household.&lt;ref name="sg" /&gt; Jandali is the son of a self-made millionaire who did not go to college and a mother who was a traditional housewife.&lt;ref name="sg" /&gt; While an undergraduate at the [[American University of Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], he was a student activist and spent time in jail for his political activities.&lt;ref name="sg" /&gt; Although Jandali initially wanted to study [[law]], he eventually decided to study [[economics]] and [[political science]].&lt;ref name="sg" /&gt; He pursued a PhD in the latter subject at the [[University of Wisconsin]], where he met Joanne Carole Schieble (b. 1932), a Catholic of Swiss and German descent, who grew up on a farm in Wisconsin.&lt;ref name="sg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Graff|first1=Amy|title=Social media reminds us Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian migrant|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Steve-Jobs-son-of-Syrian-refugee-6640925.php|website=SFGate|publisher=Hearst Communications|accessdate=May 19, 2016|date=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a doctoral candidate, Jandali was a [[Graduate teaching assistant|teaching assistant]] for a course Schieble was taking, although both were the same age.&lt;ref name="conv" /&gt; [[Mona Simpson]], Jobs's biological sister, notes that her maternal grandparents were not happy that their daughter was dating Jandali: "it wasn't that he was Middle-Eastern so much as that he was a [[Muslim]]. But there are a lot of Arabs in Michigan and Wisconsin. So it's not that unusual."&lt;ref name="conv"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://bombmagazine.org/article/947/mona-simpson

Jobs's adoptive father, Paul Reinhold Jobs (19221993), grew up in a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] household,&lt;ref name="journeyisreward" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} the son of an "alcoholic and sometimes abusive" father.&lt;ref name="JobsBio1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter | authorlink =Walter Isaacson|title=[[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]]|year=2011|isbn= |page=|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]}}{{Pages needed|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} The family lived on a farm in [[Germantown, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref name="journeyisreward" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Paul bore an ostensible resemblance to [[James Dean]]; he had tattoos, dropped out of high school, and traveled around the Midwest for several years during the 1930s looking for work.&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref name="journeyisreward" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} He eventually joined the [[United States Coast Guard]] as an engine-room machinist.&lt;ref name="journeyisreward" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} After [[World War II]], Paul Jobs decided to leave the Coast Guard when his ship docked in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=journeyisreward/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} He made a bet that he would find his wife in San Francisco and promptly went on a blind date with Clara Hagopian (19241986). They were engaged ten days later and married in 1946.&lt;ref name="JobsBio1"/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Clara, the daughter of [[Armenians|Armenian]] immigrants, grew up in San Francisco and had been married before, but her husband had been killed in the war. After a series of moves, Paul and Clara settled in [[Sunset District, San Francisco|San Francisco's Sunset District]] in 1952.&lt;ref name="JobsBio1"/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} As a hobby, Paul Jobs rebuilt cars, but his career was as a "[[repossession|repo man]]", which suited his "aggressive, tough personality."&lt;ref name=journeyisreward/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Meanwhile, their attempts to start a family were halted after Clara had an [[ectopic pregnancy]], leading them to consider adoption in 1955.&lt;ref name="JobsBio1"/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}

Schieble became pregnant with Jobs in 1954 when she and Jandali spent the summer with his family in [[Homs]], Syria. Jandali has stated that he "was very much in love with Joanne ... but sadly, her father was a tyrant, and forbade her to marry me, as I was from Syria. And so she told me she wanted to give the baby up for adoption."&lt;ref name="waits"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2011/08/27/dad-waits-for-jobs-to-iphone/|title=Dad waits for Jobs to iPhone|accessdate=June 27, 2015|last=Staff|first=|date=August 27, 2011|work=[[New York Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs told his official biographer that Schieble's father was dying at the time, Schieble did not want to aggravate him, and both felt that at 23 they were too young to marry.&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} In addition, as there was a strong stigma against bearing a child out of wedlock and raising it as a single mother, and as abortions were illegal and dangerous, adoption was the only option women had in the United States in 1954.&lt;ref name=journeyisreward/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} According to Jandali, Schieble deliberately did not involve him in the process: "without telling me, Joanne upped and left to move to San Francisco to have the baby without anyone knowing, including me ... she did not want to bring shame onto the family and thought this was the best for everyone."&lt;ref name="waits" /&gt; Schieble put herself in the care of a "doctor who sheltered unwed mothers, delivered their babies, and quietly arranged closed adoptions."&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}

Schieble gave birth to Jobs on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco and chose an adoptive couple for him that was "Catholic, well-educated, and wealthy."&lt;ref name="bite" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} The couple changed their mind, however, and decided to adopt a girl instead.&lt;ref name="bite" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} The baby boy was then placed with the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar]] couple Paul and Clara Jobs, neither of whom had a college education, and Schieble refused to sign the adoption papers.&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} She then took the matter to court in an attempt to have her baby placed with a different family&lt;ref name="bite" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} and only consented to releasing the baby to Paul and Clara after they promised that he would attend college.&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} When Steve Jobs was in high school, his mother Clara admitted to his girlfriend, 17-year-old [[Chrisann Brennan]], that she "was too frightened to love [Steve] for the first six months of his life ... I was scared they were going to take him away from me. Even after we won the case, Steve was so difficult a child that by the time he was two I felt we had made a mistake. I wanted to return him."&lt;ref name="bite" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} When Chrisann shared his mother's comment with Steve, he stated that he was already aware of that&lt;ref name="bite" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} and would later say he was deeply loved and indulged by Paul and Clara.&lt;ref name="bsj" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Many years later, Steve Jobs's wife Laurene also noted that "he felt he had been really blessed by having the two of them as parents."&lt;ref name="bsj"&gt;{{cite web|titlelink=Becoming Steve Jobs|title=Becoming Steve Jobs: The Evolution of a Reckless Upstart into a Visionary Leader|accessdate=June 26, 2015|last=Schlender|first=Brent|last2=Tetzeli|first2=Rick|date=2015|publisher=Crown (ebook)}}{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Jobs would become upset when Paul and Clara were referred to as "adoptive parents" as they "were my parents 1,000%."&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} With regard to his biological parents, Jobs referred to them as "my sperm and egg bank. That's not harsh, it's just the way it was, a sperm bank thing, nothing more."&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Jandali has also stated that "I really am not his dad. Mr. and Mrs. Jobs are, as they raised him. And I don't want to take their place."&lt;ref name="waits" /&gt;

==Childhood==
{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="I always thought of myself as a humanities person as a kid, but I liked electronics  then I read something that one of my heroes, [[Edwin H. Land|Edwin Land of Polaroid]], said about the importance of people who could stand at the intersection of humanities and sciences, and I decided that's what I wanted to do."|source=Steve Jobs&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}}}
Paul and Clara adopted Jobs's sister Patricia in 1957&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} and the family moved to [[Mountain View, California]], in 1961.&lt;ref name=journeyisreward/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} It was during this time that Paul built a workbench in his garage for his son in order to "pass along his love of mechanics."&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Jobs, meanwhile, admired his father's craftsmanship "because he knew how to build anything. If we needed a cabinet, he would build it. When he built our fence, he gave me a hammer so I could work with him ... I wasn't that into fixing cars ... but I was eager to hang out with my dad."&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} By the time he was ten, Jobs was deeply involved in electronics and befriended many of the engineers who lived in the neighborhood.&lt;ref name=journeyisreward/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} He had difficulty making friends with children his own age, however, and was seen by his classmates as a "loner."&lt;ref name=journeyisreward/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}

[[File:Apple Garage.jpg|thumb|left|Childhood home of Steve Jobs in [[Los Altos, California]] that served as the original site of [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]].

Jobs had difficulty functioning in a traditional classroom, tended to resist authority figures, frequently misbehaved and was suspended a few times.&lt;ref name=journeyisreward/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Clara had taught him to read as a toddler, and Jobs stated that he was "pretty bored in school and [had] turned into a little terror... you should have seen us in the third grade, we basically destroyed the teacher."&lt;ref name=journeyisreward/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} He frequently played pranks on others at Monta Loma Elementary school in Mountain View.&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} His father Paul (who was abused as a child) never reprimanded him, however, and instead blamed the school for not placing enough challenge on his brilliant son.&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}

Jobs would later credit his fourth grade teacher, Imogene 'Teddy' Hill, with turning him around: "She taught an advanced fourth grade class and it took her about a month to get hip to my situation. She bribed me into learning. She would say, 'I really want you to finish this workbook. I'll give you five bucks if you finish it.' That really kindled a passion in me for learning things! I learned more that year than I think I learned in any other year in school. They wanted me to skip the next two years in grade school and go straight to junior high to learn a foreign language but my parents very wisely wouldn't let it happen."&lt;ref name=journeyisreward/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Jobs skipped the fifth grade and transferred to the sixth grade at Crittenden Middle School in Mountain View&lt;ref name="journeyisreward" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} where he became a "socially awkward loner."&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Jobs "was often bullied" and gave his parents an ultimatum: they had to either take him out of Crittenden or he would drop out of school.

Though the Jobs family was not well off, they used all their savings in 1967 to buy a new home, which would allow Jobs to change schools.&lt;ref name="journeyisreward" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} The new house (a three-bedroom home on Crist Drive in [[Los Altos, California]]) was in the better [[Cupertino Union School District|Cupertino School District]], [[Cupertino, California]],&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} and was embedded in an environment that was even more heavily populated with engineering families than the Mountain View home.&lt;ref name=journeyisreward/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} The house was declared a historic site in 2013 as it was the first site for Apple Computer&lt;ref name="hissite" /&gt; and is now owned by Patty and occupied by Jobs's step-mother Marilyn.&lt;ref name="piece"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_24193660/steve-jobs-old-garage-about-become-piece-history?source=pkg|title=Steve Jobs' old garage about to become a piece of history|work=mercurynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was 13 in 1968, Jobs was given a summer job by [[William Redington Hewlett|Bill Hewlett]] (of [[Hewlett-Packard]]) after Jobs cold-called him to ask for parts for an electronics project: "He didn't know me at all, but he ended up giving me some parts and he got me a job that summer working at Hewlett-Packard on the line, assembling frequency counters...well, assembling may be too strong. I was putting in screws. It didn't matter; I was in heaven."&lt;ref name="journeyisreward" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}

[[Bill Fernandez]], a fellow electronics hobbyist who was in Jobs's grade at Cupertino Junior High, was his first friend after the 1967 move. Fernandez later commented that "for some reason the kids in the eighth grade didn't like [Jobs] because they thought he was odd. I was one of his few friends." Fernandez eventually introduced Jobs to 18-year-old electronics whiz and Homestead High [[Alumnus|alum]] [[Steve Wozniak]], who lived across the street from Fernandez.

The location of the Los Altos home meant that Jobs would be able to attend nearby [[Homestead High School (Cupertino, California)|Homestead High School]], which had strong ties to [[Silicon Valley]].&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} He began his first year there in late 1968 along with Fernandez.&lt;ref name=journeyisreward/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Neither Jobs nor Fernandez (whose father was a lawyer) came from engineering households and thus decided to enroll in John McCollum's "Electronics 1."&lt;ref name="journeyisreward" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} McCollum and the rebellious Jobs (who had grown his hair long and become involved in the growing counterculture) would eventually clash and Jobs began to lose interest in the class. He also had no interest in sports and would later say that he didn't have what it took to "be a jock. I was always a loner."&lt;ref name=journeyisreward/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}

He underwent a change during mid-1970: "I got stoned for the first time; I discovered Shakespeare, [[Dylan Thomas]], and all that classic stuff. I read [[Moby Dick]] and went back as a junior taking creative writing classes."&lt;ref name=journeyisreward/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Jobs also later noted to his official biographer that "I started to listen to music a whole lot, and I started to read more outside of just science and technology[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Plato]]. I loved ''[[King Lear]]'' ... when I was a senior I had this phenomenal [[AP English Literature and Composition|AP English class]]. The teacher was this guy who looked like [[Ernest Hemingway]]. He took a bunch of us snowshoeing in Yosemite." From that point, Jobs developed two different circles of friends: those who were involved in electronics and engineering and those who were interested in art and literature.&lt;ref name="JobsBio1"/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} These dual interests were particularly reflected during Jobs's senior year as his best friends were Wozniak and his first girlfriend, the artistic Homestead junior [[Chrisann Brennan]].&lt;ref name="bite"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brennan |first=Chrisann |date= |title=The Bite in the Apple: A Memoir of My Life with Steve Jobs|titlelink=The Bite in the Apple |url= |location= |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |page=|isbn= |accessdate= |authorlink=Chrisann Brennan}}{{Pages needed|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}

In 1971 after Wozniak began attending [[University of California, Berkeley]], Jobs would visit him there a few times a week. This experience led him to study in nearby [[Stanford University]]'s student union. Jobs also decided that rather than join the electronics club, he would put on light shows with a friend for Homestead's avant-garde Jazz program. He was described by a Homestead classmate as "kind of a brain and kind of a hippie ... but he never fit into either group. He was smart enough to be a nerd, but wasn't nerdy. And he was too intellectual for the hippies, who just wanted to get wasted all the time. He was kind of an outsider. In high school everything revolved around what group you were in. and if you weren't in a carefully defined group, you weren't anybody. He was an individual, in a world where individuality was suspect." By his senior year in late 1971, he was taking freshman English class at Stanford and working on a Homestead underground film project with Chrisann.&lt;ref name=journeyisreward/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} In mid-1972, after graduation and before leaving for [[Reed College]], Jobs and Brennan rented a house from their other roommate, Al.&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref name="rs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://india.nydailynews.com/article/3ea39bee2a29179c3406250afd01c526/the-steve-jobs-nobody-knew|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425233149/http://india.nydailynews.com/article/3ea39bee2a29179c3406250afd01c526/the-steve-jobs-nobody-knew|archivedate=April 25, 2012|title=Jobs at 17: Nerd, Poet, Romantic

Later in the year, Jobs enrolled at [[Reed College]] in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Reed was an expensive school that Paul and Clara could ill afford, and they were spending much of their life savings on their son's higher education.&lt;ref name="JobsBio1"/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Brennan remained involved with Jobs while he was at Reed.

Brennan was now a senior at Homestead, and she did not have plans to attend college. She was supportive of Jobs when he told her that he planned to drop out of Reed because he did not want to spend his parents' money on it (neither her father nor Jobs's adoptive parents had gone to college). Jobs continued to attend by auditing his classes, which included a course on [[calligraphy]] that was taught by [[Robert Palladino]]. Jobs was no longer an official student, and Brennan stopped visiting him. Jobs later asked her to come and live with him in a house he rented near the Reed campus, but she refused. He had started seeing other women, and she was interested in someone she met in her art class. Brennan speculated that the house was Jobs's attempt to make their relationship monogamous again.&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} In a 2005 commencement speech at [[Stanford University]], Jobs stated that during this period, he slept on the floor in friends' dorm rooms, returned Coke bottles for food money, and got weekly free meals at the local [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] temple. In that same speech, Jobs said: "If I had never dropped in on that single [[calligraphy]] course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple [[typeface]]s or proportionally spaced fonts."&lt;ref name="commencementJune2005"&gt;{{cite news | title = Steve Jobs: Stanford commencement address, June 2005 |work=The Guardian | author = John Naughton | date = October 8, 2011 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/09/steve-jobs-stanford-commencement-address/print | location=London | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120211064825/http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/oct/09/steve-jobs-stanford-commencement-address/print | archivedate = February 11, 2012| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1972, Jobs moved back to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and was renting his own apartment. Brennan states by this point that their "relationship was complicated. I couldn't break the connection and I couldn't commit. Steve couldn't either." Jobs hitchhiked and worked around the West Coast and Brennan would occasionally join him. At the same time, Brennan notes, "little by little, Steve and I separated. But we were never able to fully let go. We never talked about breaking up or going our separate ways and we didn't have that conversation where one person says it's over." They continued to grow apart, but Jobs would still seek her out, and visit her while she was working in a health food store or as a live-in babysitter. They remained involved with each other while continuing to see other people.&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}
In 1973, [[Steve Wozniak]] designed his own version of the classic video game ''[[Pong]]''. After finishing it, Wozniak gave the board to Jobs, who then took the game down to [[Atari, Inc.]] in [[Los Gatos, California]]. Atari thought that Jobs had built it and gave him a job as a [[technician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2013/06/27/how-steve-wozniak-s-breakout-defined-apple-s-future.aspx |title=How Steve Wozniak's Breakout Defined Apple's Future|publisher=Gameinformer|date=June 27, 2013 |accessdate=February 13, 2014 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131101231442/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2013/06/27/how-steve-wozniak-s-breakout-defined-apple-s-future.aspx | archivedate = November 1, 2013| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="intoday1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/india-visit-gave-a-vision-to-steve-jobs/1/154785.html |title=An exclusive interview with Daniel Kottke |publisher=India Today |date=September 13, 2011 |accessdate=October 27, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67kIGLdKd?url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/india-visit-gave-a-vision-to-steve-jobs/1/154785.html |archivedate=May 18, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Atari's cofounder [[Nolan Bushnell]] later described him as "difficult but valuable", pointing out that "he was very often the smartest guy in the room, and he would let people know that."&lt;ref name="MercuryBushnell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/mike-cassidy/ci_22890892/cassidy-steve-jobs-hire-nolan-bushnell-book-atari |title=Cassidy on Nolan Bushnell: 'Steve was difficult,' says man who first hired Steve Jobs|publisher=Mercury News|date=March 29, 2013 |accessdate=April 2, 2013| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131206101225/http://www.mercurynews.com/mike-cassidy/ci_22890892/cassidy-steve-jobs-hire-nolan-bushnell-book-atari | archivedate = December 6, 2013| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 1973, Jobs was living what Brennan describes as a "simple life" in a [[Los Gatos, California|Los Gatos]] cabin, working at [[Atari]], and saving money for [[Hippie trail|his impending trip]] to [[India]]. Brennan visited him twice at the cabin. She states in her memoir that her memories of this cabin consist of Jobs reading ''[[Be Here Now (book)|Be Here Now]]'' (and giving her a copy), listening to [[South Indian culture#Music|South Indian]] music, and using a Japanese meditation pillow. Brennan felt that he was more distant and negative toward her. Brennan states in her memoir that she met with Jobs right before he left for [[India]] and that he tried to give her a $100 bill that he had earned at [[Atari]]. She initially refused to accept it but eventually accepted the money.&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt;{{rp|p=eBook|q=The morning of the day Steve left for India he came to my house to say good-bye and to give me a $100 bill.

Steve touched my forehead to indicate that I was his, which I found outrageous. When I objected to the money, Steve demanded I not play the game of rejecting it. Steve was nothing if not ceremonial in his passages and this money was about him, not me, so I took it and thanked him.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jobs then returned to Atari and was assigned to create a [[circuit board]] for the [[Arcade game|arcade]] video game ''[[Breakout (arcade game)|Breakout]]''. According to Bushnell, Atari offered {{USD|100}} for each [[Transistortransistor logic|TTL]] chip that was eliminated in the machine. Jobs had little specialized knowledge of circuit board design and made a deal with Wozniak to split the fee evenly between them if Wozniak could minimize the number of chips.

'Steve took me over to the garage. He had a circuit board with a chip on it, a DuMont TV set, a Panasonic cassette tape deck and a keyboard. He said, 'This is an Apple computer.' I said, 'You've got to be joking.' I dismissed the whole idea.'"&lt;ref name=piece/&gt; Jobs's friend from Reed College and India, and an early Apple employee, [[Daniel Kottke]], recalled that he "was the only person who worked in the garage ... Woz would show up once a week with his latest code. Steve Jobs didn't get his hands dirty in that sense." Kottke also stated that much of the early work took place in Jobs's kitchen, where he spent hours on the phone trying to find investors for the company.&lt;ref name=piece/&gt;

They received funding from a then-semi-retired [[Intel]] product marketing manager and engineer [[Mike Markkula]].&lt;ref name="Markkula1997"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/01/business/an-unknown-co-founder-leaves-after-20-years-of-glory-and-turmoil.html|title=An 'Unknown' Co-Founder Leaves After 20 Years of Glory and Turmoil|date=September 1, 1997|work=The New York Times|first=John|last=Markoff|accessdate=August 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scott McNealy]], one of the cofounders of [[Sun Microsystems]], said that Jobs broke a "[[glass ceiling|glass age ceiling]]" in Silicon Valley because he'd created a very successful company at a young age.&lt;ref name="Steve Jobs: Visionary Entrepreneur"/&gt;

After she returned from her own journey to India, Brennan visited Jobs at his parents' home, where he was still living. It was during this period that Jobs and Brennan fell in love again, as Brennan noted changes in him that she attributes to [[Kbun Chino Otogawa|Kobun]] (whom she was also still following). It was also at this time that Jobs displayed a prototype [[Apple I|Apple computer]] for Brennan and his parents in their living room. Brennan notes a shift in this time period, where the two main influences on Jobs were [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Kobun Chino Otogawa|Kobun]]. By the early 1977, she and Jobs would spend time together at her home at [[Hidden Villa|Duveneck Ranch in Los Altos]], which served as a hostel and environmental education center. Brennan also worked there as a teacher for inner city children who came to learn about the farm.&lt;ref name="bite" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}

In 1977, Jobs and Wozniak introduced the [[Apple II]] at the [[West Coast Computer Faire]]. It was the first consumer product sold by [[Apple Computer]] and was one of the first highly successful mass-produced [[microcomputer]] products,&lt;ref name="Ars Technica 2005-12-15"&gt;{{cite web|last=Reimer |first=Jeremy |url=https://arstechnica.com/features/2005/12/total-share/3/ |title=Total share: 30 years of personal computer market share figures |work=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Cond Nast]] |date=December 15, 2005 |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed primarily by [[Steve Wozniak]].

Jobs usually went to work wearing a black long-sleeved [[mock turtleneck]] made by [[Issey Miyake]] (it was sometimes reported as [[St. Croix (clothing)|St. Croix]] brand), [[Levi's]] 501 blue jeans, and [[New Balance]] 991 sneakers.&lt;ref name="latimes turtleneck"&gt;{{cite news|title=Steve Jobs' black turtleneck reportedly explained in biography |date=October 11, 2011 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/10/steve-jobs-explains-black-turtleneck-in-biography.html |work=The Los Angeles Times |accessdate=October 14, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62jOthLVF?url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/10/steve-jobs-explains-black-turtleneck-in-biography.html |archivedate=October 26, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmodo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/gadgets/pcs/wear-the-exact-outfit-of-steve-jobs-for-458-157402.php |title=Wear the Exact Outfit of Steve Jobs for $458 |publisher=Gizmodo |date=February 28, 2006 |accessdate=April 19, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65C7IQYkg?url=http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/pcs/wear-the-exact-outfit-of-steve-jobs-for-458-157402.php |archivedate=February 4, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said his choice was inspired by that of [[Stuart Geman]], a noted applied mathematics professor at Brown University. Jobs told his biographer Walter Isaacson "...he came to like the idea of having a uniform for himself, both because of its daily convenience (the rationale he claimed) and its ability to convey a signature style."&lt;ref name="latimes turtleneck" /&gt;

As Jobs became more successful with his new company, his relationship with Brennan grew more complex. In 1977, the success of Apple was now a part of their relationship, and Brennan, [[Daniel Kottke]], and Jobs moved into a house near the Apple office in [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]].&lt;ref name="bite" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Brennan eventually took a position in the shipping department at Apple .&lt;ref name="bite" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref name="standingphoto"&gt;{{cite web

|work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brennan's relationship with Jobs was deteriorating as his position with Apple grew, and she began to consider ending the relationship through small changes. In October 1977, Brennan was approached by [[Rod Holt]], who asked her to take "a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples."&lt;ref name="bite" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Both Holt and Jobs felt that it would be a good position for her, given her artistic abilities. Holt was particularly eager that she take the position and puzzled by her ambivalence toward it. Brennan's decision, however, was overshadowed by the fact that she realized she was pregnant and that Jobs was the father. It took her a few days to tell Jobs, whose face, according to Brennan "turned ugly" at the news. At the same time, according to Brennan, at the beginning of her third trimester, Jobs said to her: "I never wanted to ask that you get an abortion. I just didn't want to do that."&lt;ref name="bite" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} He also refused to discuss the pregnancy with her.&lt;ref name="JobsBio1"/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Brennan herself felt confused about what to do. She was estranged from her mother and afraid to discuss the matter with her father. She also did not feel comfortable with the idea of having an abortion. She chose instead to discuss the matter with Kobun, who encouraged her to have and keep the baby, and pledged his support. Meanwhile, Holt was waiting for her decision on the internship. Brennan stated that Jobs continued to encourage her to take the internship, stating she could "be pregnant and work at Apple, you can take the job. I don't get what the problem is."&lt;ref name="bite" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Brennan however notes that she "felt so ashamed: the thought of my growing belly in the professional environment at Apple, with the child being his, while he was unpredictable, in turn being punishing and sentimentally ridiculous. I could not have endured it."&lt;ref name="bite" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}

Brennan turned down the internship and decided to leave Apple. She stated that Jobs told her "If you give up this baby for adoption, you will be sorry" and "I am never going to help you."&lt;ref name="bite" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Now alone, Brennan was on welfare and cleaning houses to earn money. She would sometimes ask Jobs for money but he always refused. Brennan hid her pregnancy for as long as she could, living in a variety of homes and continuing her work with Zen meditation. At the same time, according to Brennan, Jobs "started to seed people with the notion that I slept around and he was infertile, which meant that this could not be his child." A few weeks before she was due to give birth, Brennan was invited to deliver her baby at the All One Farm and she accepted the offer.&lt;ref name="bite" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} When Jobs was 23 (the same age as his biological parents when they had him)&lt;ref name="JobsBio1"/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Brennan gave birth to her baby, [[Lisa Brennan-Jobs|Lisa Brennan]], on May 17, 1978.&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref name="pens"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/15/steve-jobs-chrisann-brennan-memoir-apple

{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="Dear [[Mike Markkula|Mike]], This morning's papers carried suggestions that Apple is considering removing me as chairman. I don't know the source of these reports, but they are both misleading to the public and unfair to me. You will recall that at last Thursday's Board meeting I stated I had decided to start a new venture, and I tendered my resignation as chairman. The Board declined to accept my resignation and asked me to defer it for a week. I agreed to do so in light of the encouragement the Board offered with regard to the proposed new venture and the indications that Apple would invest in it. On Friday, after I told John Sculley who would be joining me, he confirmed Apple's willingness to discuss areas of possible collaboration between Apple and my new venture. Subsequently the Company appears to be adopting a hostile posture toward me and the new venture. Accordingly, I must insist upon the immediate acceptance of my resignation. I would hope that in any statement it feels it must issue, the Company will make it clear that the decision to resign as chairman was mine. I find myself both saddened and perplexed by the management's conduct in this matter which seems to me contrary to Apple's best interests. Those interests remain a matter of deep concern to me, both because of my past association with Apple and the substantial investment I retain in it. I continue to hope that calmer voices within the Company may yet be heard. Some Company representatives have said they fear I will use proprietary Apple technology in my new venture. There is no basis for any such concern. If that concern is the real source of Apple's hostility to the venture, I can allay it. As you know, the company's recent re-organization left me with no work to do and no access even to regular management reports. I am but 30 and want still to contribute and achieve. After what we have accomplished together, I would wish our parting to be both amicable and dignified. Yours sincerely, Steven P.

Jobs went there for the birth after he was contacted by [[Robert Friedland]], their mutual friend and the farm owner. While distant, Jobs worked with her on a name for the baby, which they discussed while sitting in the fields on a blanket. Brennan suggested the name "Lisa" which Jobs also liked and notes that Jobs was very attached to the name "Lisa" while he "was also publicly denying paternity." She would discover later that during this time, Jobs was preparing to unveil a new kind of computer that he wanted to give a female name (his first choice was "Claire" after [[Clare of Assisi|St. Clare]]). She also stated that she never gave him permission to use the baby's name for a computer and he hid the plans from her. Jobs also worked with his team to come up with the phrase, "Local Integrated Software Architecture" as an [[backronym|alternative explanation]] for the [[Apple Lisa]].&lt;ref name="Bullock"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minyanville.com/special-features/articles/lisa-brennan-jobs-business-icons-rich/8/31/2010/id/29768|title= The Kids of Business Icons: Lisa Brennan-Jobs |last=Bullock |first= Diane |date=August 31, 2010|work=[[Minyanville]] |pages=|accessdate=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decades later, however, Jobs admitted to his biographer [[Walter Isaacson]] that "obviously, it was named for my daughter".&lt;ref name="JobsBio1"/&gt;{{rp|93}} Brennan would come under intense criticism from Jobs, who claimed that "she doesn't want money, she just wants me." According to Brennan, Apple's [[Michael Scott (Apple)|Mike Scott]] wanted Jobs to give her money, while other Apple executives "advised him to ignore me or fight if I tried to go after a paternity settlement."&lt;ref name="bite" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}

When Jobs denied paternity, a [[DNA paternity testing|DNA test]] established him as Lisa's father. It required him to give Brennan $385 a month in addition to returning the welfare money she had received. Jobs gave her $500 a month at the time when Apple went public, and Jobs became a millionaire. Brennan worked as a waitress in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]]. Later, Brennan agreed to give an interview with [[Michael Moritz]] for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine for its [[Time Person of the Year]] special, released on January 3, 1983, in which she discussed her relationship with Jobs. Rather than name Jobs the Person of the Year, the magazine named the computer the "Machine of the Year".&lt;ref&gt;"Machine of the Year: The Computer Moves in". [[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', January 3, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; In the issue, Jobs questioned the reliability of the paternity test (which stated that the "probability of paternity for Jobs, Steven... is 94.1%").&lt;ref name="machineofthe year1"&gt;Cocks Jay. Reported by Michael Moritz. "[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953633,00.html The Updated Book of Jobs]" in ''Machine of the Year: The Computer Moves in.'' [[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', January 3, 1983:27.&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs responded by arguing that "28% of the male population of the United States could be the father."&lt;ref name="bite"/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref name="machineofthe year1"/&gt; ''Time'' also noted that "the baby girl and the machine on which Apple has placed so much hope for the future share the same name: Lisa."&lt;ref name="machineofthe year1"/&gt;

Jobs was worth a million dollars when he was 23 in 1978, 10 million when he was 24, and over 100 million when he was 25.{{fact|date=March 2018}} He was also one of the youngest "people ever to make the [[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]] list of the nation's richest peopleand one of only a handful to have done it themselves, without inherited wealth."&lt;ref name=journeyisreward/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}

In 1978, Apple recruited [[Michael Scott (Apple)|Mike Scott]] from [[National Semiconductor]] to serve as CEO for what turned out to be several turbulent years. In 1983, Jobs lured [[John Sculley]] away from [[Pepsi-Cola]] to serve as Apple's CEO, asking, "Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?"{{r|JobsBio1|pp=386387|q=[[John Sculley]] quotes Jobs saying this to official biographer [[Walter Isaacson]], on page 386387 of ''[[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]]''}}

In 1982, Jobs bought an apartment in the two top floors of [[The San Remo]], a Manhattan building with a politically progressive reputation. Although he never lived there,&lt;ref name=wirdem&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/02/steve-jobs-house-dem/ |title=Photos: The Historic House Steve Jobs Demolished |work=Wired | date=February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; he spent years renovating it with the help of [[I. M. Pei]]. In 2003, he sold it to [[U2]] singer [[Bono (U2)|Bono]].

In 1984, Jobs bought the [[Jackling House]] and estate, and resided there for a decade. After that, he leased it out for several years until 2000 when he stopped maintaining the house, allowing exposure to the weather to degrade it. In 2004, Jobs received permission from the town of Woodside to demolish the house in order to build a smaller contemporary styled one. After a few years in court, the house was finally demolished in 2011, a few months before he died.&lt;ref name=sfch11&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/02/14/BAUK1HN0JR.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Henry K. | last=Lee | title=Steve Jobs' historic Woodside mansion is torn down | date=February 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1984, Apple introduced the [[Macintosh]], which was based on [[Apple Lisa|The Lisa]] (and [[PARC user interface|Xerox PARC's]] [[computer mouse|mouse]]-driven [[graphical user interface]]).&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2004/01/61730 |title=Wired News: We're All Mac Users Now |work=Wired News |accessdate=September 20, 2006 |last=Kahney |first=Leander |date=January 6, 2004 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140104172110/http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2004/01/61730 | archivedate = January 4, 2014| deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jobsjourney"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/storysupplement/stevejobs/index.html |title=America's Most Admired Companies: Jobs' journey timeline |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |accessdate=May 24, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410024515/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/storysupplement/stevejobs/index.html |archivedate=April 10, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }} Jobs and a team of engineers visit Xerox PARC, where they see a demo of mouse and graphical user interface&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Apple aired a [[Super Bowl]] television commercial titled "[[1984 (television commercial)|1984]]." At Apple's annual shareholders meeting on January 24, 1984, an emotional Jobs introduced the [[Macintosh]] to a wildly enthusiastic audience; [[Andy Hertzfeld]] described the scene as "pandemonium."&lt;ref name="The Times They Are A-Changin'"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=The_Times_They_Are_A-Changin.txt |title=The Times They Are A-Changin' |first=Andy |last=Hertzfeld |authorlink=Andy Hertzfeld |publisher=folklore.org |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65C71tiuS?url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=The_Times_They_Are_A-Changin.txt |archivedate=February 4, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fanfare, the expensive Macintosh was a hard sell.&lt;ref name="swaine1"&gt;Swaine, Michael and Paul Frieberger. ''Fire in the Valley: The Birth and Death of the Personal Computer'', 3rd Edition, Dallas: Pragmatic Bookshelf, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|308309}} Shortly after its release in 1985, [[Bill Gates]]'s then-developing company, [[Microsoft]], threatened to stop developing Mac applications unless it was granted "a license for the Mac operating system software. Microsoft was developing its graphical user interface ... for DOS, which it was calling [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and didn't want Apple to sue over the similarities between the Windows GUI and the Mac interface."&lt;ref name=swaine1/&gt;{{rp|321}} Sculley granted Microsoft the license which later led to problems for Apple.&lt;ref name=swaine1/&gt;{{rp|321}} In addition, cheap [[IBM PC compatible|IBM PC clones]] that ran on Microsoft software and had a graphical user interface began to appear. Although the Macintosh preceded the clones, it was far more expensive, so "through the late 80s, the Windows user interface was getting better and better and was thus taking increasingly more share from Apple."&lt;ref name=swaine1/&gt;{{rp|322}} Windows-based IBM-PC clones also led to the development of additional GUIs such as IBM's TopView or Digital Research's GEM,&lt;ref name=swaine1/&gt;{{rp|322}} and thus "the graphical user interface was beginning to be taken for granted, undermining the most apparent advantage of the Mac...it seemed clear as the 80s wound down that Apple couldn't go it alone indefinitely against the whole IBM-clone market."&lt;ref name=swaine1/&gt;{{rp|322}}

Sculley's and Jobs's respective visions for the company greatly differed. The former favored [[open architecture]] computers like the Apple II, sold to education, small business, and home markets less vulnerable to IBM. Jobs wanted the company to focus on the [[closed architecture]] Macintosh as a business alternative to the IBM PC. President and CEO Sculley had little control over chairman of the board Jobs's Macintosh division; it and the Apple II division operated like separate companies, duplicating services.&lt;ref name="robbeloth198510_11"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/II_Computing_Vol_1_No_1_Oct_Nov_85_Premiere#page/n7/mode/2up | title=Whither Apple? | work=II Computing | date=OctNov 1985 | accessdate=January 28, 2015 | author=Robbeloth, DeWitt | page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although its products provided 85 percent of Apple's sales in early 1985, the company's January 1985 [[annual meeting]] did not mention the Apple II division or employees.

In May 1985, Sculleyencouraged by Arthur Rockdecided to reorganize Apple, and proposed a plan to the board that would remove Jobs from the Macintosh group and put him in charge of "New Product Development." This move would effectively render Jobs powerless within Apple.&lt;ref name=journeyisreward/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} In response, Jobs then developed a plan to get rid of Sculley and take over Apple. However, Jobs was confronted after the plan was leaked, and he said that he would leave Apple. The Board declined his resignation and asked him to reconsider. Sculley also told Jobs that he had all of the votes needed to go ahead with the reorganization. A few months later, on September 17, 1985, Jobs submitted a letter of resignation to the Apple Board. Five additional senior Apple employees also resigned and joined Jobs in his new venture, [[NeXT]].&lt;ref name=journeyisreward&gt;{{cite web|title=Steve Jobs: The Journey Is the Reward|last=Young|first=Jeffrey S.|date=1987|publisher=Amazon Digital Services, 2011 ebook edition (originally [[Scott Foresman]])}}{{Pages needed|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}

Following his resignation from Apple in 1985, Jobs founded [[NeXT|NeXT Inc.]]&lt;ref name="Apple's Jobs Starts New Firm, Targets Education Market"&gt;{{cite news| last = Spector| first = G| title = Apple's Jobs Starts New Firm, Targets Education Market| work = [[PC Week]]| page = 109| date = September 24, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; with $7&amp;nbsp;million. A year later he was running out of money, and he sought venture capital with no product on the horizon. Eventually, Jobs attracted the attention of billionaire [[Ross Perot]], who invested heavily in the company.&lt;ref name="Linzmayer04"/&gt; The NeXT computer was shown to the world in what was considered Jobs's comeback event,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Schwartz |first=John |date=October 24, 1988 |title=Steve Jobs Comes Back |newspaper=Newsweek |page=Business |location=Palo Alto, California |url=http://www.newsweek.com/steve-jobs-comes-back-207006 |accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a lavish invitation only gala [[NeXT Introduction|launch event]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kevra.org/TheBestOfNext/Timeline/TImeline.html|title=NeXT Timeline|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was described as a multimedia extravaganza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schlender |first=Brenton R. |date=October 13, 1988 |title=Next Project: Apple Era Behind Him, Steve Jobs Tries Again, Using a New System |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |page=Front Page Leader |edition=Western |location=Palo Alto, California |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company|Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc]] |url=http://tech-insider.org/unix/research/1988/1013.html |accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebration was held at the [[Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall]], San Francisco, California on Wednesday October 12, 1988. [[Steve Wozniak]] said in a 2013 interview that while Jobs was at NeXT he was "really getting his head together".&lt;ref name=TheVerge/&gt;

NeXT workstations were first released in 1990 and priced at {{USD|9,999}}. Like the [[Apple Lisa]], the NeXT workstation was technologically advanced and designed for the education sector, but was largely dismissed as cost-prohibitive for educational institutions.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;Rose, F. (April 23, 2009). {{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/08/the-end-of-inno/ |title=The End of Innocence at Apple: What Happened After Steve Jobs was Fired |work=Wired |first=Frank |last=Rose |date=August 24, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62GHBNkt4?url=http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/08/the-end-of-inno/ |archivedate=October 7, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}. ''Wired''.&lt;/ref&gt; The NeXT workstation was known for its technical strengths, chief among them its [[object-oriented]] software development system. Jobs marketed NeXT products to the financial, scientific, and academic community, highlighting its innovative, experimental new technologies, such as the [[Mach kernel]], the [[digital signal processor]] chip, and the built-in [[Ethernet]] port. Making use of a NeXT computer, English computer scientist [[Tim Berners-Lee]] invented the [[World Wide Web]] in 1989 at [[CERN]] in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to info.cern.ch: The website of the world's first-ever web server |url=http://info.cern.ch/ |year=2008 |publisher=CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) |accessdate=November 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5msT2iV3b?url=http://info.cern.ch/ |archivedate=January 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revised, second generation [[NeXTcube]] was released in 1990. Jobs touted it as the first "interpersonal" computer that would replace the personal computer. With its innovative [[NeXTMail]] multimedia email system, NeXTcube could share voice, image, graphics, and video in email for the first time. "Interpersonal computing is going to revolutionize human communications and groupwork", Jobs told reporters.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;''Computimes''. (May 31, 1990).

''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs ran NeXT with an obsession for aesthetic perfection, as evidenced by the development of and attention to NeXTcube's magnesium case.&lt;ref name="atheneum"&gt;Stross, R.

Atheneum. {{ISBN|978-0-689-12135-7}}. pp. 117, 120, 246.&lt;/ref&gt; This put considerable strain on NeXT's hardware division, and in 1993, after having sold only 50,000 machines, NeXT transitioned fully to software development with the release of [[NeXTSTEP]]/[[Intel]].&lt;ref name="OGrady"&gt;O'Grady, J. (2008). ''Apple Inc.'' Greenwood Press. {{ISBN|978-0-313-36244-6}}.{{Pages needed|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company reported its first profit of $1.03&amp;nbsp;million in 1994.&lt;ref name="Linzmayer04"/&gt; In 1996, NeXT Software, Inc. released [[WebObjects]], a framework for Web application development. After NeXT was acquired by Apple Inc. in 1997, WebObjects was used to build and run the [[Apple Store]],&lt;ref name="OGrady"/&gt; [[MobileMe]] services, and the [[iTunes Store]].

===Pixar and Disney===
In 1986, Jobs funded the spinout of The Graphics Group (later renamed [[Pixar]]) from [[Lucasfilm]]'s computer graphics division for the price of $10&amp;nbsp;million, $5&amp;nbsp;million of which was given to the company as capital and $5&amp;nbsp;million of which was paid to Lucasfilm for technology rights.&lt;ref name="Pixar Founding Documents"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alvyray.com/pixar/default.htm|title=Pixar Founding Documents|last=Smith|first=Alvy Ray|authorlink=Alvy Ray Smith|website=Alvy Ray Smith Homepage|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050427012806/http://alvyray.com/Pixar/default.htm|archivedate=April 27, 2005|deadurl=yes|accessdate=January 11, 2011|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first film produced by Pixar with its [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] partnership, ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), with Jobs credited as executive producer,&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/fullcredits |work=IMDB |title="Toy Story" Credits |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68egeDIFl?url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/fullcredits |archivedate=June 24, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; brought fame and critical acclaim to the studio when it was released. Over the next 15 years, under Pixar's creative chief [[John Lasseter]], the company produced box-office hits ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' (1998); ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' (1999); ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' (2001); ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' (2003); ''[[The Incredibles]]'' (2004); ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' (2006); ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'' (2007); ''[[WALL-E]]'' (2008); ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' (2009); and ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' (2010). ''Finding Nemo'', ''The Incredibles'', ''Ratatouille'', ''WALL-E'', ''Up'' and ''Toy Story 3'' each received the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]], an award introduced in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2012/02/05/steve-jobs-bio-reveals-how-michael-eisner-actively-tried-to-derail-disney-s-acquisition-of-pixar.aspx |title=Steve Jobs bio reveals how Michael Eisner actively tried to derail Disney's 2006 acquisition of Pixar |publisher=Jim Hill Media |date=February 5, 2012 |accessdate=February 10, 2012 |author=Hill, Jim |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68ebHJE5f?url=http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2012/02/05/steve-jobs-bio-reveals-how-michael-eisner-actively-tried-to-derail-disney-s-acquisition-of-pixar.aspx |archivedate=June 24, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 and 2004, as Pixar's contract with Disney was running out, Jobs and Disney chief executive [[Michael Eisner]] tried but failed to negotiate a new partnership,&lt;ref name="vanityfair"&gt;Wolff, Michael, {{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2006/04/wolff200604?currentPage=all |title=iPod, Therefore I am | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140328111011/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2006/04/wolff200604?currentPage=all | archivedate = March 28, 2014| deadurl=no}}, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', April 2006. Retrieved September 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and in early 2004, Jobs announced that Pixar would seek a new partner to distribute its films after its contract with Disney expired.

In October 2005, [[Bob Iger]] replaced Eisner at Disney, and Iger quickly worked to mend relations with Jobs and Pixar. On January 24, 2006, Jobs and Iger announced that Disney had agreed to purchase Pixar in an all-stock transaction worth $7.4&amp;nbsp;billion. When the deal closed, Jobs became [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s largest single shareholder with approximately seven percent of the company's stock.&lt;ref name="DisneyBuysPixar"&gt;January 25, 2006 {{cite web |url=http://inhome.rediff.com/money/2006/jan/25disney.htm |title= Disney buys Pixar for $7.4 bn | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131109012018/http://inhome.rediff.com/money/2006/jan/25disney.htm | archivedate = November 9, 2013| deadurl=no}}, rediff.com&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs's holdings in Disney far exceeded those of Eisner, who holds 1.7%, and of Disney family member [[Roy E. Disney]], who until his 2009 death held about 1% of the company's stock and whose criticisms of Eisnerespecially that he soured Disney's relationship with Pixaraccelerated Eisner's ousting. Upon completion of the merger, Jobs received 7% of Disney shares, and joined the board of directors as the largest individual shareholder.&lt;ref name="DisneyBuysPixar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Disney"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/corporate/bios/steve_jobs.html|title=The Walt Disney Company  Steve Jobs Biography}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=January 17, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/25/business/25disney.html|title=Disney Agrees to Acquire Pixar in a $7.4&amp;nbsp;Billion Deal|work=The New York Times|first=Laura M.|last=Holson|date=January 25, 2006}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=January 17, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/06/business/media/06pixar.html|title=Pixar Becomes Unit of Disney|work=The New York Times|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=May 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.splashnology.com/article/steve-jobs-1955-%E2%80%93-2011/2961/ |title=Steve Jobs, 19552011 |publisher=Splashnogly |date=October 6, 2011 |accessdate=January 15, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66kgtxT7j?url=http://www.splashnology.com/article/steve-jobs-1955-%E2%80%93-2011/2961/ |archivedate=April 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Jobs's death his shares in Disney were transferred to the Steven P.

[[Floyd Norman]], of Pixar, described Jobs as a "mature, mellow individual" who never interfered with the creative process of the filmmakers.&lt;ref name="Steve Jobs: A Tough Act to Follow"&gt;{{cite news|first=Floyd|last=Norman|authorlink=Floyd Norman|title=Steve Jobs: A Tough Act to Follow |publisher=Jim Hill Media |date=January 19, 2009|url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/floyd_norman/archive/2009/01/19/steve-jobs-a-tough-act-to-follow.aspx|accessdate=January 19, 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100508103204/http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/floyd_norman/archive/2009/01/19/steve-jobs-a-tough-act-to-follow.aspx | archivedate = May 8, 2010| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early June 2014, Pixar cofounder and [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] President Ed Catmull revealed that Jobs once advised him to "just explain it to them until they understand" in disagreements. Catmull released the book ''[[Creativity, Inc.]]'' in 2014, in which he recounts numerous experiences of working with Jobs. Regarding his own manner of dealing with Jobs, Catmull writes:&lt;ref name=Creativity&gt;{{Cite book| title = Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration| language = English| publisher = [[Transworld Publishers Limited]]| isbn = 978-0552167260| first1 = Edwin|last1= Catmull |first2=Amy|last2= Wallace | authorlink1=Edwin Catmull| titlelink = Creativity, Inc.| date = {{date|2014|04|08}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}

I'd call him up and I give my counter argument to what he had said and he'd immediately shoot it down. So I had to wait another week, and sometimes this went on for months.

And it was another third of the time in which [I'd] say, 'Actually I think he is right.'

===Family===

[[Chrisann Brennan]] notes that after Jobs was forced out of Apple, "he apologized many times over for his behavior" towards her and Lisa. She also states that Jobs "said that he never took responsibility when he should have, and that he was sorry."&lt;ref name="bite" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} By this time, Jobs had developed a strong relationship with Lisa and when she was nine, Jobs had her name on her birth certificate changed from "Lisa Brennan" to "[[Lisa Brennan-Jobs]]."&lt;ref name="bite" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} In addition, Jobs and Brennan developed a working relationship to [[co-parent]] Lisa, a change Brennan credits to the influence of his newly found biological sister, [[Mona Simpson]] (who worked to repair the relationship between Lisa and Jobs).&lt;ref name="bite" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Jobs found Mona after first finding his birth mother, Joanne Schieble Simpson, shortly after he left Apple.&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}

Jobs did not contact his birth family during his adoptive mother Clara's lifetime, however. He would later tell his official biographer [[Walter Isaacson]]: "I never wanted [Paul and Clara] to feel like I didn't consider them my parents, because they were totally my parents [...] I loved them so much that I never wanted them to know of my search, and I even had reporters keep it quiet when any of them found out."&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} However, in 1986 when he was 31, Clara was diagnosed with lung cancer. He began to spend a great deal of time with her and learned more details about her background and his adoption, information that motivated him to find his biological mother. Jobs found on his birth certificate the name of the San Francisco doctor to whom Schieble had turned when she was pregnant. Although the doctor did not help Jobs while he was alive, he left a letter for Jobs to be opened upon his death. As he died soon afterwards, Jobs was given the letter which stated that "his mother had been an unmarried graduate student from Wisconsin named Joanne Schieble."&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}

Jobs only contacted Schieble after Clara died and after he received permission from his father, Paul. In addition, out of respect for Paul, he asked the media not to report on his search.&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Jobs stated that he was motivated to find his birth mother out of both curiosity and a need "to see if she was okay and to thank her, because I'm glad I didn't end up as an abortion. She was twenty-three and she went through a lot to have me."&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Schieble was emotional during their first meeting (though she wasn't familiar with the history of Apple or Jobs's role in it) and told him that she had been pressured into signing the adoption papers. She said that she regretted giving him up and repeatedly apologized to him for it. Jobs and Schieble would develop a friendly relationship throughout the rest of his life and would spend Christmas together.&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}

During this first visit, Schieble told Jobs that he had a sister, Mona, who was not aware that she had a brother.&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Schieble then arranged for them to meet in New York where Mona worked. Her first impression of Jobs was that "he was totally straightforward and lovely, just a normal and sweet guy."&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Simpson and Jobs then went for a long walk to get to know each other.&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Jobs later told his biographer that "Mona was not completely thrilled at first to have me in her life and have her mother so emotionally affectionate toward me . . . . As we got to know each other, we became really good friends, and she is my family. I don't know what I'd do without her. I can't imagine a better sister. My adopted sister, Patty, and I were never close."&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}

{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="I grew up as an only child, with a single mother. Because we were poor and because I knew my father had emigrated from Syria, I imagined he looked like [[Omar Sharif]]. I hoped he would be rich and kind and would come into our lives (and our not-yet-furnished apartment) and help us. Later, after I'd met my father, I tried to believe he'd changed his number and left no forwarding address because he was an idealistic revolutionary, plotting a new world for the Arab people. Even as a feminist, my whole life I'd been waiting for a man to love, who could love me. For decades, I'd thought that man would be my father. When I was 25, I met that man, and he was my brother."|source=[[Mona Simpson]]&lt;ref name="eulogy" /&gt;}}

Jobs then learned his family history. Six months after he was given up for adoption, Schieble's father died, she wed Jandali, and they had a daughter, Mona.&lt;ref name=sg&gt;{{cite web

We lost touch again when her mother moved and I didn't know where she was, but since 10 years ago we've been in constant contact, and I see her three times a year. I organized a trip for her last year to visit Syria and Lebanon and she went with a relative from Florida.&lt;ref name=sg/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; A few years later, Schieble married an ice skating teacher, George Simpson. Mona Jandali took her stepfather's last name and thus became Mona Simpson. In 1970, after they divorced, Schieble took Mona to Los Angeles and raised her on her own.&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}

Jobs told his official biographer that after meeting Simpson, he wanted to become involved in her ongoing search for their father. When he was found working in Sacramento, they decided that only Simpson would meet him. Jandali and Simpson spoke for several hours at which point he told her that he had left teaching for the restaurant business. He also said that he and Schieble had given another child away for adoption but that "we'll never see that baby again. That baby's gone." (Simpson did not mention that she had met Jobs).&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Jandali further told Simpson that he once managed a Mediterranean restaurant near [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] and that "all of the successful technology people used to come there. Even Steve Jobs ... oh yeah, he used to come in, and he was a sweet guy and a big tipper."&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} After hearing about the visit, Jobs recalled that "it was amazing .... I had been to that restaurant a few times, and I remember meeting the owner. He was Syrian. Balding. We shook hands."&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} However, Jobs did not want to meet Jandali because "I was a wealthy man by then, and I didn't trust him not to try to blackmail me or go to the press about it ... I asked Mona not to tell him about me."&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Jandali later discovered his relationship to Jobs through an online blog. He then contacted Simpson and asked "what is this thing about Steve Jobs?" Simpson told him that it was true and later commented, "My father is thoughtful and a beautiful storyteller, but he is very, very passive ... He never contacted Steve."&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Because Simpson, herself, researched her Syrian roots and began to meet members of the family, she assumed that Jobs would eventually want to meet their father, but he never did.&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Jobs also never showed an interest in his Syrian heritage or the Middle East.&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Simpson fictionalized the search for their father in the 1992 novel, ''[[The Lost Father]]''.&lt;ref name="JobsBio1" /&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} [[Malek Jandali]] is their cousin.&lt;ref&gt;https://hammer.ucla.edu/programs-events/2012/07/malek-jandali-mona-simpson-james-gelvin&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Jobs first met his future wife, [[Laurene Powell Jobs|Laurene Powell]], when he gave a lecture at the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]], where she was a student. Soon after the event, he stated that Laurene "was right there in the front row in the lecture hall, and I couldn't take my eyes off of her ... kept losing my train of thought, and started feeling a little giddy."&lt;ref name=bsj/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} After the lecture, Jobs met up with her in the parking lot and invited her out to dinner. From that point forward, they were together, with a few minor exceptions, for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=bsj/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} Powell's father died when she was very young, and her mother raised her in a middle class [[New Jersey]] home similar to the one Jobs grew up in. After she received her BA from the [[University of Pennsylvania]], she spent a short period in high finance but found it didn't interest her, so she decided to pursue her MBA at Stanford instead. In addition, unlike Jobs, she was athletic and followed professional sports.

In 1996, Apple announced that it would buy [[NeXT]] for $427&amp;nbsp;million. The deal was finalized in February 1997,&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/product.info.apple.com/pr/press.releases/1997/q2/970207.pr.rel.next.html |date=* |title=Apple Computer, Inc.

Jobs became ''de facto'' chief after then-CEO [[Gil Amelio]] was ousted in July 1997. He was formally named interim chief executive in September.&lt;ref name="Apple Formally Names Jobs as Interim Chief"&gt;{{cite news|title=Apple Formally Names Jobs as Interim Chief|work=The New York Times |accessdate=June 27, 2011|date=September 17, 1997|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/091797apple.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1998, to concentrate Apple's efforts on returning to profitability, Jobs terminated a number of projects, such as [[Newton (platform)|Newton]], [[Cyberdog]], and [[OpenDoc]]. In the coming months, many employees developed a fear of encountering Jobs while riding in the elevator, "afraid that they might not have a job when the doors opened. The reality was that Jobs's summary executions were rare, but a handful of victims was enough to terrorize a whole company."&lt;ref name="The once and future Steve Jobs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.salon.com/tech/books/2000/10/11/jobs_excerpt/index2.html|title=The once and future Steve Jobs|date=October 11, 2000|work=Salon.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416051238/http://archive.salon.com/tech/books/2000/10/11/jobs_excerpt/index2.html|archivedate=April 16, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs changed the licensing program for [[Macintosh clones]], making it too costly for the manufacturers to continue making machines.

With the purchase of NeXT, much of the company's technology found its way into Apple products, most notably [[NeXTSTEP]], which evolved into [[Mac OS X]]. Under Jobs's guidance, the company increased sales significantly with the introduction of the [[iMac]] and other new products; since then, appealing designs and powerful branding have worked well for Apple. At the 2000 Macworld Expo, Jobs officially dropped the "interim" modifier from his title at Apple and became permanent CEO.&lt;ref name="norr"&gt;{{cite news|last=Norr|first=Henry|title=MacWorld Expo/Permanent Jobs/Apple CEO finally drops 'interim' from title|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=June 27, 2011|date=January 6, 2000|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2000-01-06/business/17635644_1_mac-os-itools-apple-servers | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111102181558/http://articles.sfgate.com/2000-01-06/business/17635644_1_mac-os-itools-apple-servers | archivedate = November 2, 2011| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs quipped at the time that he would be using the title "iCEO".&lt;ref name="Jobs announces new MacOS, becomes 'iCEO'"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/01/05/macworld.keynote/index.html|title=Jobs announces new MacOS, becomes 'iCEO'|date=January 5, 2000|publisher=CNN|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820231820/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/01/05/macworld.keynote/index.html|archivedate=August 20, 2013|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company subsequently branched out, introducing and improving upon other digital appliances. With the introduction of the [[iPod]] portable music player, iTunes digital music software, and the [[iTunes Store]], the company made forays into consumer electronics and music distribution. On June 29, 2007, Apple entered the cellular phone business with the introduction of the [[iPhone]], a [[multi-touch]] display cell phone, which also included the features of an iPod and, with its own mobile browser, revolutionized the mobile browsing scene. While nurturing innovation, Jobs also reminded his employees that "real artists ship [deliver product]."&lt;ref name="Insanely Great"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Steven Levy|last=Levy|first=Steven|title=Insanely Great: The Life and Times of Macintosh, the Computer That Changed Everything|year=1995|publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=978-0-14-023237-0|page=312|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xqZQAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jobs had a public war of words with [[Dell, Inc.|Dell Computer]] CEO [[Michael Dell]], starting in 1987, when Jobs first criticized Dell for making "un-innovative beige boxes".&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10787_3-9940589-60.html |title=If Apple can go home again, why not Dell? |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62KufdsqH?url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10787_3-9940589-60.html |archivedate=October 10, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }} CNET News. May 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 6, 1997, at a [[Gartner]] Symposium, when Dell was asked what he would do if he ran the then-troubled Apple Computer company, he said: "I'd shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders."&lt;ref name="Dell: Apple should close shop"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com/Dell-Apple-should-close-shop/2100-1001_3-203937.html|publisher=[[CNET]]|title=Dell: Apple should close shop | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080517153618/http://www.news.com/Dell-Apple-should-close-shop/2100-1001_3-203937.html | archivedate = May 17, 2008| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 2006, Jobs sent an email to all employees when Apple's [[market capitalization]] rose above Dell's:

{{quote|Team, it turned out that Michael Dell wasn't perfect at predicting the future. Based on today's stock market close, Apple is worth more than Dell.

Jobs was both admired and criticized for his consummate skill at persuasion and salesmanship, which has been dubbed the "[[reality distortion field]]" and was particularly evident during his keynote speeches (colloquially known as "[[Stevenote]]s") at [[Macworld Conference &amp; Expo|Macworld Expos]] and at [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2012/10/04/11-presentation-lessons-you-can-still-learn-from-steve-jobs/ |title=11 Presentation Lessons You Can Still Learn From Steve Jobs |publisher=Forbes |date=May 28, 2014 |accessdate=June 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Jobs was granted stock options in the amount of 7.5&amp;nbsp;million shares of Apple with an exercise price of $18.30. It was alleged that the options had been [[backdating|backdated]], and that the exercise price should have been $21.10. It was further alleged that Jobs had thereby incurred taxable income of $20,000,000 that he did not report, and that Apple overstated its earnings by that same amount. As a result, Jobs potentially faced a number of criminal charges and civil penalties. The case was the subject of active criminal and civil government investigations,&lt;ref name="New questions raised about Steve Jobs's role in Apple stock options scandal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/finance/story.html?id=e23e0409-6b23-4176-83b6-b42012dd79fd&amp;k=88694|title=New questions raised about Steve Jobs's role in Apple stock options scandal|date=December 28, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509071812/http://www.canada.com/topics/finance/story.html?id=e23e0409-6b23-4176-83b6-b42012dd79fd&amp;k=88694 |archivedate=May 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; though an independent internal Apple investigation completed on December 29, 2006 found that Jobs was unaware of these issues and that the options granted to him were returned without being exercised in 2003.&lt;ref name="Apple restates, acknowledges faked documents"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=196800077|title=Apple restates, acknowledges faked documents|accessdate=January 1, 2007|date=December 29, 2006|work=[[EE Times]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130521222121/http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=196800077 | archivedate = May 21, 2013| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Jobs responded to criticism of Apple's poor recycling programs for [[e-waste]] in the US by lashing out at environmental and other advocates at Apple's annual meeting in Cupertino in April. A few weeks later, Apple announced it would take back iPods for free at its retail stores. The [[Computer recycling#Takeback|Computer TakeBack Campaign]] responded by flying a banner from a plane over the Stanford University graduation at which Jobs was the commencement speaker. The banner read "Steve, don't be a mini-playerrecycle all e-waste."

In 2006, he further expanded Apple's recycling programs to any US customer who buys a new Mac. This program includes shipping and "environmentally friendly disposal" of their old systems.&lt;ref name="Apple Improves Recycling Plan"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1952356,00.asp |title=Apple Improves Recycling Plan |date=April 21, 2006 |work=[[PC Magazine]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020063840/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0%2C1895%2C1952356%2C00.asp |archivedate=October 20, 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of Apple's unique products and services provided several years of stable financial returns, propelling Apple to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Bilton, {{cite news |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/09/apple-most-valuable-company/ |title=Apple Is the Most Valuable Company |work=The New York Times |first=Nick |last=Bilton |date=August 9, 2011}}, ''New York Times'', August 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 interview with biographer Walter Isaacson, Jobs revealed that he had met with US President [[Barack Obama]], complained about the nation's shortage of software engineers, and told Obama that he was "headed for a one-term presidency".&lt;ref name="obama"/&gt; Jobs proposed that any foreign student who got an engineering degree at a US university should automatically be offered a green card.

===Apple II===
{{Main article|Apple II}}
The Apple II is an [[8-bit]] [[home computer]], one of the first highly successful mass-produced [[microcomputer]] products,&lt;ref name="Ars Technica 2005-12-15"/&gt; designed primarily by [[Steve Wozniak]] (Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple II's unusual case&lt;ref name="JobsBio1"/&gt;{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}} and [[Rod Holt]] developed the unique power supply&lt;ref name="wozorg"/&gt;). It was introduced in 1977 at the [[West Coast Computer Faire]] by Jobs and was the first consumer product sold by [[Apple Computer]].

===Apple Lisa===
{{Main article|Apple Lisa}}
The Lisa is a personal computer designed by [[Apple Computer, Inc.]] during the early 1980s. It was the first personal computer to offer a [[graphical user interface]] in a machine aimed at individual business users. Development of the Lisa began in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christoph Dernbach |url=http://www.mac-history.net/apple-lisa/2007-10-12/apple-lisa |title=Apple Lisa |publisher=Mac History |date=October 12, 2007 |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lisa sold poorly, with only 100,000 units sold.&lt;ref&gt;Apple Lisa computer, http://oldcomputers.net/lisa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, after Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |titlelink=iCon: Steve Jobs |page = 70 |last1=Simon|first1=Jeffrey S. |last2=Young |first2=William L. |title=iCon: Steve Jobs, the greatest second act in the history of business| publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] |location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0471787846 |edition=Newly updated|accessdate=January 6, 2014|date=April 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; he joined the [[Macintosh]] project. The Macintosh is not a direct descendant of Lisa, although there are obvious similarities between the systems. The final revision, the Lisa 2/10, was modified and sold as the [[Macintosh XL]].&lt;ref name="apple_conf_v2_pg79"&gt;{{cite book|last=Linzmayer|first=Owen W.|title=Apple confidential 2.0 : the definitive history of the world's most colorful company|year=2004|publisher=[[No Starch Press]] (retrieved via Google Books)|location=San Francisco, Calif.|isbn=978-1593270100|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXnw5tM8QRwC&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=2nd|accessdate=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Macintosh===
{{Main article|Macintosh}}
Once he joined the [[Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh]] team, Jobs took over the project after Wozniak had experienced a traumatic airplane accident and temporarily left the company.&lt;ref name=TheVerge&gt;{{cite web|title=Steve Wozniak on Newton, Tesla, and why the original Macintosh was a 'lousy' product|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/27/4468314/steve-wozniak-on-how-the-newton-changed-his-life|accessdate=June 28, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312014832/http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/27/4468314/steve-wozniak-on-how-the-newton-changed-his-life|archivedate=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs introduced the Macintosh computer on January 24, 1984. This was the first mass-market personal computer featuring an integral [[graphical user interface]] and [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Polsson|first=Ken|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/applehis/appl1984.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821105822/http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/applehis/appl1984.htm|archivedate=August 21, 2009|title=Chronology of Apple Computer Personal Computers|date=July 29, 2009|accessdate=August 27, 2009}} See May 3, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; This first model was later renamed to "Macintosh 128k" for uniqueness amongst a populous family of subsequently updated models which are also based on Apple's same proprietary architecture. Since 1998, Apple has largely phased out the Macintosh name in favor of "Mac", though the product family has been nicknamed "Mac" or "the Mac" since the development of the first model. The Macintosh was introduced by a US$1.5&amp;nbsp;million [[Ridley Scott]] television commercial, "[[1984 (advertisement)|1984]]".&lt;ref name="appleconfidential2"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Linzmayer|first=Owen W.|title=Apple Confidential 2.0|publisher=No Starch Press|year=2004|page=113|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Iyb4f_GMLWI3fgg2nPaAIsVtyWI9FA-UR5Nw-yqOLE/edit?usp=sharing|isbn=1-59327-010-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It most notably aired during the third quarter of [[Super Bowl XVIII]] on January 22, 1984, and some people consider the ad a "watershed event"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Iyb4f_GMLWI3fgg2nPaAIsVtyWI9FA-UR5Nw-yqOLE/edit?usp=sharing|title=Apple's '1984' Super Bowl commercial still stands as watershed event|accessdate=April 11, 2010|last=Maney|first=Kevin|date=January 28, 2004|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "masterpiece."&lt;ref name="masterpiece"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Iyb4f_GMLWI3fgg2nPaAIsVtyWI9FA-UR5Nw-yqOLE/edit?usp=sharing|title=Why 2006 isn't like '1984'|accessdate=May 10, 2008|last=Leopold|first=Todd|date=February 3, 2006|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Regis McKenna]] called the ad "more successful than the Mac itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last =Creamer |first =Matthew |title =Apple's First Marketing Guru on Why '1984' Is Overrated |publisher =[[Ad Age]] |date =March 1, 2012 |url =http://adage.com/article/digital/apple-s-marketing-guru-1984-overrated/232933/ |accessdate = April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "1984" used an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by a [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]-style picture of the computer on her white [[sleeveless shirt|tank top]]) as a means of saving humanity from the "conformity" of IBM's attempts to dominate the computer industry. The ad [[allusion|alludes]] to [[George Orwell]]'s novel, ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', which described a [[dystopia|dystopian future]] ruled by a televised "[[Big Brother (1984)|Big Brother]]."&lt;ref name="cellini"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb197/is_200401/ai_n5556112 |title=The Story Behind Apple's '1984' TV commercial: Big Brother at 20 |accessdate=May 9, 2008 |last=Cellini |first=Adelia |date=January 2004 |work=[[MacWorld]] |issue=21 |volume=1 |page=18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090628133757/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb197/is_200401/ai_n5556112 |archivedate=June 28, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/01/72496|title=Jan. 22, 1984: Dawn of the Mac|accessdate=April 11, 2010|last=Long|first=Tony|date=January 22, 2007|publisher=[[Wired News|Wired]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Macintosh, however, was expensive, which hindered its ability to be competitive in a market already dominated by the [[Commodore 64]] for consumers, as well as the [[IBM Personal Computer]] and its accompanying [[IBM PC compatible|clone]] market for businesses.&lt;ref name="arstech"&gt;{{cite web | last = Reimer | first = Jeremy | title =Total share: 30 years of personal computer market share figures | website =[[Ars Technica]] | date = December 14, 2005 | url =https://arstechnica.com/features/2005/12/total-share/5/ | accessdate = April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macintosh systems still found success in education and desktop publishing and kept Apple as the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade.

===NeXT Computer===
{{Main article|NeXT Computer}}
After Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985, he started a company that built workstation computers. The [[NeXT Computer]] was introduced in 1988 at a [[NeXT Introduction|lavish launch event]]. [[Tim Berners-Lee]] created the world's first [[web browser]] ([[WorldWideWeb]]) using the NeXT Computer. The NeXT Computer was the basis for today's [[macOS]] (formerly OS X) and [[iOS]] (formerly iPhone OS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mia |title=Steve Jobs: 10 Products that Define this Tech Legend |url=http://inventionsdiscoveries.com/2011/08/steve-jobs-10-products-that-defines-this-tech-legend/ |work=Inventions and Discoveries |last=Carter |accessdate=March 27, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66fvK3UfN?url=http://inventionsdiscoveries.com/2011/08/steve-jobs-10-products-that-defines-this-tech-legend/ |archivedate=April 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NeXT"&gt;{{cite web|title=Steve Jobs Introduces NeXTComputer |url=http://www.computerhistory.org/tdih/October/12/ |accessdate=April 7, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FhunILqJ?url=http://www.computerhistory.org/tdih/October/12/ |archivedate=April 7, 2013 |quote=Steve Jobs unveiled the NeXT, the computer he designed after moving on from Apple Computer Inc... |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===iMac===
{{Main article|iMac}}
Apple [[iMac]] was introduced in 1998 and its innovative design was directly the result of Jobs's return to Apple. Apple boasted "the back of our computer looks better than the front of anyone else's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoppel|first=Adrian|title=Magical Inventions of Steve Jobs|url=http://www.maclife.com/article/gallery/14_best_inventions_steve_jobs#slide-1|work=Best Inventions of Steve Jobs|publisher=Magical Inventions of Steve Jobs|accessdate=March 27, 2012 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140410023029/http://www.maclife.com/article/gallery/14_best_inventions_steve_jobs | archivedate = April 10, 2014| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as "cartoonlike", the first iMac, clad in Bondi Blue plastic, was unlike any personal computer that came before. In 1999, Apple introduced the Graphite gray Apple iMac and since has varied the shape, colour and size considerably while maintaining the all-in-one design. Design ideas were intended to create a connection with the user such as the handle and a breathing light effect when the computer went to sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paola Antonelli|first=Paola|title=iMac  1998|url=http://www.metropolismag.com/story/20060320/imac-1998|publisher=MetropolisMag|accessdate=March 28, 2012 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130511085659/http://www.metropolismag.com/story/20060320/imac-1998 | archivedate = May 11, 2013| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Apple iMac sold for $1299 at that time. The iMac also featured some technical innovations, such as having USB ports as the only device inputs. This latter change resulted, through the iMac's success, in the interface being popularised among third party peripheral makersas evidenced by the fact that many early USB peripherals were made of translucent plastic (to match the iMac design).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael |title=Apple History: Evolution of the iMac |url=http://www.applegazette.com/imac/apple-history-evolution-of-the-imac/ |work=Apple Gazette |publisher=Apple Gazette |accessdate=March 28, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68ebTSDay?url=http://www.applegazette.com/imac/apple-history-evolution-of-the-imac/ |archivedate=June 24, 2012 |deadurl=no |date=August 7, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===iTunes===
{{Main article|iTunes}}
iTunes is a [[media player (application software)|media player]], media library, online radio broadcaster, and mobile device management application developed by Apple Inc. It is used to play, download, and organize digital [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] and video (as well as other types of media available on the iTunes Store) on personal computers running the [[macOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems. The [[iTunes Store]] is also available on the [[iPod Touch]], [[iPhone]], and [[iPad]].

Through the iTunes Store, users can purchase and download music, music videos, television shows, [[audiobook]]s, [[podcast]]s, movies, and movie rentals in some countries, and [[ringtone]]s, available on the iPhone and iPod Touch (fourth generation onward). [[Application software]] for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch can be downloaded from the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]].

===iPod===
{{Main article|iPod}}
The first generation of [[iPod]] was released October 23, 2001. The major innovation of the iPod was its small size achieved by using a 1.8" hard drive compared to the 2.5" drives common to players at that time. The capacity of the first generation iPod ranged from 5&amp;nbsp;GB to 10&amp;nbsp;GB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=iPod First Generation |url=http://www.ipodhistory.com/ipod-first-generation/ |work=iPod History |publisher=iPod History |accessdate=March 28, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68ebUpZdh?url=http://www.ipodhistory.com/ipod-first-generation/ |archivedate=June 24, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The iPod sold for US$399 and more than 100,000 iPods were sold before the end of 2001.
