'''Louis Pasteur''' ({{IPAc-en||l|u|i|_|p|||s|t|r}}, {{IPA-fr|lwi past|lang}}; December 27, 1822  September 28, 1895) was a [[French people|French]] [[biologist]], [[microbiologist]] and [[chemist]] renowned for his discoveries of the principles of [[vaccination]], [[fermentation|microbial fermentation]] and [[pasteurization]]. He is remembered for his remarkable breakthroughs in the causes and prevention of [[diseases]], and his discoveries have saved many lives ever since. He reduced mortality from [[puerperal fever]], and created the first vaccines for [[rabies]] and [[anthrax]]. His medical discoveries provided direct support for the [[germ theory of disease]] and its application in clinical medicine. He is best known to the general public for his invention of the technique of treating [[milk]] and [[wine]] to stop bacterial contamination, a process now called [[pasteurization]]. He is regarded as one of the three main founders of [[bacteriology]], together with [[Ferdinand Cohn]] and [[Robert Koch]], and is popularly known as the "father of microbiology".&lt;ref name="catholic intro"&gt;{{CathEncy| wstitle =Louis Pasteur| author = James J.

Pasteur was responsible for disproving the doctrine of [[spontaneous generation]]. He performed experiments that showed that without contamination, microorganisms could not develop. Under the auspices of the [[French Academy of Sciences]], he demonstrated that in sterilized and sealed flasks nothing ever developed, and in sterilized but open flasks microorganisms could grow.&lt;ref name=seckbach&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seckbach |first1=Joseph (editor)|title=Origins: Genesis, Evolution and Diversity of Life|year=2004|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Dordrecht, The Netherlands|isbn=978-1-4020-1813-8|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=937NljkEbgYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Pasteur was not the first to propose the [[germ theory]], his experiments indicated its correctness and convinced most of Europe that it was true. Today, he is often regarded as one of the fathers of germ theory.&lt;ref name="ullmann"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Ullmann| first = Agnes| title = Pasteur-Koch: Distinctive Ways of Thinking about Infectious Diseases| journal = Microbe | volume = 2| issue = 8| pages = 3837| date = August 2007| url = http://www.asm.org/index.php/component/content/article/114-unknown/unknown/4469-pasteur-koch-distinctive-ways-of-thinking-about-infectious-diseases| accessdate = December 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasteur made significant [[#Molecular asymmetry|discoveries]] in chemistry, most notably on the molecular basis for the [[asymmetry]] of certain [[crystals]] and [[racemization]]. Early in his career, his investigation of [[tartaric acid]] resulted in the first resolution of what is now called [[Chirality (chemistry)|optical isomers]]. His work led the way to the current understanding of a fundamental principle in the structure of organic compounds.

He was the director of the [[Pasteur Institute]], established in 1887, until his death, and his body was interred in a vault beneath the institute. Although Pasteur made groundbreaking experiments, his reputation became associated with various controversies. Historical reassessment of his notebook revealed that he practiced deception to overcome his rivals.&lt;ref name=Geison1995&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geison|first1=Gerald L|title=The Private Science of Louis Pasteur|year=1995|publisher=Princeton university press|location=Princeton (N.J.)|isbn=0-691-01552-X|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5670.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=C.|title=Pasteur Notebooks Reveal Deception|journal=Science|year=1993|volume=259|issue=5098|page=1117|doi=10.1126/science.259.5098.1117-a|pmid=8438162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and early life==
[[File:Louis Pasteur Geburtshaus in Dole.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The house in which Pasteur was born, [[Dole, Jura|Dole]]]]
Louis Pasteur was born on December 27, 1822, in [[Dole, Jura]], [[France]], to a [[Catholic]] family of a poor [[tanner (occupation)|tanner]].&lt;ref name="catholic intro"/&gt; He was the third child of Jean-Joseph Pasteur and Jeanne-Etiennette Roqui. The family moved to [[Marnoz]] in 1826 and then to [[Arbois]] in 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Debr|first1=Patrice|translator-last=Forster|translator-first=Elborg|title=Louis Pasteur|date=2000|publisher=JHU Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=9780801865299|pages=67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzOcl-FLw30C&amp;pg=PA6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robbins|first1=Louise|title=Louis Pasteur and the Hidden World of Microbes|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780195122275|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qUHuafXKKBEC&amp;pg=PA14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasteur entered primary school in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Debr|first1=Patrice|translator-last=Forster|translator-first=Elborg|title=Louis Pasteur|date=2000|publisher=JHU Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=9780801865299|pages=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzOcl-FLw30C&amp;pg=PA8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an average student in his early years, and not particularly academic, as his interests were [[fishing]] and [[sketch (drawing)|sketch]]ing.&lt;ref name="catholic intro"/&gt; He drew many pastels and portraits of his parents, friends and neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Debr|first1=Patrice|translator-last=Forster|translator-first=Elborg|title=Louis Pasteur|date=2000|publisher=JHU Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=9780801865299|pages=1213|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzOcl-FLw30C&amp;pg=PA12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasteur attended secondary school at the Collge d'Arbois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robbins|first1=Louise|title=Louis Pasteur and the Hidden World of Microbes|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780195122275|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qUHuafXKKBEC&amp;pg=PA15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1838, he left for Paris to join the Pension Barbet, but became homesick and returned in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Debr|first1=Patrice|translator-last=Forster|translator-first=Elborg|title=Louis Pasteur|date=2000|publisher=JHU Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=9780801865299|pages=1112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzOcl-FLw30C&amp;pg=PA11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1839, he entered the Collge Royal at [[Besanon]] to study philosophy and earned his Bachelor of Letters degree in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keim|first1=Albert|last2=Lumet|first2=Louis|title=Louis Pasteur|date=1914|publisher=Frederick A.

He managed to pass the ''baccalaurat scientifique'' (general science) degree in 1842 from Dijon but with a mediocre grade in chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Debr|first1=Patrice|translator-last=Forster|translator-first=Elborg|title=Louis Pasteur|date=2000|publisher=JHU Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=9780801865299|pages=1920|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzOcl-FLw30C&amp;pg=PA19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1842, Pasteur took the entrance test for the [[cole Normale Suprieure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robbins|first1=Louise|title=Louis Pasteur and the Hidden World of Microbes|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780195122275|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qUHuafXKKBEC&amp;pg=PA18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He passed the first set of tests, but because his ranking was low, Pasteur decided not to continue and try again next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Debr|first1=Patrice|translator-last=Forster|translator-first=Elborg|title=Louis Pasteur|date=2000|publisher=JHU Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=9780801865299|pages=2021|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzOcl-FLw30C&amp;pg=PA20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went back to the Pension Barbet to prepare for the test.

After serving briefly as professor of physics at the Dijon [[Lyce]] in 1848, he became professor of chemistry at the [[University of Strasbourg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keim|first1=Albert|last2=Lumet|first2=Louis|title=Louis Pasteur|date=1914|publisher=Frederick A.

==Career==
[[Image:Louis Pasteur en 1857.jpg|alt=Louis Pasteur in 1857|thumb|right|Pasteur in 1857]]
Pasteur was appointed professor of chemistry at the University of Strasbourg in 1848, and became the chair of chemistry in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Debr|first1=Patrice|translator-last=Forster|translator-first=Elborg|title=Louis Pasteur|date=2000|publisher=JHU Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=9780801865299|pages=502503}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854, he was named dean of the new faculty of sciences at [[Universit Lille Nord de France|Lille University]], where he began his studies on fermentation.&lt;ref name=Chirality/&gt; It was on this occasion that Pasteur uttered his oft-quoted remark: "''dans les champs de l'observation, le hasard ne favorise que les esprits prpars''" ("In the field of observation, chance favors only the prepared mind").&lt;ref&gt;L. Pasteur, "Discours prononc  Douai, le 7 dcembre 1854,  l'occasion de l'installation solennelle de la Facult des lettres de Douai et de la Facult des sciences de Lille" (Speech delivered at Douai on December 7, 1854 on the occasion of his formal inauguration to the Faculty of Letters of Douai and the Faculty of Sciences of Lille), reprinted in: Pasteur Vallery-Radot, ed., ''Oeuvres de Pasteur'' (Paris, France: Masson and Co., 1939), vol. 7, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7363q/f137.chemindefer page 131].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857, he moved to Paris as the director of scientific studies at the [[cole Normale Suprieure]] where he took control from 1858 to 1867 and introduced a series of reforms to improve the standard of scientific work. The examinations became more rigid, which led to better results, greater competition, and increased prestige. Many of his decrees, however, were rigid and authoritarian, leading to two serious student revolts. During "the bean revolt" he decreed that a mutton stew, which students had refused to eat, would be served and eaten every Monday. On another occasion he threatened to expel any student caught smoking, and 73 of the 80 students in the school resigned.&lt;ref name=Debre&gt;{{cite book|last1=Debr|first1=Patrice|others= Translated by Elborg Forster|title=Louis Pasteur|year=2000|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=9780801865299|pages=119120|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzOcl-FLw30C&amp;pg=PA119|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1863, he was appointed professor of geology, physics, and chemistry at the [[cole nationale suprieure des Beaux-Arts]], a position he held until his resignation in 1867. In 1867, he became the chair of organic chemistry at the Sorbonne,&lt;ref name="Debr &amp; Patrice pp. 505-7"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Debr|first1=Patrice|translator-last=Forster|translator-first=Elborg|title=Louis Pasteur|date=2000|publisher=JHU Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=9780801865299|pages=505507}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he later gave up the position because of poor health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vallery-Radot|first1=Ren|translator-last=Devonshire|translator-first=R.

==Research==

===Molecular asymmetry===
[[Image:Pcrystals.svg|thumb|Pasteur separated the left and right [[crystal]] shapes from each other to form two piles of crystals: in solution one form rotated light to the left, the other to the right, while an [[Racemic mixture|equal mixture]] of the two forms canceled each other's effect, and does not rotate the [[polarized light]].]]

In Pasteur's early work as a [[chemist]], beginning at the ''cole Normale Suprieure'', and continuing at Strasbourg and Lille, he examined the chemical, optical and crystallographic properties of a group of compounds known as [[tartrates]].&lt;ref name="Flack"/&gt;

He resolved a problem concerning the nature of [[tartaric acid]] in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;L.

Pasteur noticed that crystals of tartrates had small faces. Then he observed that, in [[racemic mixture]]s of tartrates, half of the crystals were right-handed and half were left-handed. In solution, the right-handed compound was [[dextrorotatory]], and the left-handed one was levorotatory.&lt;ref name="Flack"/&gt; Pasteur determined that optical activity related to the shape of the crystals, and that an asymmetric internal arrangement of the molecules of the compound was responsible for twisting the light.&lt;ref name=Chirality&gt;{{cite web|title=Louis Pasteur|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/louis-pasteur|website=[[Science History Institute]]|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The (2R,3R)- and (2S,3S)- tartrates were isometric, non-superposable mirror images of each other. This was the first time anyone had demonstrated [[Chirality (chemistry)|molecular chirality]], and also the first explanation of [[isomer]]ism.&lt;ref name="Flack"/&gt;

Some historians consider Pasteur's work in this area to be his "most profound and most original contributions to science", and his "greatest scientific discovery."&lt;ref name="Flack"/&gt;

===Fermentation and germ theory of diseases===

Pasteur was motivated to investigate fermentation while working at Lille. In 1856 a local wine manufacturer, M. Bigot, whose son was one of Pasteur's students, sought for his advice on the problems of making beetroot alcohol and souring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vallery-Radot|first1=Ren|translator-last=Devonshire|translator-first=R.

According to his son-in-law, Ren Vallery-Radot, in August 1857 Pasteur sent a paper about lactic acid fermentation to the Socit des Sciences de Lille, but the paper was read three months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vallery-Radot|first1=Ren|title=La vie de Pasteur|date=1907|publisher=Librairie Hachette|location=Paris|page=98|url=https://archive.org/stream/laviedepasteur01vallgoog#page/n110/mode/2up|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memoire was subsequently published on November 30, 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pasteur|first1=Louis|title=Mmoire sur la fermentation appele lactique|journal=Comptes Rendus Chimie|year=1857|volume=45|pages=913916|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30026.image.r=+COMPTES+RENDUS+++DES+S%C3%89ANCES+DE+L.f915.langFR|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the memoir, he developed his ideas stating that: "I intend to establish that, just as there is an alcoholic ferment, the yeast of beer, which is found everywhere that sugar is decomposed into alcohol and carbonic acid, so also there is a particular ferment, a [[lactic acid bacteria|lactic yeast]], always present when [[Lactic acid fermentation|sugar becomes lactic acid]]."&lt;ref name=manchester2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manchester|first1=K.L.|title=Louis Pasteur, fermentation, and a rival|journal=South African Journal of Science|year=2007|volume=103|issue=910|pages=377380|url=http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S0038-23532007000500008&amp;script=sci_arttext}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasteur also wrote about alcoholic fermentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pasteur|first1=Louis|title=Mmoire sur la fermentation alcoolique|journal=Comptes Rendus Chimie|year=1857|volume=45|issue=6|pages=10321036|pmc=2229983|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in full form in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pasteur|first1=Louis|title=Nouveaux faits concernant l'histoire de la fermentation alcoolique|journal=Comptes Rendus Chimie|year=1858|volume=47|pages=10111013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pasteur|first1=Louis|title=Nouveaux faits concernant l'histoire de la fermentation alcoolique|journal=Annales de Chimie et de Physique |series=3rd Series|year=1858|volume=52|pages=404418|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jns Jacob Berzelius]] and [[Justus von Liebig]] had proposed the theory that fermentation was caused by decomposition.

Pasteur's research also showed that the growth of micro-organisms was responsible for spoiling beverages, such as beer, wine and milk. With this established, he invented a process in which liquids such as milk were heated to a temperature between 60 and 100&amp;nbsp;C.&lt;ref name=Bowden/&gt; This killed most bacteria and moulds already present within them. Pasteur and [[Claude Bernard]] completed tests on blood and urine on April 20, 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vallery-Radot|first1=Ren|translator-last=Devonshire|translator-first=R.

Beverage contamination led Pasteur to the idea that micro-organisms infecting animals and humans cause disease. He proposed preventing the entry of micro-organisms into the human body, leading [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] to develop [[antiseptic]] methods in surgery.&lt;ref name=Listerine&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hicks|first1=Jesse|title=A Fresh Breath|url=http://www.chemheritage.org/discover/online-resources/thanks-to-chemistry/listerine.aspx|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine |publisher=Chemical Heritage Foundation|accessdate=27 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611130657/http://www.chemheritage.org/discover/online-resources/thanks-to-chemistry/listerine.aspx|archivedate=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, Pasteur published ''Etudes sur le Vin'', about the diseases of wine, and he published ''Etudes sur la Bire'' in 1876, concerning the diseases of beer.&lt;ref name=Barnett /&gt;

In the early 19th century, [[Agostino Bassi]] had shown that [[muscardine]] was caused by a fungus that infected silkworms.&lt;ref name=Hatcher /&gt; Since 1853, two diseases called ''[[pbrine]]'' and ''[[flacherie]]'' had been infecting great numbers of [[silkworm]]s in southern France, and by 1865 they were causing huge losses to farmers. In 1865, Pasteur went to [[Als]] and worked for five years until 1870.&lt;ref name=Berche&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berche|first1=P.|title=Louis Pasteur, from crystals of life to vaccination|journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection|date=2012|volume=18|issue=s5|pages=16|doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03945.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03945.x/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schwartz /&gt;

Silkworms with pbrine were covered in corpuscles. In the first three years, Pasteur thought that the corpuscles were a symptom of the disease. In 1870, he concluded that the corpuscles were the cause of pbrine (it is now known that the cause is a [[microsporidian]]).&lt;ref name=Hatcher&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hatcher|first1=Paul|last2=Battey|first2=Nick|title=Biological Diversity: Exploiters and Exploited|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-97986-0|pages=8889, 91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FpQpedSpeWMC&amp;pg=PA89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasteur also showed that the disease was hereditary.&lt;ref name="Keim pp. 87-88"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keim|first1=Albert|last2=Lumet|first2=Louis|title=Louis Pasteur|date=1914|publisher=Frederick A.

The pulp was examined with a microscope, and if corpuscles were observed, the eggs were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vallery-Radot|first1=Ren|translator-last=Devonshire|translator-first=R.

===Spontaneous generation===
[[File:Coldecygne.svg|thumb|Bottle en ''col de cygne'' ([[swan neck flask|swan-neck bottle]]) used by Pasteur]]
[[File:Louis Pasteur Experiment.svg|thumb|Louis Pasteurs pasteurization experiment illustrates the fact that the spoilage of liquid was caused by particles in the air rather than the air itself. These experiments were important pieces of evidence supporting the germ theory of disease.]]
Following his fermentation experiments, Pasteur demonstrated that the skin of grapes was the natural source of yeasts, and that sterilized grapes and grape juice never fermented. He drew grape juice from under the skin with sterilized needles, and also covered grapes with sterilized cloth. Both experiments could not produce wine in sterilized containers.&lt;ref name=Ligon /&gt;

His findings and ideas were against the prevailing notion of [[spontaneous generation]]. He received a particularly stern criticism from [[Flix Archimde Pouchet]], who was director of the [[Musum d'Histoire Naturelle de Rouen|Rouen Museum of Natural History]]. To settle the debate between the eminent scientists, the French Academy of Sciences offered the Alhumbert Prize carrying 2,500 [[francs]] to whoever could experimentally demonstrate for or against the doctrine.&lt;ref name=Magner&gt;{{cite book|last1=Magner|first1=Lois N.|title=History of the Life Sciences|year=2002|publisher=Marcel Dekker|location=New York|isbn=978-0-2039-1100-6|pages=251252|edition=3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC&amp;dq=Pasteur+spontaneous+generation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roll-Hansen|first1=Nils|title=Experimental Method and Spontaneous Generation: The Controversy between Pasteur and Pouchet, 185964|journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences|year=1979|volume=XXXIV|issue=3|pages=273292|doi=10.1093/jhmas/XXXIV.3.273|pmid=383780}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farley|first1=J|last2=Geison|first2=GL|title=Science, politics and spontaneous generation in nineteenth-century France: the Pasteur-Pouchet debate|journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine|year=1974|volume=48|issue=2|pages=16198|pmid=4617616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pouchet stated that air everywhere could cause spontaneous generation of living organisms in liquids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keim|first1=Albert|last2=Lumet|first2=Louis|title=Louis Pasteur|date=1914|publisher=Frederick A. Stokes Company|pages=64|url=https://archive.org/stream/louispasteur00keim#page/64/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1850s, he performed experiments and claimed that they were evidence of spontaneous generation.&lt;ref name="porter"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Magner /&gt; [[Francesco Redi]] and [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]] had provided some evidence against spontaneous generation in the 17th and 18th centuries, respectively. Spallanzani's experiments in 1765 suggested that air contaminated broths with bacteria. In the 1860s, Pasteur repeated Spallanzani's experiments, but Pouchet reported a different result using a different broth.&lt;ref name=Berche /&gt;

Pasteur performed several experiments to disprove spontaneous generation. He placed boiled liquid in a flask and let hot air enter the flask. Then he closed the flask, and no organisms grew in it.&lt;ref name="porter"/&gt; In another experiment, when he opened flasks containing boiled liquid, dust entered the flasks, causing organisms to grow in some of them. The number of flasks in which organisms grew was lower at higher altitudes, showing that air at high altitudes contained less dust and fewer organisms.&lt;ref name=Ligon /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vallery-Radot|first1=Ren|translator-last=Devonshire|translator-first=R. L.|title=The Life of Pasteur|date=1919|publisher=Constable &amp; Company|location=London|pages=9698|url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.173907/2015.173907.The-Life-Of-Pasteur#page/n117/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasteur also used [[swan neck flask]]s containing a fermentable liquid. Air was allowed to enter the flask via a long curving tube that made dust particles stick to it. Nothing grew in the broths unless the flasks were tilted, making the liquid touch the contaminated walls of the neck. This showed that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, on dust, rather than spontaneously generating within the liquid or from the action of pure air.&lt;ref name=Ligon /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keim|first1=Albert|last2=Lumet|first2=Louis|title=Louis Pasteur|date=1914|publisher=Frederick A. Stokes Company|pages=6367|url=https://archive.org/stream/louispasteur00keim#page/62/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These were some of the most important experiments disproving the theory of spontaneous generation, for which Pasteur won the Alhumbert Prize in 1862.&lt;ref name="porter"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Porter|first1=JR|title=Louis Pasteur: achievements and disappointments, 1861.|journal=Bacteriological Reviews|year=1961|volume=25|pages=389403|pmid=14037390|url=http://mmbr.asm.org/content/25/4/389.long|pmc=441122}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that:&lt;ref name=Ligon&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ligon|first1=B.

===Immunology and vaccination===
====Chicken cholera====
Pasteur's later work on diseases included work on [[chicken cholera]]. He received cultures from [[Jean Joseph Henri Toussaint]], and cultivated them in chicken broth.&lt;ref name="Plotkin pp. 35-36"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Plotkin|editor1-first=Stanley A.|title=History of Vaccine Development|date=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4419-1339-5|pages=3536|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wf2jS_4lCOAC&amp;pg=PA39}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this work, a culture of the responsible [[bacterium|bacteria]] had spoiled and failed to induce the disease in some [[chicken]]s he was infecting with the disease. Upon reusing these healthy chickens, Pasteur discovered he could not infect them, even with fresh bacteria; the weakened bacteria had caused the chickens to become [[immune]] to the disease, though they had caused only mild symptoms.&lt;ref name="catholic intro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ullmann"/&gt;

In 1879, his assistant, [[Charles Chamberland]] (of French origin), had been instructed to inoculate the chickens after Pasteur went on holiday. Chamberland failed to do this and went on holiday himself. On his return, the month-old cultures made the chickens unwell, but instead of the infections being fatal, as they usually were, the chickens recovered completely. Chamberland assumed an error had been made, and wanted to discard the apparently faulty culture, but Pasteur stopped him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Dixon|first=Bernard|title=The hundred years of Louis Pasteur|magazine=New Scientist|issue=1221|pages=3032|date=1980|publisher=Reed Business Information|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eOHNHA9ga84C&amp;pg=PA31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Sternberg| first = George M.| title = A Textbook of Bacteriology| publisher = William Wood and Company| year = 1901| location = New York| pages = 2789| url = https://books.google.com/?id=uNziSqWxtBwC&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278&amp;dq=pasteur+loir+anthrax&amp;q=pasteur%20loir%20anthrax}}&lt;/ref&gt; He inoculated the chickens with virulent bacteria that killed other chickens, and they survived. Pasteur concluded that the animals were now immune to the disease.&lt;ref name="Artenstein p. 75"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Artenstein|editor1-first=Andrew W.|title=Vaccines: A Biography|date=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4419-1108-7|page=75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ewdL8ilILZAC&amp;pg=PA75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1879, Pasteur used a weakened culture of the bacteria to inoculate chickens. The chickens survived, and when he inoculated them with a virulent strain, they were immune to it. In 1880, Pasteur presented his results to the French Academy of Sciences, saying that the bacteria were weakened by contact with oxygen.&lt;ref name="Plotkin pp. 35-36" /&gt;

====Anthrax====
In the 1870s, he applied this immunization method to [[anthrax]], which affected [[cattle]], and aroused interest in combating other diseases. Pasteur cultivated bacteria from the blood of animals infected with anthrax. When he inoculated animals with the bacteria, anthrax occurred, proving that the bacteria was the cause of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keim|first1=Albert|last2=Lumet|first2=Louis|title=Louis Pasteur|date=1914|publisher=Frederick A.

Pasteur thought that earthworms might have brought the bacteria to the surface.

[[File:Albert Edelfelt - Louis Pasteur - 1885.jpg|thumb|left|''Louis Pasteur in his laboratory'', painting by [[Albert Edelfelt|A. Edelfeldt]] in 1885]]

In 1880, Pasteur's rival [[Jean Joseph Henri Toussaint|Jean-Joseph-Henri Toussaint]], a [[veterinary surgeon]], used [[carbolic acid]] to kill anthrax bacilli and tested the vaccine on sheep. Pasteur thought that this type of killed vaccine should not work because he believed that attenuated bacteria used up nutrients that the bacteria needed to grow.

The notion of a weak form of a disease causing immunity to the virulent version was not new; this had been known for a long time for [[smallpox]].

In 1876, [[Robert Koch]] had shown that ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' caused anthrax.&lt;ref name="De Paolo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Paolo|first1=Charles|title=Epidemic Disease and Human Understanding: A Historical Analysis of Scientific and Other Writings|date=2006|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-786-42506-8|pages=103, 111114|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xcz7Y9qVGQMC&amp;pg=PA103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his papers published between 1878 and 1880, Pasteur only mentioned Koch's work in a footnote. Koch met Pasteur at the Seventh International Medical Congress in 1881. A few months later, Koch wrote that Pasteur had used impure cultures and made errors. In 1882, Pasteur replied to Koch in a speech, to which Koch responded aggressively.&lt;ref name="ullmann" /&gt; Koch stated that Pasteur tested his vaccine on unsuitable animals and that Pasteur's research was not properly scientific.&lt;ref name=Ligon /&gt; In 1882, Koch wrote "On the Anthrax Inoculation", in which he refuted several of Pasteur's conclusions about anthrax and criticized Pasteur for keeping his methods secret, jumping to conclusions, and being imprecise. In 1883, Pasteur wrote that he used cultures prepared in a similar way to his successful fermentation experiments and that Koch misinterpreted statistics and ignored Pasteur's work on silkworms.&lt;ref name="De Paolo" /&gt;

====Swine erysipelas====
In 1882, Pasteur sent his assistant [[Louis Thuillier]] to southern France because of an [[epizootic]] of [[swine erysipelas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Plotkin|editor1-first=Stanley A.|title=History of Vaccine Development|date=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4419-1339-5|page=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wf2jS_4lCOAC&amp;pg=PA39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thuillier identified the bacillus that caused the disease in March 1883.&lt;ref name=Berche /&gt; Pasteur and Thuillier increased the bacillus's virulence after passing it through pigeons. Then they passed the bacillus through rabbits, weakening it and obtaining a vaccine. Pasteur and Thuillier incorrectly described the bacterium as a figure-eight shape. Roux described the bacterium as stick-shaped in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bazin|first1=Herv|title=Vaccination: A History|date=2011|publisher=John Libbey Eurotext|isbn=978-2-7420-0775-2|page=211|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=orjaA_7sYZQC&amp;pg=PA211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Story of San Michele]]'', [[Axel Munthe]] writes of some risks Pasteur undertook in the rabies vaccine research:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Munthe|first1=Axel|title=The Story of San Michele|date=2010|origyear=First published 1929|publisher=Hachette UK|isbn=9781848545267|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XOfWJdqYoHYC&amp;printsec=frontcover|chapter=V: Patients}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Pasteur himself was absolutely fearless. Anxious to secure a sample of saliva straight from the jaws of a rabid dog, I once saw him with the glass tube held between his lips draw a few drops of the deadly saliva from the mouth of a rabid bull-dog, held on the table by two assistants, their hands protected by leather gloves.}}

Because of his study in germs, Pasteur encouraged doctors to sanitize their hands and equipment before surgery. Prior to this, few doctors or their assistants practiced these procedures.

==Controversies==

A French national hero at age 55, in 1878 Pasteur discreetly told his family never to reveal his laboratory notebooks to anyone. His family obeyed, and all his documents were held and inherited in secrecy. Finally, in 1964 Pasteur's grandson and last surviving male descendant, Pasteur Valley-Radot, donated the papers to the French national library ([[Bibliothque nationale de France]]). Yet the papers were restricted for historical studies until the death of Valley-Radot in 1971. The documents were given a catalogue number only in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geison|first1=Gerald L.|title=The Private Science of Louis Pasteur|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-400-86408-9|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books/p/princeton?id=tEkABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the centennial of the death of Louis Pasteur, a historian of science [[Gerald L. Geison]] published an analysis of Pasteur's private notebooks in his ''The Private Science of Louis Pasteur'', and declared that Pasteur had given several misleading accounts and played deceptions in his most important discoveries.&lt;ref name=Geison1995/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altman|first1=Lawrence K|title=Revisionist history sees Pasteur as liar who stole rival's ideas|journal=The New York Times on the Web|year=1995|volume=16|pages=C1, C3|pmid=11647062|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/16/science/doctor-s-world-revisionist-history-sees-pasteur-liar-who-stole-rival-s-ideas.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Perutz]] published a defense of Pasteur in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dec. 21, 1995 NY Review of Books [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1995/dec/21/the-pioneer-defended/], letters [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1996/apr/04/pasteur-and-the-culture-wars-an-exchange/] [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1997/feb/06/pasteurs-private-science/]&lt;/ref&gt; Based on further examinations of Pasteur's documents, French immunologist Patrice Debr concluded in his book'' Louis Pasteur'' (1998) that in spite of his genius, Pasteur had some faults. A book review states that Debr "sometimes finds him unfair, combative, arrogant, unattractive in attitude, inflexible and even dogmatic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Debr|first1=Patrice|title=Louis Pasteur|year=2000|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0-8018-6529-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kauffman|first1=George B|title=Book Review: Louis, Louis, Louis|journal=American Scientist|year=1999|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/louis-louis-louis|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fermentation===

Scientists before Pasteur had studied fermentation. In the 1830s, [[Charles Cagniard-Latour]], [[Friedrich Traugott Ktzing]] and [[Theodor Schwann]] used microscopes to study yeasts and concluded that yeasts were living organisms. In 1839, [[Justus von Liebig]], [[Friedrich Whler]] and [[Jns Jacob Berzelius]] stated that yeast was not an organism and was produced when air acted on plant juice.&lt;ref name=Barnett /&gt;

In 1855, [[Antoine Bchamp]], Professor of Chemistry at the [[University of Montpellier]], conducted experiments with sucrose solutions and concluded that water was the factor for fermentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bchamp|first1=A|title=Note sur l'influence que l'eau pure et certaines dissolutions salines exercent sur le sucre de canne|journal=Comptes Rendus Chimie|year=1855|volume=40|pages=436438}}&lt;/ref&gt; He changed his conclusion in 1858, stating that fermentation was directly related to the growth of moulds, which required air for growth. He regarded himself as the first to show the role of microorganisms in fermentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bchamp|first1=A|title=De l'influence que l'eau pur ou charge de diverse sels exerce  froid sur the sucre de canne|journal=Comptes Rendus Chimie|year=1858|volume=46|pages=447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=manchester2007 /&gt;

Pasteur started his experiments in 1857 and published his findings in 1858 (April issue of ''Comptes Rendus Chimie'', Bchamp's paper appeared in January issue). Bchamp noted that Pasteur did not bring any novel idea or experiments. On the other hand, Bchamp was probably aware of Pasteur's 1857 preliminary works. With both scientists claiming priority on the discovery, a dispute, extending to several areas, lasted throughout their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cadeddu|first1=A|title=The heuristic function of 'error' in the scientific methodology of Louis Pasteur: the case of the silkworm diseases|journal=History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences|year=2000|volume=22|issue=1|pages=328|pmid=11258099}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="manchester-2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Manchester KL |title=Antoine B&amp;eacute;champ: pere de la biologie.

However, Bchamp was on the losing side, as the ''[[BMJ]]'' obituary remarked: His name was "associated with bygone controversies as to priority which it would be unprofitable to recall".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Anonymous|title=Obituary: Professor Bechamp|journal=The British Medical Journal|year=1908|volume=1|issue=2471|page=1150|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.2471.1150-b|pmc=2436492}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bchamp proposed the incorrect theory of [[microzyme]]s. According to K. L. Manchester, [[anti-vivisectionist]]s and proponents of [[alternative medicine]] promoted Bchamp and microzymes, unjustifiably claiming that Pasteur plagiarized Bchamp.&lt;ref name=manchester2007 /&gt;

Pasteur thought that [[succinic acid]] inverted sucrose. In 1860, [[Marcellin Berthelot]] isolated [[invertase]] and showed that succinic acid did not invert sucrose.&lt;ref name=Barnett /&gt; Pasteur believed that fermentation was only due to living cells. [[Hans Ernst August Buchner|Hans Buchner]] discovered that [[zymase]] catalyzed fermentation, showing that fermentation was catalyzed by enzymes within cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Windelspecht|first1=Michael|title=Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries of the 19th Century|year=2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Westport|isbn=9780313319693|page=100|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hX1jPbJVSu4C&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eduard Buchner]] also discovered that fermentation could take place outside living cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Dworkin|editor1-first=Martin|editor2-last=Falkow|editor2-first=Stanley|editor3-last=Rosenberg|editor3-first=Eugene|editor4-last=Schleifer|editor4-first=Karl-Heinz|editor5-last=Stackebrandt|editor5-first=Erko|title=The Prokaryotes: Vol. 1: Symbiotic Associations, Biotechnology, Applied Microbiology|date=2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-3872-5476-0|pages=285286|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hqh43LFTGBQC&amp;pg=PA285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthrax vaccine===

Pasteur publicly claimed his success in developing the anthrax vaccine in 1881.&lt;ref name=trueman/&gt; However, his admirer-turned-rival Toussaint was the one who developed the first vaccine. Toussaint isolated the bacteria that caused chicken cholera (later named ''[[Pasteurella]]'' in honour of Pasteur) in 1879 and gave samples to Pasteur who used them for his own works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swabe|first1=Joanna|title=Animals, Disease and Human Society: Human-animal Relations and the Rise of Veterinary Medicine|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-67540-1|page=83|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4WWGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 12, 1880, Toussaint presented his successful result to the French Academy of Sciences, using an attenuated vaccine against anthrax in dogs and sheep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Susan D.|title=Death in a Small Package: A Short History of Anthrax|year=2010|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-1-4214-0252-9|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mK72X-XkIKgC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasteur on grounds of jealousy contested the discovery by publicly displaying his vaccination method at Pouilly-le-Fort on 5 May 1881.&lt;ref name=Chevallier-Jussiau /&gt; Pasteur gave a misleading account of the preparation of the anthrax vaccine used in the experiment at Pouilly-le-Fort.

===Experimental ethics===

Pasteur experiments are often cited as against [[medical ethics]], especially on his vaccination of Meister. He did not have any experience in medical practice, and more importantly, a [[medical license]]. This is often cited as a serious threat to his professional and personal reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geison|first1=Gerald L.|title=Pasteur, Roux, and Rabies: Scientific Clinical Mentalities|journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences|year=1990|volume=45|issue=3|pages=341365|doi=10.1093/jhmas/45.3.341|pmid=2212608}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forster|first1=Patrice Debr ; translated by Elborg|title=Louis Pasteur|year=2000|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0-8018-6529-9|pages=455456|edition=Johns Hopkins pbk.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzOcl-FLw30C&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; His closest partner [[mile Roux]], who had medical qualifications, refused to participate in the [[clinical trial]], likely because he considered it unjust.&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Jackson|editor-first=Alan C.|title=Rabies: Scientific Basis of the Disease and Its Management|year=2013|publisher=Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-12-397230-9|pages=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e1UFMYVHCboC&amp;pg=PA3|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pasteur executed vaccination of the boy under the close watch of practising physicians [[Jacques-Joseph Grancher]], head of the Paris Children's Hospital's paediatric clinic, and [[Alfred Vulpian]], a member of the Commission on Rabies.

{{main|List of things named after Louis Pasteur}}

In many localities worldwide, streets are named in his honor. For example, in the USA: [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] and [[Irvine, California]], Boston and Polk, Florida, adjacent to the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio]]; Jonquire, Qubec; San Salvador de Jujuy and Buenos Aires ([[Argentina]]), [[Great Yarmouth]] in Norfolk, in the United Kingdom, Jericho and Wulguru in Queensland, (Australia); [[Phnom Penh]] in [[Cambodia]]; [[Ho Chi Minh City]]; Batna in [[Algeria]]; [[Bandung]] in [[Indonesia]], [[Tehran]] in [[Iran]], near the central campus of the [[Warsaw University]] in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]; adjacent to the Odessa State Medical University in [[Odessa]], [[Ukraine]]; [[Milan]] in Italy and [[Bucharest]], [[Cluj-Napoca]] and [[Timioara]] in [[Romania]]. The Avenue Pasteur in Saigon, Vietnam, is one of the few streets in that city to retain its French name. ''Avenue Louis Pasteur'' in the [[Longwood Medical and Academic Area]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] was named in his honor in the French manner with "Avenue" preceding the name of the dedicatee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pasteurfoundation.org/MAHarvardAvePasteur.shtml Pasteur Foundation, Pasteur Memorials USA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014093352/http://www.pasteurfoundation.org/MAHarvardAvePasteur.shtml |date=October 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Institute Pasteur and [[Universit Louis Pasteur]] were named after Pasteur. The schools [[Lyce Pasteur (Neuilly-sur-Seine)|Lyce Pasteur]] in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], France, and [[Lyce Louis Pasteur (Calgary)|Lyce Louis Pasteur]] in [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]], [[Canada]], are named after him. In South Africa, the Louis Pasteur Private Hospital in [[Pretoria]], and Life Louis Pasteur Private Hospital, [[Bloemfontein]], are named after him. Louis Pasteur University Hospital in [[Koice]], [[Slovakia]] is also named after Pasteur.

A statue of Pasteur is erected at [[San Rafael High School]] in [[San Rafael, California]]. A bronze bust of him resides on the French Campus of [[Kaiser Permanente]]'s San Francisco Medical Center in [[San Francisco]]. The sculpture was designed by Harriet G. Moore and cast in 1984 by Artworks Foundry.&lt;ref name=SOS&gt;{{cite web|title=Louis Pasteur, (sculpture)|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!310287~!0#focus|work=Save Outdoor Sculpture!|publisher=[[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]|accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UNESCO/Institut Pasteur Medal]] was created on the centenary of Pasteur's death, and is given every two years in his name, "in recognition of outstanding research contributing to a beneficial impact on human health".&lt;ref name="unesco-2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=26770&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Louis Pasteur (1822-1895)|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pasteur Institute===
{{main|Pasteur Institute}}
After developing the rabies vaccine, Pasteur proposed an institute for the vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vallery-Radot|first1=Ren|translator-last=Devonshire|translator-first=R. L.|title=The Life of Pasteur|date=1919|publisher=Constable &amp; Company|location=London|page=428|url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.173907/2015.173907.The-Life-Of-Pasteur#page/n447/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887, fundraising for the Pasteur Institute began, with donations from many countries. The official statute was registered in 1887, stating that the institute's purposes were "the treatment of rabies according to the method developed by M. Pasteur" and "the study of virulent and contagious diseases".&lt;ref name=Wasik /&gt; The institute was inaugurated on November 14, 1888.&lt;ref name=Wasik /&gt; He brought together scientists with various specialties. The first five departments were directed by two graduates of the ''[[cole Normale Suprieure]]'': [[mile Duclaux]] (general [[microbiology]] research) and [[Charles Chamberland]] (microbe research applied to [[hygiene]]), as well as a biologist, [[lie Metchnikoff]] (morphological microbe research) and two [[physician]]s, [[Jacques-Joseph Grancher]] ([[rabies]]) and [[mile Roux]] (technical microbe research). One year after the inauguration of the institute, Roux set up the first course of microbiology ever taught in the world, then entitled ''Cours de Microbie Technique'' (Course of microbe research techniques). Since 1891 the Pasteur Institute had been extended to different countries, and currently there are 32 institutes in 29 countries in various parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= |title= Institut Pasteur International Network| url= http://www.pasteur-international.org/ip/easysite/pasteur-international-en/institut-pasteur-international-network/the-network |work= pasteur-international.org |publisher= |accessdate= 2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

===Faith and spirituality===
His grandson, [[Louis Pasteur Vallery-Radot]], wrote that Pasteur had kept from his Catholic background only a spiritualism without religious practice.&lt;ref&gt;Pasteur Vallery-Radot, Letter to Paul Dupuy, 1939, quoted by Hilaire Cuny, ''Pasteur et le mystre de la vie'', Paris, Seghers, 1963, p. 5354. Patrice Pinet, ''Pasteur et la philosophie'', Paris, 2005, p. 134135, quotes analogous assertions of Pasteur Vallery-Radot, with references to Pasteur Vallery-Radot, ''Pasteur inconnu'', p. 232, and Andr George, ''Pasteur'', Paris, 1958, p. 187. According to Maurice Vallery-Radot (''Pasteur'', 1994, p. 378), the false quotation appeared for the first time in the ''Semaine religieuse&amp;nbsp;... du diocse de Versailles'', October 6, 1895, p. 153, shortly after the death of Pasteur.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Catholic observers often said that Pasteur remained an ardent [[Christian]] throughout his whole life, and his son-in-law wrote, in a biography of him:
{{quote|Absolute faith in God and in Eternity, and a conviction that the power for good given to us in this world will be continued beyond it, were feelings which pervaded his whole life; the virtues of the gospel had ever been present to him. Full of respect for the form of religion which had been that of his forefathers, he came simply to it and naturally for spiritual help in these last weeks of his life.&lt;ref&gt;(Vallery-Radot 1911, vol. 2, p. 240)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Maurice Vallery-Radot, grandson of the brother of the son-in-law of Pasteur and outspoken Catholic, also holds that Pasteur fundamentally remained Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Vallery-Radot| first = Maurice | title = Pasteur| publisher = Perrin| year = 1994| location = Paris| pages = 377407}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to both Pasteur Vallery-Radot and Maurice Vallery-Radot, the following well-known [[quotation]] attributed to Pasteur is apocryphal:&lt;ref&gt;Pasteur Vallery-Radot, Letter to Paul Dupuy, 1939, quoted by Hilaire Cuny, ''Pasteur et le mystre de la vie'', Paris, Seghers, 1963, p. 5354.&lt;/ref&gt; "The more I know, the more nearly is my faith that of the Breton peasant. Could I but know all I would have the faith of a Breton peasant's wife".&lt;ref name="catholic intro"/&gt; According to Maurice Vallery-Radot,&lt;ref&gt;''Pasteur'', 1994, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; the false quotation appeared for the first time shortly after the death of Pasteur.&lt;ref&gt;In Pasteur's ''Semaine religieuse&amp;nbsp;... du diocse de Versailles'', October 6, 1895, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite his belief in God, it has been said that his views were that of a freethinker rather than a Catholic, a spiritual more than a religious man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Biographical Dictionary of Ancient, Medieval, and Modern Freethinkers|year=1945|publisher=Haldeman-Julius Publications|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/joseph_mccabe/dictionary.html|author=Joseph McCabe|accessdate=11 August 2012|quote=The anonymous Catholic author quotes as his authority the standard biography by Vallery-Radot, yet this describes Pasteur as a freethinker; and this is confirmed in the preface to the English translation by Sir W. Osler, who knew Pasteur personally. Vallery-Radot was himself a Catholic yet admits that Pasteur believed only in "an Infinite" and "hoped" for a future life. Pasteur publicly stated this himself in his Academy speech in 1822 (in V.R.). He said: "The idea of God is a form of the idea of the Infinite whether it is called Brahma, Allah, Jehova, or Jesus." The biographer says that in his last days he turned to the Church but the only "evidence" he gives is that he liked to read the life of St. Vincent de Paul, and he admits that he did not receive the sacraments at death. Relatives put rosary beads in his hands, and the Catholic Encyclopedia claims him as a Catholic in virtue of the fact and of an anonymous and inconclusive statement about him. Wheeler says in his Dictionary of Freethinkers that in his prime Pasteur was Vice-President of the British Secular (Atheist) Union; and Wheeler was the chief Secularist writer of the time. The evidence is overwhelming. Yet the Catholic scientist Sir Bertram Windle assures his readers that "no person who knows anything about him can doubt the sincerity of his attachment to the Catholic Church," and all Catholic writers use much the same scandalous language.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Louis Pasteur|year=2000|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-6529-9|author=Patrice Debr|page=176|quote=Does this mean that Pasteur was bound to a religious ideal? His attitude was that of a believer, not of a sectarian. One of his most brilliant disciples, Elie Metchnikoff, was to attest that he spoke of religion only in general terms. In fact, Pasteur evaded the question by claiming quite simply that religion has no more place in science than science has in religion.&amp;nbsp;... A biologist more than a chemist, a spiritual more than a religious man, Pasteur was held back only by the lack of more powerful technical means and therefore had to limit himself to identifying germs and explaining their generation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also against mixing science with religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Debr|first=Patrice|translator-last=Forster|translator-first=Elborg|title=Louis Pasteur|date=2000|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-6529-9|page=368|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzOcl-FLw30C&amp;pg=PA368|quote=Pasteur advocated separation of science and religion: "In each one of us there are two men, the scientist and the man of faith or of doubt.
