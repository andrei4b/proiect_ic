'''Edward Jenner''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] ({{IPAc-en||d||n|r}}; 17 May 1749  26 January 1823) was an English [[physician]] and [[scientist]] who was the pioneer of [[smallpox vaccine]], the world's first [[vaccine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stefan Riedel, MD |pmc=1200696 |title=Edward Jenner and the history of smallpox and vaccination |journal=Proceedings (Baylor University.

He used it in 1796 in the long title of his ''Inquiry into the Variolae vaccinae known as the Cow Pox'', in which he described the protective effect of cowpox against smallpox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baxby|first=Derrick|title=Edward Jenner's Inquiry; a bicentenary analysis|journal=Vaccine|year=1999|volume=17|issue=4|pages=3017|pmid=9987167|doi=10.1016/s0264-410x(98)00207-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenner is often called "the father of [[immunology]]", and his work is said to have "saved more lives than the work of any other human".&lt;ref name="JennerSundayTimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JennerBBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; In Jenners time, smallpox killed around 10 percent of the population, with the number as high as 20 percent in towns and cities where infection spread more easily.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/only-in-britain/edward-jenner-discovers-the-smallpox-vaccine/ "How did Edward Jenner test his smallpox vaccine?"]. Telegraph. Retrieved 2 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In 1821 he was appointed physician extraordinary to King [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], and was also made mayor of [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]] and justice of the peace. A member of the  [[Royal Society]], in the field of zoology he was the first person to describe the [[brood parasitism]] of the [[common cuckoo|cuckoo]]. In 2002, Jenner was named in the BBC's list of the ''[[100 Greatest Britons]]''.

==Early life==
[[File:Edward Jenner manuscript.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jenner's handwritten draft of the first vaccination is held at the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] in London]]
Edward Anthony Jenner was born on 17 May 1749&lt;ref name="About Edward Jenner"/&gt; (6 May [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]) in [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire]], as the eighth of nine children. His father, the Reverend Stephen Jenner, was the [[vicar]] of Berkeley, so Jenner received a strong basic education.&lt;ref name="About Edward Jenner"/&gt;

He went to school in [[Wotton-under-Edge]] and [[Cirencester]].&lt;ref name="About Edward Jenner"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jenner.ac.uk/edward-jenner |title=About Edward Jenner |work=The Jenner Institute |accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he was [[inoculation|inoculated]] for [[smallpox]], which had a lifelong effect upon his general health.&lt;ref name="About Edward Jenner"/&gt; At the age of 14, he was apprenticed for seven years to Daniel Ludlow, a [[surgeon]] of [[Chipping Sodbury]], South Gloucestershire, where he gained most of the experience needed to become a surgeon himself.&lt;ref name="About Edward Jenner"/&gt;

[[File:Edward Jenner, testimonial to the efficacy of vaccination. Wellcome L0020705.jpg|thumb|upright|Jenner's 1802 testimonial to the efficacy of vaccination, signed by 112 members of the [[Physical Society of London|Physical Society, London]]]]
In 1770, Jenner became apprenticed in surgery and anatomy under surgeon [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] and others at [[St George's Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jennermuseum.com/Jenner/youngedward.html |title=Young Edward Jenner, Born in Berkeley |work=Edward Jenner Museum |accessdate=4 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914084340/http://www.jennermuseum.com/Jenner/youngedward.html |archivedate=14 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Osler]] records&lt;!-- lectures at Yale in 1913 - Bartlett free bookshelf on Web --&gt; that Hunter gave Jenner [[William Harvey]]'s advice, well-known in medical circles (and characteristic of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]), "Don't think; try."&lt;ref name="Loncarek"/&gt; Hunter remained in correspondence with Jenner over [[natural history]] and proposed him for the [[Royal Society]]. Returning to his native countryside by 1773, Jenner became a successful [[general practitioner|family doctor]] and surgeon, practising on dedicated premises at Berkeley.

Jenner and others formed the Fleece Medical Society or Gloucestershire Medical Society, so called because it met in the parlour of the Fleece Inn, [[Rodborough]] (in [[Gloucestershire]]), where members dined together and read papers on medical subjects. Jenner contributed papers on [[angina pectoris]], [[ophthalmia]], and cardiac valvular disease and commented on [[cowpox]]. He also belonged to a similar society which met in [[Alveston]], near Bristol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search2?coll_id=7135&amp;inst_id=8 "Papers at the Royal College of Physicians summarised"].&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a master [[Freemasonry|mason]] on  30 December 1802, in Lodge of Faith and Friendship #449. From 18121813, he served as worshipful master of Royal Berkeley Lodge of Faith and Friendship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/jenner_e/jenner_e.html "Edward Jenner biography"].

== Zoology ==
Edward Jenner was elected fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1788,&lt;!--or 1789: the Royal Society says 9, RCS say 8 and married afterward, that year--&gt; following his publication of a careful study of the previously misunderstood life of the nested [[common cuckoo|cuckoo]], a study that combined observation, experiment, and dissection.

[[File:Cuculus canorus.jpg|thumb|left|Common cuckoo]]

He described how the newly hatched cuckoo pushed its host's eggs and fledgling chicks out of the nest (contrary to existing belief that the adult cuckoo did it).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jennermuseum.com/ej/cuckoo.shtml Jenner Museum: Cuckoo"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923015150/http://www.jennermuseum.com/ej/cuckoo.shtml |date=23 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having observed this behaviour, Jenner demonstrated an anatomical adaptation for itthe baby cuckoo has a depression in its back, not present after 12 days of life, that enables it to cup eggs and other chicks. The adult does not remain long enough in the area to perform this task. Jenner's findings were published in ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'' in 1788.&lt;ref&gt;Observations on the Natural History of the Cuckoo. By Mr. Edward Jenner. In a Letter to John Hunter, Esq. F. R. S Jenner, E Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London (17761886). 1 January 1788. 78:219237 (Text at https://archive.org/details/philtrans06624558)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cuckoo chicks evicting their nest mates: coincidental observations by Edward Jenner in England and Antoine Joseph Lottinger in France, Spencer G. Sealy and Mlanie F. Guigueno Department of Biological Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba R3T 2N2, Canada. Archives of natural history. Volume 38, Page 220-228 {{doi|10.3366/anh.2011.0030}},  {{ISSN|0260-9541}}, Available Online October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

"The singularity of its shape is well adapted to these purposes; for, different from other newly hatched birds, its back from the scapula downwards is very broad, with a considerable depression in the middle. This depression seems formed by nature for the design of giving a more secure lodgement to the egg of the Hedge-sparrow, or its young one, when the young Cuckoo is employed in removing either of them from the nest. When it is about twelve days old, this cavity is quite filled up, and then the back assumes the shape of nestling birds in general." &lt;ref&gt;(Letter to Hunter at the Royal Society, as above)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Some discrepancies in the paper are ascribed to Jenner's nephew, who is said to have fabricated certain observations.--&gt; Jenner's nephew assisted in the study. He was born on 30 June 1737.

Jenner's understanding of the cuckoo's behaviour was not entirely believed until the artist [[Jemima Blackburn]], a keen observer of bird life, saw a blind nestling pushing out a host's egg. Her description and illustration of this were enough to convince [[Charles Darwin]] to revise a later edition of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-link=Jemima Blackburn|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and human medicine==
[[File:Edward Jenner, certificate of attendance at Wellcome L0020702.jpg|thumb|upright|A lecturer's certificate of attendance given to Jenner. He attended many lectures on chemistry, medicine and physics.]]
Jenner married Catherine Kingscote (died 1815 from [[tuberculosis]]) in March 1788. He might have met her while he and other fellows were experimenting with [[balloons]]. Jenner's trial balloon descended into [[Kingscote Park, Gloucestershire]], owned by Anthony Kingscote, one of whose daughters was Catherine.&lt;ref&gt;Richard B. Fisher, Edward Jenner (Andre Deutsch, 1991) 4042&lt;/ref&gt;

He earned his MD from the [[University of St Andrews]] in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A brief history of the University | website=University of St Andrews | url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/about/history/brief/ | access-date=February 11, 2018 | quote=Through the centuries many great minds have been attracted to St Andrews:...Edward Jenner, pioneer of the smallpox vaccine (MD, 1792) }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with advancing the understanding of [[angina pectoris]].&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the Royal College of Physicians Edinburgh 2011; 41:3615 {{doi|10.4997/JRCPE.2011.416}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his correspondence with Heberden, he wrote, "How much the heart must suffer from the coronary arteries not being able to perform their functions."&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Fuster, Eric J.

==Invention of the vaccine==

[[Inoculation]] was already a standard practice but involved serious risks, one of which was the fear that those inoculated would then transfer the disease to those around them due to their becoming carriers of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/lady-montagu-and-introduction-smallpox-inoculation-england|title=Lady Montagu and the Introduction of Smallpox Inoculation to England {{!}} Muslim Heritage|website=www.muslimheritage.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1721, [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]] had imported [[variolation]] to Britain after having observed it in [[Constantinople]]. [[Voltaire]] wrote that at this time 60% of the population caught smallpox and 20% of the population died of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1778voltaire-lettres.asp#Letter%20XI |author=Franois Marie Arouet de Voltaire |title=Letters on the English or Lettres Philosophiques |year=1778 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire also states that the [[Circassia]]ns used the inoculation from times immemorial, and the custom may have been borrowed by the Turks from the Circassians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Voltaire on Circassian Medicine: ''Inoculation'' | url=http://www.circassianworld.com/new/history/miscelleneous/1202-circassian-medicine.html | publisher=Circassian World}} from {{cite book| author=Voltaire | title=The Works of Voltaire | volume=Vol. XIX (Philosophical Letters) | year=1733 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edward Jenner- Smallpox.svg|thumb|The steps taken by Edward Jenner to create vaccination, the first vaccine for smallpox. Jenner did this by inoculating James Phipps with cowpox, a virus similar to smallpox, to create immunity, unlike variolation, which used smallpox to create an immunity to itself.]]

By 1768, English physician [[John Fewster]] had realised that prior infection with cowpox rendered a person immune to smallpox.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*  George Pearson, ed., ''An Inquiry Concerning the History of the Cowpox, Principally with a View to Supersede and Extinguish the Smallpox'' (London, England:  J. Johnson, 1798), [https://books.google.com/books?id=osdEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 102104.]

Noting the common observation that milkmaids were generally immune to smallpox, Jenner postulated that the [[pus]] in the blisters that milkmaids received from [[cowpox]] (a disease similar to smallpox, but much less virulent) protected them from smallpox.

}}
[[File:Jenner phipps 01.jpg|thumb|Dr Jenner performing his first vaccination on [[James Phipps]], a boy of age 8. 14 May 1796]]
On 14 May 1796, Jenner tested his hypothesis by inoculating [[James Phipps]], an eight-year-old boy who was the son of Jenner's gardener. He scraped pus from cowpox blisters on the hands of Sarah Nelmes, a milkmaid who had caught cowpox from a cow called Blossom,&lt;ref name="JennerMuseum"/&gt; whose hide now hangs on the wall of the St George's medical school library (now in Tooting). Phipps was the 17th case described in Jenner's first paper on [[vaccination]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=1556742&amp;pageno=13 An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolae Vaccinae, Edward Jenner]. Retrieved 17 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenner inoculated Phipps in both arms that day, subsequently producing in Phipps a fever and some uneasiness, but no full-blown infection. Later, he injected Phipps with [[variolation|variolous material]], the routine method of immunization at that time. No disease followed. The boy was later challenged with variolous material and again showed no sign of infection.

}}

Donald Hopkins has written, "Jenner's unique contribution was not that he inoculated a few persons with cowpox, but that he then proved [by subsequent challenges] that they were immune to smallpox. Moreover, he demonstrated that the protective cowpox pus could be effectively inoculated from person to person, not just directly from cattle.&lt;ref name="Hopkins"/&gt; Jenner successfully tested his hypothesis on 23 additional subjects.

[[File:The cow pock.jpg|thumb|[[James Gillray]]'s 1802 caricature of Jenner vaccinating patients who feared it would make them sprout cowlike appendages.]]
[[File:Jenner and his two colleagues seeing off three anti-vaccinat Wellcome V0011075.jpg|thumb|1808 cartoon showing Jenner, [[Thomas Dimsdale]] and [[George Rose (politician)|George Rose]] seeing off anti-vaccination opponents]]
Jenner continued his research and reported it to the Royal Society, which did not publish the initial paper. After revisions and further investigations, he published his findings on the 23 cases. Some of his conclusions were correct, some erroneous; modern microbiological and microscopic methods would make his studies easier to reproduce. The medical establishment deliberated at length over his findings before accepting them. Eventually, vaccination was accepted, and in 1840, the British government banned variolation{{spaced ndash}}the use of smallpox to induce immunity{{spaced ndash}}and provided vaccination using cowpox free of charge. (See [[Vaccination/Vaccination acts|Vaccination acts]]).

The success of his discovery soon spread around Europe and was used ''en masse'' in the Spanish [[Balmis Expedition]], a three-year-long mission to the Americas, the Philippines, Macao, China, led by Dr. [[Francisco Javier de Balmis]] with the aim of giving thousands the smallpox vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Carlos Franco-Paredes |author2=Lorena Lammoglia |author3=Jos Ignacio Santos-Preciado |title=The Spanish Royal Philanthropic Expedition to Bring Smallpox Vaccination to the New World and Asia in the 19th Century |publisher=Oxford Journals |volume=41 |issue=9 |pages=12851289 |year=2005 |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/9/1285.full |doi= 10.1086/496930 |pmid=16206103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition was successful, and Jenner wrote, "I dont imagine the annals of history furnish an example of philanthropy so noble, so extensive as this."&lt;ref&gt;"Andean Studies: New Trends and Library Resources : Papers of the Forty-Fifth Annual Meeting of the Seminar on the Acquisition of Latin American Library Materials", University of California, Los Angeles ... 2731 May 2000". p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; [[Napoleon]], who at the time was at war with Britain, had all his French troops vaccinated, and at the request of Jenner he released English prisoners of war and permitted their return home.&lt;ref name="Napoleon"/&gt; Napoleon remarked he could not "refuse anything to one of the greatest benefactors of mankind."&lt;ref name="Napoleon"&gt;"Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London, Volumes 9-11. p. 297.

Jenner's continuing work on vaccination prevented him from continuing his ordinary medical practice.

In 1803 in London, he became president of the '''Jennerian Society''', concerned with promoting vaccination to eradicate [[smallpox]]. The Jennerian ceased operations in 1809. In 1808, with government aid, the National Vaccine Establishment was founded, but Jenner felt dishonoured by the men selected to run it and resigned his directorship.&lt;ref&gt;John Baron, Life of Edward Jenner (London, 1837), vol. 2, pp. 1225.&lt;/ref&gt; Jenner became a member of the Medical and Chirurgical Society on its founding in 1805 (now the [[Royal Society of Medicine]]) and presented several papers there. Jenner was also elected a foreign honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1802, and a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1806.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 17802010: Chapter J|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterJ.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to London in 1811, Jenner observed a significant number of cases of smallpox after vaccination. He found that in these cases the severity of the illness was notably diminished by previous vaccination. In 1821, he was appointed physician extraordinary to [[King George IV]], and was also made mayor of Berkeley and justice of the peace.&lt;ref name="Reward"/&gt; He continued to investigate natural history, and in 1823, the last year of his life, he presented his "Observations on the Migration of Birds" to the Royal Society.&lt;ref name="Reward"/&gt;

== Death ==
Jenner was found in a state of [[apoplexy]] on 25 January 1823, with his right side paralysed. He never fully recovered and eventually died of an apparent stroke, his second, on 26 January 1823, aged 73. He was buried in the Jenner family vault at the Church of St. Mary's, [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stmarys-berkeley.co.uk/history/60-edward-jenner|title=Edward Jenner  St Mary's Church, Berkeley, Gloucestershire|accessdate=15 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920055356/http://www.stmarys-berkeley.co.uk/history/60-edward-jenner|archivedate=20 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenner was survived by one son and one daughter, his elder son having died of tuberculosis aged 21.&lt;ref&gt;Darren R.

Neither fanatic nor lax,&lt;ref&gt;Horne, Charles F.. 1894.

Gjenvick-Gjnvik Archives&lt;/ref&gt; Jenner was a [[Christian]] who in his personal correspondence showed himself quite spiritual; he treasured the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;Baron, John, 1838.

See pages 141, 179, 221, 282, 295, 317, 416, 447448&lt;/ref&gt; Some days before his death, he stated to a friend: "I am not surprised that men are not grateful to me; but I wonder that they are not grateful to God for the good which he has made me the instrument of conveying to my fellow creatures."&lt;ref&gt;Nolie Mumey, Edward Jenner; 1949. ''Vaccination: bicentenary of the birth of Edward Jenner, Volume 1''. Range Press, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;
However, his contemporary Rabbi [[Israel Lipschitz]] in his classic commentary on the Mishna [[Tiferet Yisrael (commentary)|Tiferet Yisrael]] wrote that Jenner was one of the "righteous of the nations," deserving a lofty place in the World to Come, for having saved millions of people from smallpox.&lt;ref&gt;Tiferet Yisrael (Boaz) on Avot 3:14&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

In 1979, the [[World Health Organization]] declared smallpox an eradicated disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=World Health Organization |title=Smallpox |year=2001 |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/smallpox/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the result of coordinated public health efforts, but vaccination was an essential component. Although the disease was declared eradicated, some pus samples still remain in laboratories in [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] in [[Atlanta]] in the US, and in [[State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR]] in [[Koltsovo, Novosibirsk Oblast]], Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jul/08/smallpox-vials-found-cardboard-box-maryland-laboratory "Forgotten smallpox vials found in cardboard box at Maryland laboratory"]. The Guardian. Retrieved 19 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenner's vaccine laid the foundation for contemporary discoveries in [[immunology]].&lt;ref name="JennerEssortment"/&gt; In 2002, Jenner was named in the [[BBC]]'s list of the [[100 Greatest Britons]] following a UK-wide vote. The [[moon|lunar]] crater [[Jenner (crater)|Jenner]] is named in his honour. Jenner was recognized in the TV show ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|''The Walking Dead'']]''.  In "[[TS-19]]", a CDC scientist is named Edwin Jenner.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0233292/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_11&lt;/ref&gt;
