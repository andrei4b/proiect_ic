He is an honorary Life President of the club, and in 2014 had a stand named after him at the club's [[Vicarage Road|home stadium]].

Raised in the [[Pinner]] area of London, John learned to play piano at an early age, and by 1962 had formed [[Bluesology]]. John met his songwriting partner, Bernie Taupin, in 1967, after they had both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years they wrote songs for other artists, including [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], and John also worked as a session musician for artists such as [[the Hollies]] and [[the Scaffold]]. In 1969 his debut album, ''[[Empty Sky]]'', was released. In 1970 a single, "[[Your Song]]", from his second album, ''[[Elton John (album)|Elton John]]'', reached the top ten in the UK and the US, his first hit single. After decades of commercial chart success, John has also achieved success in musical theatre, both in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], composing the music for ''[[The Lion King (franchise)|The Lion King]]'' ([[The Lion King|film]] and [[The Lion King (musical)|musical]]), ''[[Aida (musical)|Aida]]'' and ''[[Billy Elliot the Musical]]''.

== Life and career ==

=== Early life ===
Elton John was born Reginald Kenneth Dwight on 25 March 1947, in [[Pinner]], [[Middlesex]], the eldest child of Stanley Dwight (19251991) and only child of Sheila Eileen ([[ne]] Harris; 19252017),&lt;ref name="Hayward2013"&gt;{{cite book |first=Keith |last=Hayward |title=Tin Pan Alley: The Rise of Elton John |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PEgPhgVOPpUC&amp;pg=PT2 |date=January 2013 |publisher=Soundcheck Books |isbn=978-0-9571442-0-0 |pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1435132/Family-detective-Elton-John.html |title=Family Detective: Elton John |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=22 November 2006 |accessdate=26 March 2015 |last=Barratt |first=Nick |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913239,00.html |title=Elton John Rock's Captain Fantastic |date=7 July 1975 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was raised in a [[council house]] by his maternal grandparents, in Pinner. His parents married in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Marriages: MAR 1945 3a 1257 Dwight Stanley = Harris Sheila E&lt;/ref&gt; when the family moved to a nearby semi-detached house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onthisveryspot.com/spot/Elton_John_Birthplace |title=55 Pinner Hill Road |publisher=On This Very Spot |date=25 March 1947 |accessdate=25 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barratt |first=Nick |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/exclusions/familyhistory/fheltonjohn.xml |title=Family detective: Elton John |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=24 November 2006 |accessdate=25 February 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onthisveryspot.com/spot/111_Potter_Street |title=111 Potter Street |publisher=On This Very Spot |date=15 July 2007 |accessdate=25 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at Pinner Wood Junior School, Reddiford School and [[Pinner County Grammar School]], until the age of 17, when he left just prior to his [[GCE Advanced Level|A-Level]] examinations to pursue a career in the music industry.&lt;ref name="Norman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Norman |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Norman (author) |date=1991 |title=Elton John |publisher=Fireside |isbn=0671797298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"&gt;Elizabeth Rosenthal, ''His Song: The Musical Journey of Elton John'', Billboard Books, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VisualDoc"&gt;{{cite book |title=Elton John: The Visual Documentary |first=Nigel |last=Goodall |year=1993 |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |isbn=0-7119-3078-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he began to seriously consider a career in music, Elton John's father, who served as a [[flight lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Air Force]], tried to steer him toward a more conventional career, such as banking.&lt;ref name="Norman"/&gt; John has stated that his wild stage costumes and performances were his way of letting go after such a restrictive childhood.&lt;ref name="VisualDoc" /&gt; Both of John's parents were musically inclined, his father having been a trumpet player with the Bob Millar Band, a semi-professional big band that played at military dances.&lt;ref name="VisualDoc"/&gt; The Dwights were keen record buyers, exposing John to the popular singers and musicians of the day, and John remembers being immediately hooked on rock and roll when his mother brought home records by [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Bill Haley &amp; His Comets]] in 1956.&lt;ref name="Norman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;

Elton John started playing the piano at the age of three, and within a year, his mother heard him picking out [[Winifred Atwell]]'s "The Skater's Waltz" by ear.&lt;ref name="Norman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; After performing at parties and family gatherings, at the age of 7 he took up formal piano lessons. He showed musical aptitude at school, including the ability to compose melodies, and gained some notoriety by playing like [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] at school functions.  At the age of 11, he won a junior scholarship to the [[Royal Academy of Music]]. According to one of his instructors, John promptly played back, like a "gramophone record", a four-page piece by [[Handel]] that he heard for the first time.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;
[[File:Royal Academy of Music.jpg|thumb|right|Elton studied at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in London for five years.]]
For the next five years, he attended Saturday classes at the Academy in central London, and has stated that he enjoyed playing [[Frdric Chopin|Chopin]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and singing in the choir during Saturday classes, but that he was not otherwise a diligent classical student.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;  "I kind of resented going to the Academy", he says.  "I was one of those children who could just about get away without practising and still pass, scrape through the grades."&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; He has claimed that he would sometimes skip classes and ride around on [[London Underground|the Tube]].&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; Several instructors have testified that he was a "model student", and during the last few years, he was taking lessons from a private tutor in addition to his classes at the Academy.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;

Elton John's mother, though also strict with her son, was more vivacious than her husband, and something of a free spirit.  With Stanley Dwight uninterested in his son and often physically absent, John was raised primarily by his mother and maternal grandmother.  When his father was home, the Dwights would have terrible arguments that greatly distressed their son.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; When John was 14, they divorced. His mother then married a local painter, Fred Farebrother, a caring and supportive stepfather whom John affectionately referred to as "Derf", his first name in reverse.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; They moved into flat No.&amp;nbsp;1A in an eight-unit apartment building called Frome Court, not far from both previous homes.  It was there that John wrote the songs that launched his career as a rock star; he lived there until he had four albums simultaneously in the American Top 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onthisveryspot.com/spot/EJ_Frome_Court |title=Frome Court |publisher=On This Very Spot |date=3 April 2007 |accessdate=25 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 15, with the help of his mother and stepfather, Reginald Dwight became a weekend pianist at a nearby pub, the Northwood Hills Hotel, playing Thursday to Sunday nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qOECAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA76 |title=Music |work=Atlanta Magazine |page=76 |accessdate=15 January 2016 |date=June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onthisveryspot.com/find/spot.php?spot_web_name=Northwood_Hills_Pub |title=Northwood Hills Pub  On This Very Spot |publisher=onthisveryspot.com |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known simply as "Reggie", he played a range of popular standards, including songs by [[Jim Reeves]] and [[Ray Charles]], as well as songs he had written himself.&lt;ref name="Costello interview"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Elton John |url=http://www.sundancechannel.com/films/500328605 |series=Spectacle |serieslink=Spectacle: Elvis Costello with... |airdate=2008 |season=1 |number=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428144534/http://www.sundancechannel.com/films/500328605 |archivedate=28 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bernadin|Stanton|1996|p=70}} A stint with a short-lived group called the Corvettes rounded out his time.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal" /&gt;

In 1962, Dwight and his friends formed a band called [[Bluesology]]. By day, he ran errands for a music publishing company; he divided his nights between solo gigs at a London hotel bar and working with Bluesology. By the mid-1960s, Bluesology was backing touring American [[soul music|soul]] and [[R&amp;B]] musicians like [[the Isley Brothers]], [[Major Lance]] and [[Labelle|Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles]]. In 1966, the band became musician [[Long John Baldry]]'s supporting band, and played 16 times at the [[Marquee Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themarqueeclub.net/long-john-baldry |title=The Marquee Club: Long John Baldry  Biography |publisher=themarqueeclub.net |accessdate=25 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704172041/http://www.themarqueeclub.net/long-john-baldry |archivedate=4 July 2010 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EltonJohnPiano.jpg|thumb|right|The 1910 piano on which Elton John composed his first five albums, including his first hit single, "[[Your Song]]"]]

When the two first met in 1967, they recorded what would become the first Elton John/Bernie Taupin song: "Scarecrow".

It came [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1969|sixth]] of six songs.

On the advice of music publisher Steve Brown, John and Taupin started writing more complex songs for John to record for DJM. The first was the single "I've Been Loving You" (1968), produced by [[Caleb Quaye]], former Bluesology guitarist. In 1969, with Quaye, drummer Roger Pope, and bassist Tony Murray, John recorded another single, "[[Lady Samantha]]", and an album, ''[[Empty Sky]]''. For their follow-up album, ''[[Elton John (album)|Elton John]]'', Elton John and Bernie Taupin enlisted [[Gus Dudgeon]] as producer and [[Paul Buckmaster]] as musical arranger. ''Elton John'' was released in April 1970 on DJM Records/[[Pye Records]] in the UK and [[Uni Records]] in the US, and established the formula for subsequent albums  gospel-chorded rockers and poignant ballads. The first single from the album, "[[Border Song]]", made into the [[Billboard Hot 100|US Top 100]], peaking at Number 92. The second single, "[[Your Song]]", reached number seven in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and number eight in the US, becoming John's first hit single as a singer.&lt;ref name="Charts"&gt;[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/Elton%20John "Elton John: UK Chart History"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214060116/http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/Elton%20John |date=14 February 2015 }}.

John formed his own label named [[The Rocket Record Company]] (distributed in the US by MCA and initially by Island in the UK) and signed acts to it  notably [[Neil Sedaka]] ("Bad Blood", on which he sang background vocals) and [[Kiki Dee]]  with whom he took a personal interest.

In 1974, a collaboration with [[John Lennon]] took place, resulting in Lennon's appearance on Elton John's single cover of the Beatles' "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]", the B-side of which was Lennon's "One Day at a Time." In return, John was featured on "[[Whatever Gets You thru the Night]]" on Lennon's ''[[Walls and Bridges]]'' album. Later that year in what would be Lennon's last major live performance, the pair performed these two number&amp;nbsp;1 hits along with the Beatles classic "[[I Saw Her Standing There]]" at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York. Lennon made the rare stage appearance with John and his band to keep the promise he made that he would appear on stage with him if "Whatever Gets You Thru The Night" became a US number one single.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Woolf, Scott Jennings and James L.

"[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]" was the hit single from this album and captured an early turning point in Elton John's life.

Elton John has written with his songwriting partner [[Bernie Taupin]] since 1967 when he answered an advertisement for talent placed in the popular UK music publication, ''[[New Musical Express]]'', by [[Liberty records]] [[A&amp;R]] man [[Ray Williams (producer)|Ray Williams]].&lt;ref name="bilb"/&gt; The pair have collaborated on more than 30 albums to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/index.php/exhibits/bio/C181 |title=Songwriters Hall of Fame  Bernie Taupin Biography |publisher=songwritershalloffame.org |accessdate=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writing style that Elton John and Bernie Taupin use involves Taupin writing the lyrics on his own, and John then putting them to music, with the two never in the same room during the process. Taupin would write a set of lyrics, then post them to John, wherever he was in the world, who would then lay down the music, arrange it, and record.&lt;ref&gt;Syd Field

==Personal life==

===Sexuality and family===

In the late 1960s, Elton John was engaged to be married to his first lover, secretary Linda Woodrow, who is mentioned in the song "[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]".&lt;ref name=RS76&gt;{{cite web |first=Cliff |last=Jahr |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/davidbowie/articles/story/8718858/elton_john_its_lonely_at_the_top |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QZv8N38L?url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/davidbowie/articles/story/8718858/elton_john_its_lonely_at_the_top |archivedate=24 July 2007 |title=Elton John: It's Lonely at the Top |work=Rolling Stone |date=7 October 1976 |accessdate=25 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite book |author=Paul Myers |url=https://books.google.com/?id=l118517OoewC&amp;pg=PA133 |title=''It Ain't Easy: Long John Baldry and the Birth of the British Blues'', page 133 |publisher=Greystone Books, 2007, {{ISBN|1-55365-200-2}} |accessdate=2 February 2010 |isbn=978-1-55365-200-7 |date=6 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He married German recording engineer Renate Blauel on 14 February 1984, in [[Darling Point, New South Wales|Darling Point]], Sydney, with speculation that the marriage was a [[beard (companion)|cover]] for his homosexuality. John came out as [[bisexual]] in a 1976 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'',&lt;ref name=RS76/&gt;&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt; but after his divorce from Blauel in 1988, he told the magazine he was "comfortable" being gay.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Rhiel, David Bruce Suchoff, {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1o8YQZQhqGoC&amp;pg=PA23 |title=''The seductions of biography'' |page=23 |publisher=Routledge |year=1996 |accessdate=2 February 2010 |isbn=978-0-415-91090-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, he began a relationship with [[David Furnish]], a former advertising executive and now filmmaker originally from [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. On 21 December 2005 (the day the [[Civil Partnership Act 2004|Civil Partnership Act]] came into force), John and Furnish were amongst the first couples in the UK to form a [[civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partnership]], which was held at the [[Windsor Guildhall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Independent |date=8 October 2012 |first=Elton |last=John |title=The historic fight for equality must go on.

In 2010, John was criticised by some Christian groups in the US after describing Jesus as a "compassionate, super-intelligent gay man who understood human problems". [[William Anthony Donohue]], president of the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights]] and opponent of gay marriage, responded: "To call Jesus a homosexual is to label him a sexual deviant. But what else would we expect from a man who previously said, 'From my point of view, I would ban religion completely.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/feb/19/elton-john-jesus-gay |title=Sir Elton John claims Jesus was gay |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=19 February 2010 |accessdate=8 March 2015 |first=Adam |last=Gabbatt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, John stated he preferred civil partnerships over marriage for gay people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.frontiersmedia.com/frontiers-blog/2014/12/22/sir-elton-john-david-furnish-get-married-sharethelove/ |title=Sir Elton John and David Furnish Get Married, #ShareTheLove |date=22 December 2014 |accessdate=8 March 2015 |first=Karen |last=Ocamb |work=Frontiers Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2012, John had changed his position and become a staunch supporter of [[same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom]]. He was quoted as saying: "There is a world of difference between calling someone your 'partner' and calling them your 'husband'. 'Partner' is a word that should be preserved for people you play tennis with, or work alongside in business. It doesn't come close to describing the love that I have for David, and he for me.

==AIDS Foundation==

John has said that he took risks with unprotected sex during the 1980s and considers himself lucky to have avoided the AIDS epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/elton-john-science-can-stop-aids-but-to-end-the-plague-we-need-love-7966167.html |title=Elton John: Science can stop Aids but to end the plague we need love |work=The Independent |first=Elton |last=John |date=24 July 2012 |accessdate=8 March 2015 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, he joined with [[Dionne Warwick]], [[Gladys Knight]] and [[Stevie Wonder]] to record the single "[[That's What Friends Are For]]", with all profits being donated to the [[American Foundation for AIDS Research]]. The song won John and the others the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]]. In April 1990, John performed his 1968 ballad "[[Skyline Pigeon]]" at the funeral of [[Ryan White]], a teenage [[haemophiliac]] he had befriended.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Bernardin (1995).

Elton John became more closely associated with AIDS charities following the deaths of his friends Ryan White in 1990 and [[Freddie Mercury]] in 1991, raising large amounts of money and using his public profile to raise awareness of the disease. He founded the [[Elton John AIDS Foundation]] in 1992 as a charity to fund programmes for HIV/AIDS prevention, for the elimination of prejudice and discrimination against HIV/AIDS-affected individuals, and for providing services to people living with or at risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. This cause continues to be one of his personal passions. In 1993, he began hosting his annual [[Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party|Academy Award Party]], which has become one of the highest-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry, and has raised over {{US$|200&amp;nbsp;million|link=yes}}.&lt;ref name="Foundation"/&gt; In early 2006, John donated the smaller of two bright-red [[Yamaha (manufacturer)|Yamaha]] pianos from his [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], Nevada show to auction on eBay to raise public awareness and funds for the foundation.

To raise money for his AIDS charity, he annually hosts a White Tie &amp; Tiara Ball in the grounds of his home in [[Old Windsor]] in Berkshire to which many famous celebrities are invited.&lt;ref name="Ball"&gt;[http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG8596113/Fashion-royalty-at-Elton-Johns-White-Tie-and-Tiara-Ball-2011.html "Fashion royalty at Elton John's White Tie and Tiara Ball 2011"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115210716/http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG8596113/Fashion-royalty-at-Elton-Johns-White-Tie-and-Tiara-Ball-2011.html |date=15 January 2016 }}.

Ray Cooper has worked on and off with the Elton John Band because he maintains obligations to other musicians as a [[session musician|session player]] and [[sideman]] as a road-tour percussionist.
