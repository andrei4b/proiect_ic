The eighth child of the [[Jackson family]], Michael made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers [[Jackie Jackson|Jackie]], [[Tito Jackson|Tito]], [[Jermaine Jackson|Jermaine]], and [[Marlon Jackson|Marlon]] as a member of [[the Jackson 5]]. He began his solo career in 1971 while at [[Motown|Motown Records]]. In the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music. His [[music video]]s, including those of "[[Beat It]]", "[[Billie Jean]]", and "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]" from his 1982 album ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'', are credited with breaking [[Racism in the United States#African Americans|racial barriers]] and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. The popularity of these videos helped bring the television channel [[MTV]] to fame. Jackson's 1987 album ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]'' spawned the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one singles "[[I Just Can't Stop Loving You]]", "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]", "[[The Way You Make Me Feel]]", "[[Man in the Mirror]]", and "[[Dirty Diana]]", becoming the first album to have five number-one singles in the nation. He continued to innovate with videos such as "[[Black or White]]" and "[[Scream/Childhood|Scream]]" throughout the 1990s, and forged a reputation as a touring solo artist. Through stage and video performances, Jackson popularized a number of complicated dance techniques, such as the [[robot (dance)|robot]] and the [[moonwalk (dance)|moonwalk]], to which he gave the name.

Jackson became a figure of controversy in the 1980s due to his changing [[Michael Jackson's health and appearance|physical appearance]], his [[Personal relationships of Michael Jackson|relationships]], and behavior; the controversy intensified due to a [[1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson|1993 child sexual abuse scandal]] when a family friend accused him of sexually abusing his son; the case led to an investigation but was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|first= Josh |last= Mankiewicz|date= September 3, 2004 |url= http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5906855/ns/dateline_nbc-newsmakers/t/new-details-about-jackson-case/ |title= New details about 1993 Jackson case |agency= [[NBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, he was [[Trial of Michael Jackson|tried and acquitted]] of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges after the jury found him not guilty on all counts.

Jackson's fifth solo album, ''[[Off the Wall]]'' (1979), co-produced by Jackson and Jones, established Jackson as a solo performer.

===19841985: Pepsi, "We Are the World", and business career===
In November 1983 Jackson and his brothers partnered with [[PepsiCo]] in a $5 million promotional deal that broke records for a celebrity endorsement. The first [[Pepsi|Pepsi Cola]] campaign, which ran in the United States from 1983 to 1984 and launched its iconic "New Generation" theme, included tour sponsorship, public relations events, and in-store displays. Jackson, who was involved in creating the advertisement, suggested using his song "Billie Jean" as its [[jingle]] with revised lyrics.&lt;ref name="Herrera2"&gt;{{cite magazine|first= Monica |last= Herrera |date= July 3, 2009 |title= Michael Jackson, Pepsi Made Marketing History |url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/268213/michael-jackson-pepsi-made-marketing-history?page=0%2C0 |magazine= Billboard |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a ''Billboard'' report in 2009, Brian J. Murphy, executive VP of branded management at TBA Global, said: "You couldn't separate the tour from the endorsement from the licensing of the music, and then the integration of the music into the Pepsi fabric."&lt;ref name="Herrera2"/&gt;

On January 27, 1984, Michael and other members of the Jacksons filmed a Pepsi commercial overseen by executive [[Phil Dusenberry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Louise |last= Story |date= December 31, 2007 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/31/business/media/31dusenberry.html |title= Philip B.

During a simulated concert before a full house of fans, pyrotechnics accidentally set Jackson's hair on fire, causing [[Burn|second-degree burns]] to his scalp. Jackson underwent treatment to hide the scars and had his third [[rhinoplasty]] shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="T20510"/&gt; Pepsi settled out of court, and Jackson donated the $1.5 million settlement to the Brotman Medical Center in [[Culver City, California]]; its Michael Jackson Burn Center is named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;Taraborrelli, 2009, pp. 279287.&lt;/ref&gt; Dusenberry recounted the episode in his memoir, ''Then We Set His Hair on Fire: Insights and Accidents from a Hall of Fame Career in Advertising''. Jackson signed a second agreement with Pepsi in the late 1980s for a reported $10 million. The second campaign had a global reach of more than 20 countries and would provide financial support for Jackson's ''Bad'' album and 198788 world tour.&lt;ref name="Herrera2"/&gt; Although Jackson had endorsements and advertising deals with other companies, such as [[LA Gear]], [[Suzuki]], and [[Sony]], none were as significant as his deals with Pepsi, which later signed other music stars such as [[Britney Spears]] and [[Beyonc]] to promote its products.&lt;ref name="Herrera2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Beyonc And Pepsi Strike Estimated $50 Million Multi-Level Partnership |url= https://music.yahoo.com/blogs/hip-hop-media-training/beyonc%C3%A9-pepsi-strike-estimated-50-million-multi-level-184957741.html |format= blog |publisher= Hip-Hop Media Training.

Jackson's humanitarian work was recognized on May 14, 1984, when he was invited to the White House to receive an award from President [[Ronald Reagan]] for his support of charities that helped people overcome alcohol and drug abuse,&lt;ref&gt;Taraborrelli, 2009, pp. 3047.&lt;/ref&gt; and in recognition of his support for the [[Ad Council]]'s and the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]'s Drunk Driving Prevention campaign.

Unlike later albums, ''Thriller'' did not have an official tour, but the [[Victory Tour (The Jacksons tour)|Victory Tour]] of 1984 headlined the Jacksons and showcased much of Jackson's new solo material to more than two million Americans. It was the last tour he would do with his brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Taraborrelli, 2009, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; Following controversy over the concert's ticket sales,{{Why?|date=January 2017}} Jackson held a press conference and announced that he would donate his share of the proceeds, an estimated {{Nowrap|$3 to 5 million}}, to charity.&lt;ref&gt;Taraborrelli, 2009, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taraborrelli, 2009, pp. 315320.&lt;/ref&gt; His charitable work and humanitarian awards continued with the release of "[[We Are the World]]" (1985), co-written with [[Lionel Richie]].&lt;ref name="WATW"&gt;{{cite web|title= Past Winners Search: "We Are The World" |publisher= The Recording Academy |url= http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&amp;field_nominee_work_value=%22We+Are+The+World%22&amp;year=All&amp;genre=All |accessdate= January 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was recorded on January 28, 1985&lt;ref name="AMAs 1986"&gt;{{cite news|title= Bruce shows who's Boss |newspaper= [[Montreal Gazette]] |agency= Associated Press |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MRgiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7aUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1658,3425033 |date= January 28, 1986 |accessdate= June 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released worldwide in March 1985 to aid the poor in the United States and Africa.&lt;ref name="jdoyle"&gt;{{cite web|first= Jack |last= Doyle |date= July 7, 2009 |url= http://www.pophistorydig.com/topics/michael-mccartney-1980s-2009/ |title= "Michael &amp; McCartney": 1980s2009 |work= The Pop History Dig |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song earned $63 million for famine relief,&lt;ref name="jdoyle"/&gt; and became one of the [[List of best-selling singles|best-selling singles of all time]], with 20 million copies sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Anthony |last= Breznican |url= https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2009-06-26-jackson-faces_N.htm |title= The many faces of Michael Jackson |date= June 30, 2009 |newspaper= [[USA Today]] |accessdate= June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It won four Grammys for 1985, including Song of the Year for Jackson and Richie as its writers.&lt;ref name="WATW"/&gt; Although the American Music Award directors removed the charity song from the competition because they felt it would be inappropriate, the AMA show in 1986 concluded with a tribute to the song in honor of its first anniversary. The project's creators received two special AMA honors: one for the creation of the song and another for the [[USA for Africa]] idea. Jackson, Jones, and entertainment promoter Ken Kragan received special awards for their roles in the song's creation.&lt;ref name="WATW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AMAs 1986"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 1993, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, 2009, p. 3404.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson's financial interests in the music publishing business grew after he collaborated with [[Paul McCartney]] in the early 1980s and learned that McCartney was making approximately $40 million a year from other people's songs.&lt;ref name="jdoyle"/&gt; By 1983, Jackson had begun investing in publishing rights to songs that others had written, but he was careful with his acquisitions, only bidding on a few of the dozens that were offered to him. Jackson's early acquisitions of [[music catalog]]s and song copyrights such as the [[Sly Stone]] collection included "Everyday People" (1968), [[Len Barry]]'s "[[1-2-3 (Len Barry song)|1-2-3]]" (1965), and [[Dion DiMucci]]'s "[[The Wanderer (Dion song)|The Wanderer]]" (1961) and "[[Runaround Sue]]" (1961); however, his most significant purchase came in 1985, when he acquired the publishing rights to [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing#Acquisition|ATV Music Publishing]] after months of negotiation.&lt;ref name="jdoyle"/&gt; ATV had acquired the publishing rights to nearly 4000 songs, including the [[Northern Songs]] catalog that contained the majority of the [[LennonMcCartney]] compositions recorded by the [[the Beatles|Beatles]].&lt;ref name="hilburn"&gt;{{cite news|first= Robert |last= Hilburn |date= September 22, 1985 |url= http://www.latimes.com/la-et-hilburn-michael-jackson-sep22-story.html |title= The long and winding road |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 [[Robert Holmes  Court]], the wealthy Australian investor who owned ATV Music Publishing, announced he was putting the ATV catalog up for sale.&lt;ref name="hilburn"/&gt; In 1981, McCartney was offered the ATV music catalog for 20 million ($40 million).&lt;ref name="jdoyle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="T3338"&gt;Taraborrelli, 2009, pp. 3338.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcca atv"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://mjjinfo.blogspot.fr/2010/11/paul-mccartney-refused-to-buy-atv.html |title= Paul McCartney refused an offer to buy the ATV Catalog for 20 million ($40 million USD) |publisher= Mjjinfo.blogspot.fr |date= November 13, 2010 |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to McCartney, he contacted [[Yoko Ono]] about making a joint purchase by splitting the cost at 10 million each, but Ono thought they could buy it for 5 million each.&lt;ref name="jdoyle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcca atv"/&gt; When they were unable to make a joint purchase, McCartney, who did not want to be the sole owner of the Beatles' songs, did not pursue an offer on his own.&lt;ref name="T3338"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcca atv"/&gt; According to a negotiator for Holmes  Court in the 1984 sale, McCartney was given first right of refusal and declined to purchase.&lt;ref name="ch7news"&gt;{{cite episode|title= Michael Jackson 19582009 |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3htpIVyUtec |series= [[Today Tonight]] |date= June 25, 2009 |minutes= Coverage of the sale of ATV Music at 2:36 |accessdate= January 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson was informed of the sale by his attorney, John Branca, in September 1984.&lt;ref name="hilburn"/&gt; An attorney for McCartney also assured Branca that McCartney was not interested in bidding. McCartney reportedly felt it was too expensive,&lt;ref name="jdoyle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="T3338"/&gt; but several other companies and investors were interested in bidding. Jackson submitted a bid of $46 million on November 20, 1984.&lt;ref name="hilburn"/&gt; His agents thought they had a deal several times, but encountered new bidders or new areas of debate. In May 1985, Jackson's team left talks after having spent more than $1 million and four months of [[due diligence]] work on the negotiations.&lt;ref name="hilburn"/&gt; In June 1985, Jackson and Branca learned that [[Charles Koppelman]]'s and [[Martin Bandier|Marty Bandier]]'s The Entertainment Company had made a tentative agreement with Holmes  Court to buy ATV Music for $50 million; however, in early August, Holmes  Court's team contacted Jackson and talks resumed. Jackson raised his bid to $47.5 million, which was accepted because he could close the deal more quickly, having already completed due diligence of ATV Music.&lt;ref name="hilburn"/&gt; Jackson also agreed to visit Holmes  Court in Australia, where he would appear on the [[Channel Seven Perth Telethon]].&lt;ref name="ch7news"/&gt; Jackson's [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing#Acquisition|purchase of ATV Music]] was finalized on August 10, 1985.&lt;ref name="hilburn"/&gt;

{{See also|Michael Jackson's health and appearance}}
Jackson's skin had been a medium-brown color during his youth, but from the mid-1980s gradually grew paler. The change gained widespread media coverage, including rumors that he might have been [[Skin whitening|bleaching his skin]].&lt;ref name="C146"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parameswaran, 2011, pp. 7577&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DeMello, 2012, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; According to J. Randy Taraborrelli's biography, Jackson was diagnosed with [[vitiligo]] in 1984; vitiligo results in white patches on the skin. Although Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo, Taraborrelli stated that Jackson had been skin bleaching. He said that Jackson was diagnosed with [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]], and that while the vitiligo partially lightened Jackson's skin, the lupus was in [[Remission (medicine)|remission]]. Both illnesses made Jackson's skin sensitive to sunlight. The treatments Jackson used for his condition further lightened his skin, and, with the application of pancake makeup to even out blotches he could appear pale.&lt;ref&gt;Taraborrelli, 2009, pp. 4346.&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson stated that although he used makeup to control the patchy appearance of his skin, he never purposely bleached his skin. He said of his vitiligo: "It is something I cannot help. When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me. It's a problem for me. I can't control it."&lt;ref name="Oprah-Jackson"&gt;{{cite web|title= The Michael Jackson Interview: Oprah Reflects |publisher= [[The Oprah Winfrey Show]] |page= 3 |date= September 16, 2009 |accessdate= April 24, 2017 |url= http://www.oprah.com/entertainment/oprah-reflects-on-her-interview-with-michael-jackson/3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson was also diagnosed with vitiligo in his autopsy, though not lupus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Michael Jackson case report |publisher= Tmz.vo.llnwd.net |url= http://tmz.vo.llnwd.net/o28/newsdesk/tmz_documents/0208_mj_case_report_wm.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson stated he had had only two rhinoplasties and no other facial surgery, although at one point mentioned having had a [[Cleft chin|dimple]] created in his chin. He lost weight in the early 1980s because of a change in diet and a desire for "a dancer's body".&lt;ref name="J22930"&gt;Jackson, 2009, pp. 229230.&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses reported that he was often dizzy, and speculated he was suffering from [[anorexia nervosa]]. Periods of weight loss would become a recurring problem later in life.&lt;ref&gt;Taraborrelli, 2009, pp. 3123.&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of his treatment, Jackson made two close friends: his dermatologist, Dr. [[Arnold Klein]], and Klein's nurse [[Debbie Rowe]]. Rowe eventually became Jackson's second wife and the mother of his two eldest children. He also relied heavily on Klein for medical and business advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Nicola |last= Pittam |date= May 8, 2010 |url= http://www.nationalledger.com/pop-culture-news/michael-jackson-secret-boyfrie-227202.shtml |title= Michael Jackson Secret Boyfriend Claims Draw Fury |newspaper= The National Ledger |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson became the subject of increasingly sensational reports. In 1986, the [[Tabloid journalism|tabloids]] ran a story claiming that he slept in a [[hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric oxygen chamber]] to slow the aging process; he was pictured lying in a glass box.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why not just tell people I'm an alien from Mars? Tell them I eat live chickens and do a voodoo dance at midnight. They'll believe anything ''you'' say, because ''you're a reporter''. But if I, Michael Jackson, were to say, "I'm an alien from Mars and I eat live chickens and do a voodoo dance at midnight," people would say, "Oh, man, that Michael Jackson is ''nuts''. He's cracked up. You can't believe a single word that comes out of his mouth."&lt;ref&gt;Taraborrelli, 2009, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jackson collaborated with filmmakers [[George Lucas]] and [[Francis Ford Coppola]] on the 17-minute [[3D film]] ''[[Captain EO]]'', which debuted in September 1986 at both the original [[Disneyland]] and at [[Epcot]] in Florida, and in March 1987 at [[Tokyo Disneyland]].

Jackson founded the [[Heal the World Foundation]] in 1992. The charity brought underprivileged children to Jackson's ranch to enjoy the property's theme park rides, and sent millions of dollars around the globe to help children threatened by war, poverty, and disease. In the same year, Jackson published his second book, ''[[Dancing the Dream]],'' a collection of poetry, revealing a more intimate side. While it was a commercial success, it received mostly negative reviews. In 2009, the book was republished by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and was more positively received by some critics in the wake of Jackson's death.

In January 1993, Jackson performed at the [[Super Bowl XXVII]] halftime show in Pasadena, California.

The performance began with Jackson catapulting onto the stage as fireworks went off behind him, followed by four songs: "[[Jam (song)|Jam]]", "Billie Jean", "Black or White", and "Heal the World". Jackson's ''Dangerous'' album rose 90 places in the album chart after the performance.&lt;ref name="C146"&gt;Campbell, 1995, pp. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson gave a 90-minute interview to [[Oprah Winfrey]] on February 10, 1993, his second television interview since 1979. He grimaced when speaking of his childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood years, admitting that he often cried from loneliness. He denied tabloid rumors that he had bought the bones of the [[Joseph Merrick|Elephant Man]], slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, or bleached his skin, and stated for the first time that he had vitiligo. ''Dangerous'' re-entered the album chart in the top 10, more than a year after its original release.&lt;ref name="LJ1658"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C146"/&gt;&lt;ref name="G456"/&gt;

In February 1993, Jackson was given the "Living Legend Award" at the [[35th Annual Grammy Awards]] in Los Angeles. "Black or White" was Grammy-nominated for best vocal performance.

A decade after the fact, during the second round of child abuse allegations, Jackson's lawyers would file a memo stating that the 1994 settlement was made without his consent.&lt;ref name="Court"/&gt; A later disclosure by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] of investigation documents compiled over nearly 20 years led Jackson's attorney to suggest that no evidence of molestation or sexual impropriety from Jackson toward minors existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Lee |last= Ferran |first2= Eileen |last2= Murphy |date= December 23, 2009 |url= http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/michael-jackson-attorney-fbi-files-vindication/story?id=9407615 |title= Jackson Attorney: FBI Files Are 'Almost Vindication' |publisher= [[ABC News]] |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to reports, the [[Department of Children and Family Services (Los Angeles County)]] investigated Jackson beginning in 1993 with the Chandler allegation and again in 2003.

In May 1994, Jackson married [[Lisa Marie Presley]], the daughter of [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] and [[Priscilla Presley]]. They had met in 1975, when a seven-year-old Presley attended one of Jackson's family engagements at the [[Bally's Las Vegas|MGM Grand Hotel and Casino]], and reconnected through a mutual friend.&lt;ref&gt;Taraborrelli, 2009, pp. 50007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a friend of Presley's, "their adult friendship began in November 1992 in L.A."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first= Tom |last= Gliatto |date= August 15, 1994 |title= Neverland Meets Graceland |magazine= [[People (magazine)|People]] |url= http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20103653,00.html |volume= 42 |issue= 7 |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They stayed in contact every day over the telephone. As the child molestation accusations became public, Jackson became dependent on Presley for emotional support; she was concerned about his faltering health and addiction to drugs.&lt;ref name="T51820"&gt;Taraborrelli, 2009, pp. 518520.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=This is the first mention of Jackson being addicted to drugs; it needs more explanation and detail|date=January 2017}} Presley said: "I believed he didn't do anything wrong and that he was wrongly accused and yes I started falling for him.

Jackson proposed to Presley over the telephone towards the fall of 1993, saying: "If I asked you to marry me, would you do it?"&lt;ref name="T51820"/&gt; They married in the [[Dominican Republic]] in secrecy, denying it for nearly two months afterwards.&lt;ref name="Divorce"&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.cnn.com/US/9601/jacko_presley/ |title= She's out of his life |agency= CNN |date= January 18, 1996 |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was, in her words, "a married couple's life ... that was sexually active."&lt;ref&gt;Taraborrelli, 2009, pp. 5624.&lt;/ref&gt; The tabloid media speculated that the wedding was a ploy to prop up Jackson's public image.&lt;ref name="Divorce"/&gt; The marriage ended less than two years later with an amicable divorce settlement.&lt;ref name="T5801"&gt;Taraborrelli, 2009, pp. 5801.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 interview with [[Oprah Winfrey]], Presley said they had spent four more years after the divorce "getting back together and breaking up" until she decided to stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Lisa Marie Presley Opens Up About Michael Jackson |url= http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Lisa-Marie-Presley-Opens-Up-About-Michael-Jackson/print/1 |archivedate= January 20, 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110120062601/http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Lisa-Marie-Presley-Opens-Up-About-Michael-Jackson/print/1 |publisher= Oprah.com |date= October 21, 2010 |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19951997: ''HIStory'', second marriage, and fatherhood===
In June 1995, Jackson released the double album ''[[HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I]]''. The first disc, ''HIStory Begins'', is a 15-track [[greatest hits album]] (later reissued as ''Greatest Hits: HIStory, Volume I'' in 2001); the second disc, ''HIStory Continues'', contains 13 original songs and two cover versions. The album debuted at number one on the charts and has been certified for seven million shipments in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Top 100 Albums |publisher= Recording Industry Association of America |url= https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=top_tallies&amp;ttt=T1A&amp;col=certified_units&amp;ord=desc#search_section |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the best-selling multiple-disc album of all time, with 20 million copies (40 million units) sold worldwide.&lt;ref name="Achievements"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Michael Jackson's best selling studio albums |date= June 26, 2009 |newspaper= The Daily Telegraph |accessdate= June 11, 2015 |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/michael-jackson/5648176/Michael-Jacksons-best-selling-studio-albums.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''HIStory'' received a Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]].&lt;ref name="G4850"&gt;George, 2004, pp. 4850.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first single released from ''HIStory'' was "[[Scream/Childhood]]". "Scream", a duet with Jackson's youngest sister [[Janet Jackson|Janet]], protests the media, particularly its treatment of him during the 1993 child abuse allegations. The single had the highest debut on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 at number five, and received a Grammy nomination for "Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals".&lt;ref name="G4850"/&gt; "[[You Are Not Alone]]" was the second single released from ''HIStory''; it holds the ''Guinness World Record'' for the first song ever to debut at number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart.&lt;ref name="World Records"/&gt; It was seen as a major artistic and commercial success, receiving a Grammy nomination for "Best Pop Vocal Performance".&lt;ref name="G4850"/&gt;

In late 1995, Jackson was rushed to a hospital after collapsing during rehearsals for a televised performance, caused by a stress-related [[panic attack]].&lt;ref&gt;Taraborrelli, 2009, pp. 5767.&lt;/ref&gt; In November, Jackson merged his ATV Music catalog with Sony's music publishing division, creating [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]].

''HIStory'' was promoted with the successful [[HIStory World Tour]], beginning on September 7, 1996, and ending on October 15, 1997. Jackson performed 82 concerts in five continents, 35 countries and 58 cities to over 4.5 million fans, and grossed a total of {{Nowrap|$165 million}}, becoming Jackson's most successful tour in terms of audience figures.&lt;ref name="LJ956"/&gt; During the tour, Jackson married his [[Personal relationships of Michael Jackson#Debbie Rowe|longtime friend]] [[Debbie Rowe|Deborah Jeanne Rowe]], a dermatology nurse, in an impromptu ceremony in Sydney, Australia.

In 1997, Jackson released ''[[Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix]]'', which contained remixes of hit singles from ''HIStory'' and five new songs.

===19972002: Label dispute and ''Invincible''===
From October 1997 to September 2001, Jackson worked with collaborators including Teddy Riley and [[Rodney Jerkins]] to produce what would be his tenth solo album, ''[[Invincible (Michael Jackson album)|Invincible]]''.

The concert took place on October 21, 2001, and included performances from dozens of major artists, including Jackson, who performed his song "[[What More Can I Give]]" as the finale.&lt;ref name="T6147"/&gt; Due to contractual issues related to the earlier 30th Anniversary concerts, later edited into a two-hour TV special titled ''[[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special|Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration]]'' broadcast in November 2001, Jackson's solo performances were omitted from the televised benefit concert, although he could still be seen singing backing vocals.

The release of ''Invincible'' was preceded by a dispute between Jackson and his record label, [[Sony Music Entertainment]]. Jackson had expected the licenses to the masters of his albums to revert to him some time in the early 2000s, after which he would be able to promote the material however he pleased and keep the profits; however, clauses in the contract set the revert date years into the future. Jackson discovered that the attorney who had represented him in the deal had also been representing Sony.&lt;ref name="T6101"/&gt; He was also concerned that for years Sony had been pressuring him to sell his share in its music catalog venture; he feared that Sony might have had a [[conflict of interest]], since if Jackson's career failed, he would have had to sell his share of the catalog at a low price.&lt;ref name="T6147"&gt;Taraborrelli, 2009, pp. 6147.&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson sought an early exit from his contract.&lt;ref name="T6101"/&gt;

''Invincible'' was released on October 30, 2001 to much anticipation. It was Jackson's first full-length album in six years, and the last album of original material he released in his lifetime.&lt;ref name="T6101"/&gt; It debuted at number one in 13 countries and went on to sell approximately 13 million copies worldwide. It received double-platinum certification in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Certifications"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Achievements"/&gt; However, sales for ''Invincible'' were lower than Jackson's previous releases, due in part to the record label dispute and the lack of promotion or tour, and its release at a bad time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|first= David |last= Goldman |title= Music's lost decade: Sales cut in half |agency= CNN Money |date= February 3, 2010 |accessdate= April 6, 2016 |url= http://money.cnn.com/2010/02/02/news/companies/napster_music_industry/}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the music industry in general.&lt;ref name="T6147"/&gt; ''Invincible'' spawned three singles, "[[You Rock My World]]", "[[Cry (Michael Jackson song)|Cry]]", and "[[Butterflies (Michael Jackson song)|Butterflies]]", the latter without a music video.

On January 22, 2002, Jackson won his 22nd American Music Award for Artist of the Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Oc40AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GyEGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5669,889435 |title= Keys, Destiny's Child, McGraw win at American Music Awards |newspaper= Lodi News-Sentinel |agency= Associated Press |date= January 10, 2002 |accessdate= June 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Anchor|PrinceII}}On February 22 of the same year, his third child, Prince Michael Jackson II (nicknamed "Blanket") was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Michael Jackson |newspaper= [[Daily Mirror]] |url= https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/michael%20jackson |accessdate= May 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mother's identity was not announced, but Jackson said Prince was the result of [[artificial insemination]] from a [[surrogacy|surrogate mother]] and his own sperm.&lt;ref name="T599600"/&gt; Jackson alleged in July 2002 that Sony Music chairman [[Tommy Mottola]] was a "devil" and "racist" who did not support his African-American artists, using them merely for his own gain.&lt;ref name="T6147"/&gt; He charged that Mottola had called his colleague [[Irv Gotti]] a "fat [[nigger]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|first= Jermaine |last= Jackson |subjectlink= Jermaine Jackson |interviewer= [[Connie Chung]] |title= Interview with Jermaine Jackson |date= December 31, 2002 |work= [[Connie Chung Tonight]] |url= http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0212/31/cct.00.html |accessdate= July 2, 2008 |publisher= CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony refused to renew Jackson's contract, and claimed that a {{Nowrap|$25 million}} promotional campaign had failed because Jackson refused to tour in the United States.&lt;ref name="Burkeman"/&gt;

Beginning in May 2002, Jackson allowed a documentary film crew, led by British TV personality [[Martin Bashir]], to follow him around nearly everywhere he went. On November 20 of that year, Jackson brought his infant son Prince onto the balcony of his room at the [[Hotel Adlon]] in Berlin as fans stood below, holding him in his right arm with a cloth loosely draped over Prince's face. Prince was briefly extended over a railing, four stories above ground level, prompting widespread criticism in the media. Jackson later apologized for the incident, calling it "a terrible mistake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Jennifer |last= Vineyard |date= November 20, 2002 |url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458799/20021120/jackson_michael.jhtml |title= Michael Jackson Calls Baby-Dangling Incident A 'Terrible Mistake' |publisher= MTV |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bashir's crew was with Jackson during this incident; the program was broadcast in March 2003 as ''[[Living with Michael Jackson]]''. In a particularly controversial scene, Jackson was seen holding hands and discussing sleeping arrangements with a young boy.&lt;ref name="T640"&gt;Taraborrelli, 2009, p. 640.&lt;/ref&gt;

As soon as the documentary aired, the Santa Barbara county attorney's office began a criminal investigation. After an initial probe from the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] and [[Child Protective Services|DCFS]] was conducted in February 2003, they had initially concluded that molestation allegations were "unfounded" at the time.&lt;ref name="SG2003"&gt;{{cite web|title= Early Probe Cleared Michael Jackson |url= http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/early-probe-cleared-michael-jackson |publisher= The Smoking Gun |date= December 9, 2003 |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the young boy involved in the documentary and his mother had told investigators that Jackson had behaved improperly, Jackson was arrested in November 2003 and charged with seven counts of child molestation and two counts of [[Alcoholic beverage#United States of America|administering an intoxicating agent]] in relation to the 13-year-old boy shown in the film.&lt;ref name="T640"/&gt; Jackson denied the allegations, saying the sleepovers were not sexual in nature. The ''[[Trial of Michael Jackson|People v. Jackson]]'' trial began on January 31, 2005, in [[Santa Maria, California]], and lasted until the end of May. On June 13, 2005, Jackson was acquitted on all counts.&lt;ref&gt;Taraborrelli, 2009, p. 661.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Matthews |last= Davis |date= June 6, 2005 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4612897.stm |title= Trial health problems for Jackson |publisher= BBC News Online |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Jackson cleared of child molestation |newspaper= The Guardian |agency= Associated Press |url= https://www.theguardian.com/jackson/story/0,15819,1505806,00.html |date= June 13, 2005 |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the trial, in a highly publicized relocation, he moved to the Persian Gulf island of [[Bahrain]] as a guest of [[Abdullah bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa|Sheikh Abdullah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Habib |last= Toumi |date= January 23, 2006 |url= http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/bahrain/jackson-settles-down-to-his-new-life-in-the-gulf-1.222403 |title= Jackson settles down to his new life in the Gulf |newspaper= [[Gulf News]] |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unknown to Jackson, Bahrain was also where the family had intended to send Jackson if he had been convicted, according to a statement by Jermaine Jackson printed in ''[[The Times]]'' of London in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= https://news.yahoo.com/jermaine-jackson-reveals-escape-plan-michael-112521219.html |title= Jermaine Jackson reveals escape plan for Michael |agency= Associated Press |date= September 10, 2011 |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 17, 2003, three days before Jackson's arrest, Sony released ''[[Number Ones (Michael Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'', a compilation of Jackson's hits on CD and DVD. In the U.S., the album was certified triple platinum by the RIAA; in the UK it was certified six times platinum for shipments of at least 1.2 million units.&lt;ref name="Certifications"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Certified Awards |publisher= [[British Phonographic Industry]] |url= http://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards.aspx |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Michael Jackson 2006.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Jackson and his son Blanket in [[Disneyland Paris]], 2006]]
In March 2006, amidst reports that Jackson was having financial problems, the main house at Neverland Ranch was closed as a cost-cutting measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Jackson Closes Neverland House |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jackson-closes-neverland-house/ |publisher= CBS News |date= July 6, 2009 |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson had been delinquent on his repayments of a $270 million loan secured against his music-publishing holdings, even though the holdings were reportedly making him as much as {{Nowrap|$75 million}} a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title= Really Odd Facts About Michael Jackson |url= https://www.forbes.com/2005/06/14/jackson-celebrity-trial-cx_da_0614topnews.html |magazine= Forbes |date= June 14, 2005 |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bank of America]] sold the debt to [[Fortress Investment Group|Fortress Investments]]. Sony reportedly proposed a restructuring deal which would give them a future option to buy half of Jackson's stake in their jointly-owned publishing company, leaving Jackson with a 25% stake.&lt;ref name="sonydeal"/&gt; Jackson agreed to a Sony-backed refinancing deal in April 2006, although the details were not made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4909412.stm |title= Jackson strikes deal over loans |publisher= BBC News Online |date= April 14, 2006 |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson did not have a recording contract at the time. In early 2006, it was announced that Jackson had signed a contract with a [[Bahrain]]-based startup, Two Seas Records; nothing came of the deal, and Two Seas CEO [[Gut Records|Guy Holmes]] later stated that it had never been finalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/58713/michael-jackson-sails-with-two-seas |title= Michael Jackson Sails With Two Seas |magazine= Billboard |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bahrain"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5380654.stm |title= Jackson parts with Bahrain label |publisher= BBC News Online |date= September 26, 2006 |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 2006, Sony repackaged 20 singles from the 1980s and 1990s as the ''[[Visionary: The Video Singles|Michael Jackson: Visionary]]'' series, which subsequently became a [[box set]]. Most of the singles returned to the charts as a result. In September 2006, Jackson and his ex-wife Debbie Rowe confirmed reports that they had settled their long-running child custody suit. The terms were never made public. Jackson continued to be the custodial parent of the couple's two children.&lt;ref name="Ex wife"/&gt;

In October 2006, [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] entertainment reporter Roger Friedman said that Jackson had been recording at a studio in rural [[County Westmeath|Westmeath, Ireland]]. It was not known at the time what Jackson was working on, or who had paid for the sessions, since his publicist had recently issued a statement claiming that he had left Two Seas.&lt;ref name="Bahrain"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Roger |last= Friedman |date= October 21, 2006 |title= Who's Funding Jackson's Retreat to Irish Recording Studio? |publisher= Fox News Channel |url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,222797,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2006, Jackson invited an ''[[Access Hollywood]]'' camera crew into the studio in Westmeath, and [[MSNBC]] reported that he was working on a new album, produced by [[will.i.am]].&lt;ref name="Achievements"/&gt; Jackson performed at the [[2006 World Music Awards|World Music Awards]] in London on November 15, 2006, and accepted a Diamond Award for selling over {{Nowrap|100 million}} records.&lt;ref name="Achievements"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= 2006 World Music Awards |url= http://www.chiff.com/pop-culture/world-music-awards.htm |archivedate= February 4, 2008 |publisher= Chiff |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080204051554/http://www.chiff.com/pop-culture/world-music-awards.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his period in Ireland he sought Dr. [[Patrick Treacy]] for cosmetic treatment after reading about his experience with HLA fillers and his charitable work in [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Rebecca |last= Maher  |title= Michael Jackson's Irish doctor releases memoir |newspaper= [[Irish Examiner]] |date= October 9, 2015 |accessdate= August 30, 2017 |url= http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/michael-jacksons-irish-doctor-releases-memoir-358363.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treacy became his only doctor when he lived in Ireland in 2006.

In late 2008, Fortress Investments threatened to foreclose on Neverland Ranch, which Jackson used as collateral for loans running into many tens of millions of dollars. However, Fortress opted to sell Jackson's debts to [[Colony Capital|Colony Capital LLC]]. In November, Jackson transferred Neverland Ranch's title to Sycamore Valley Ranch Company LLC, a joint venture between Jackson and Colony Capital LLC.

===Vocal style===
Jackson sang from childhood, and over time his voice and vocal style changed noticeably. Between 1971 and 1975, his voice descended from boy [[soprano]] to high [[tenor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Nathan |last= Brackett |first2= Christian |last2= Hoard |title= [[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]] |publisher= [[Fireside Books|Fireside]] |year= 2004 |isbn= 0-7432-0169-8 |page= 414}}&lt;/ref&gt; His vocal range as an adult was F2-E{{music|flat}}6. Jackson first used the "vocal hiccup" technique, similar to gulping for air or gasping, in 1973, with the song "It's Too Late to Change the Time" from the Jackson 5's album ''[[G.I.T.: Get It Together]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Geoff |last= Brown |title= The Complete Guide to the Music of Michael Jackson &amp; The Jackson Family |publisher= [[Omnibus Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson did not use the technique fully until the recording of ''[[Off the Wall (album)|Off the Wall]]'': it can be seen in full force in the "[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]" promotional video.&lt;ref name="G22"/&gt; With the arrival of ''Off the Wall'' in the late 1970s, Jackson's abilities as a vocalist were well regarded; at the time, ''Rolling Stone'' compared his vocals to the "breathless, dreamy stutter" of Stevie Wonder, and wrote that "Jackson's feathery-timbred tenor is extraordinarily beautiful. It slides smoothly into a startling [[falsetto]] that's used very daringly."&lt;ref name="AMOFW"&gt;{{cite web|first= Stephen Thomas |last= Erlewine |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/off-the-wall-mw0000190332 |title= Michael Jackson  Off the Wall  Overview |publisher= AllMusic.

A distinctive deliberate mispronunciation of "come on", used frequently by Jackson, occasionally spelled "c'mon", "cha'mone", or "shamone", is also a staple in impressions and caricatures of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Rory |last= Lewarne |title= Pink Grease |publisher= Music News |date= July 26, 2004 |url= http://www.music-news.com/ShowReview.asp?nReviewID=363&amp;nType=4 |accessdate= August 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The turn of the 1990s saw the release of the introspective album ''Dangerous''. ''The New York Times'' noted that on some tracks, "he gulps for breath, his voice quivers with anxiety or drops to a desperate whisper, hissing through clenched teeth" and he had a "wretched tone".&lt;ref name="NYT Dangerous"/&gt; When singing of brotherhood or self-esteem the musician would return to "smooth" vocals.&lt;ref name="NYT Dangerous"/&gt; Of ''Invincible'', ''Rolling Stone'' was of the opinion that, at age 43, Jackson still performed "exquisitely voiced rhythm tracks and vibrating vocal harmonies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first= James |last= Hunter |title= Michael Jackson: Invincible |magazine= Rolling Stone |date= December 6, 2001 |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/invincible-20011206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson George wrote: "The grace, the aggression, the growling, the natural boyishness, the falsetto, the smoothnessthat combination of elements mark him as a major vocalist".&lt;ref name="G24"/&gt; Cultural critic [[Joseph Vogel]] notes that Jackson had a "distinctive styles is his ability to convey emotion without the use of language: there are his trademark gulps, grunts, gasps, cries, exclamations; he also frequently scats or twists and contorts words until they are barely discernible."&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, 2012, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil McCormick]] notes that Jackson's unorthodox singing style "was original and utterly distinctive, from his almost ethereal falsetto to his soft, sweet mid-tones; his fluid, seamless control of often very fast moving series of notes; his percussive yet still melodic outbursts, ululations and interjections (from those spooky "tee-hee-hees" to grunts and wails). Unusually for someone coming from a black American soul tradition, he did not often sing straight, unadorned ballads, though when he did (from '[[Ben (song)|Ben]]' to '[[She's Out of My Life]]') the effect was of a powerful simplicity and truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Neil |last= McCormick |authorlink= Neil McCormick |title= Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen &amp; Bono |newspaper= The Daily Telegraph |date= June 30, 2009 |accessdate= February 16, 2016 |url= http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/culture/neilmccormick/100000966/michael-jackson-bruce-springsteen-bono-great-singing-is-about-more-than-the-notes/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19-minute music video for "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]"directed by [[Martin Scorsese]]Jackson began using sexual imagery and choreography not previously seen in his work. He occasionally grabbed or touched his chest, torso and crotch. When asked by Oprah in the 1993 interview about why he grabbed his crotch, he replied, "I think it happens subliminally" and he described it as something that was not planned, but rather, as something that was compelled by the music. "Bad" garnered a mixed reception from both fans and critics; ''Time'' magazine described it as "infamous". The video also featured [[Wesley Snipes]]; in the future Jackson's videos would often feature famous cameo roles.&lt;ref name="T3703"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first= Richard |last= Corliss |authorlink= Richard Corliss |title= Michael Jackson: Who's Bad? |magazine= Time |url= http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979177,00.html |date= September 6, 1993 |accessdate= April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the "[[Smooth Criminal]]" video, Jackson experimented with an anti-gravity lean where the performer leans forward at a 45 degree angle, beyond the performer's center of gravity. To accomplish this move live, Jackson and designers developed a special shoe that locks the performer's feet to the stage, allowing them to lean forward.

==Earnings and wealth==
It is estimated that Michael Jackson earned about $750 million in his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Stress killed MJ, says ex-publicist |url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hollywood/news-interviews/Stress-killed-MJ-says-ex-publicist/articleshow/4709371.cms?referral=PM |newspaper= [[The Times of India]] |date= June 27, 2009 |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales of his recordings through Sony's music unit earned him an estimated $300 million in royalties. He may have also earned an additional $400 million from concerts, music publishing (including his share of the Beatles catalog), endorsements, merchandising and music videos. Estimating how much of these earnings Jackson was able to personally pocket is difficult because one has to account for taxes, recording costs and production costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Timothy L |last= O'Brien |title= What Happened to the Fortune Michael Jackson Made? |newspaper= The New York Times |page= 1 |date= May 14, 2006 |accessdate= March 16, 2013 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/business/yourmoney/14michael.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been several detailed estimates of Jackson's net worth during his life, which range from negative $285 million to positive $350 million for the years 2002, 2003 and 2007.

===Net worth at time of death; U.S. federal estate tax problems===
On July 26, 2013, the executors of the Estate of Michael Jackson filed a petition in the [[United States Tax Court]] as a result of a dispute with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) over [[Estate tax in the United States|U.S. federal estate taxes]] imposed on the value of Jackson's Estate at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Estate of Michael J.

The IRS asserts that the Estate was worth over $1.1 billion, and that over $700 million in federal estate taxes (including penalties) are due.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb"/&gt; A trial was held from February 6 to 24, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= United States Tax Court: Washington, DC 20217 |date= February 2, 2016 |url= https://www.ustaxcourt.gov/UstcDockInq/DocumentViewer.aspx?IndexID=6774879}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of early July 2017, no decision has been rendered.

In 2016, Forbes magazine estimated annual gross earnings by the Jackson Estate at $825 million, the largest ever recorded for a celebrity. The majority was due to the sale of the Sony/ATV catalog. It marked the seventh consecutive year since his death where Jackson's annual earnings were over $100 million.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;
