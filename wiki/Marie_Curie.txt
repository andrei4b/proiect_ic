She was the [[List of female Nobel laureates|first woman]] to win a [[Nobel Prize]], the first person and only woman to [[Nobel Prize#Multiple laureates|win twice]], the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two different sciences, and was part of the [[Nobel Prize#Family laureates|Curie family legacy]] of five Nobel Prizes. She was also the first woman to become a professor at the [[University of Paris]], and in 1995 became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the [[Panthon]] in Paris.

She was born in [[Warsaw]], in what was then the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], part of the [[Russian Empire]]. She studied at Warsaw's clandestine [[Flying University]] and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw. In 1891, aged 24, she followed her older sister [[Bronisawa Duska|Bronisawa]] to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent scientific work. She shared the 1903 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] with her husband [[Pierre Curie]] and with physicist [[Henri Becquerel]]. She won the 1911 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].

Her achievements included the development of the theory of ''radioactivity'' (a term that she coined&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www2.lbl.gov/abc/wallchart/chapters/03/4.html|title = The Discovery of Radioactivity|date = |accessdate = |website = [[Berkeley Lab]]|publisher = |last = |first = |quote = The term radioactivity was actually coined by Marie Curie [].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.aip.org/history/curie/resbr1.htm|title = Marie Curie  Research Breakthroughs (18971904)|date = |accessdate = |website = [[American Institute of Physics]]|publisher = |last = |first = |quote = To describe the behavior of uranium and thorium [Curie] invented the word radioactivity --based on the Latin word for ray.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.nobelprize.org/educational/nobelprize_info/curie-edu.html|title = Marie Curie and the radioactivity, The 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics|date = |accessdate = |website = nobelprize.org|publisher = |last = |first = |quote = Marie called this radiation radioactivity - "radio" means radiation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), techniques for isolating radioactive [[isotope]]s, and the discovery of two elements, [[polonium]] and [[radium]]. Under her direction, the world's first studies into the treatment of [[neoplasm]]s were conducted using radioactive isotopes. She founded the [[Curie Institute (Paris)|Curie Institutes in Paris]] and [[Curie Institute (Warsaw)|in Warsaw]], which remain major centres of medical research today. During [[World War I]], she developed mobile radiography units to provide [[X-ray]] services to [[field hospital]]s.

Marie Curie died in 1934, aged 66, at a [[sanatorium]] in [[Sancellemoz]] ([[Haute-Savoie]]), France, of [[aplastic anemia]] from exposure to radiation in the course of her scientific research and in the course of her radiological work at field hospitals during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Zz7Q-zZ4onc|"The Genius of Marie Curie: The Woman Who Lit Up the World"}} (a 2013 [[BBC]] documentary).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Early years===
[[File:Sklodowski Family Wladyslaw and his daughters Maria Bronislawa Helena.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Wadysaw Skodowski with daughters ''(from left)'' Maria, [[Bronisawa Duska|Bronisawa]], [[:pl:Helena Skodowska-Szaley|Helena]], 1890]]
Maria Skodowska was born in [[Warsaw]], in [[Congress Poland]] in the [[Russian Empire]], on 7 November 1867, the fifth and youngest child of well-known teachers Bronisawa, ''ne'' Boguska, and Wadysaw Skodowski.&lt;ref name="psb111" /&gt; The elder siblings of Maria ([[nickname]]d ''Mania'') were Zofia (born 1862, nicknamed ''Zosia''), [[:pl:Jzef Skodowski (lekarz)|Jzef]] (born 1863, nicknamed ''Jzio''), [[Bronisawa Duska|Bronisawa]] (born 1865, nicknamed ''Bronia'') and [[:pl:Helena Skodowska-Szaley|Helena]] (born 1866, nicknamed ''Hela'').&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Polish Girlhood (18671891)"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Age of Radiance: The Epic Rise and Dramatic Fall of the Atomic Era|last=Nelson|first=Craig|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2014|isbn=1-4516-6045-6|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vTcGAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=bronislawa%20bronya&amp;pg=PA18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On both the paternal and maternal sides, the family had lost their property and fortunes through patriotic involvements in Polish national uprisings aimed at restoring Poland's independence (the most recent had been the [[January Uprising]] of 186365).&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt; This condemned the subsequent generation, including Maria and her elder siblings, to a difficult struggle to get ahead in life.&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt; Maria's paternal grandfather, [[:pl:Jzef Skodowski|Jzef Skodowski]], had been a respected teacher in [[Lublin]], where he taught the young [[Bolesaw Prus#Early years|Bolesaw Prus]],&lt;ref name="robert1"/&gt; who would become a leading figure in Polish literature.&lt;ref name="undoubtedly"/&gt;

Wadysaw Skodowski taught mathematics and physics, subjects that Maria was to pursue, and was also director of two Warsaw ''[[gymnasium (school)|gymnasia]]'' for boys. After Russian authorities eliminated laboratory instruction from the Polish schools, he brought much of the laboratory equipment home, and instructed his children in its use.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Polish Girlhood (18671891)"/&gt; He was eventually fired by his Russian supervisors for pro-Polish sentiments, and forced to take lower-paying posts; the family also lost money on a bad investment, and eventually chose to supplement their income by lodging boys in the house.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Polish Girlhood (18671891)" /&gt; Maria's mother Bronisawa operated a prestigious Warsaw boarding school for girls; she resigned from the position after Maria was born.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Polish Girlhood (18671891)" /&gt; She died of [[tuberculosis]] in May 1878, when Maria was ten years old.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Polish Girlhood (18671891)" /&gt; Less than three years earlier, Maria's oldest sibling, Zofia, had died of [[typhus]] contracted from a boarder.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Polish Girlhood (18671891)" /&gt; Maria's father was an [[atheist]]; her mother a devout Catholic.&lt;ref name="Barker2011" /&gt; The deaths of Maria's mother and sister caused her to give up Catholicism and become [[agnostic]].&lt;ref name="Marie Curie" /&gt;

When she was ten years old, Maria began attending the boarding school of J. Sikorska; next she attended a ''[[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'' for girls, from which she graduated on 12 June 1883 with a gold medal.&lt;ref name="psb111" /&gt; After a collapse, possibly due to [[Depression (mood)|depression]],&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Polish Girlhood (18671891)" /&gt; she spent the following year in the countryside with relatives of her father, and the next year with her father in Warsaw, where she did some tutoring.&lt;ref name="psb111" /&gt; Unable to enroll in a regular institution of higher education because she was a woman, she and her sister Bronisawa became involved with the clandestine [[Flying University]] (sometimes translated as ''Floating University''), a Polish patriotic institution of higher learning that admitted women students.&lt;ref name="psb111" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Polish Girlhood (18671891)" /&gt;
[[File:Maria Sklodowska et sa sur Bronislawa en 1886.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Maria Skodowska (left) with sister [[Bronisawa Duska|Bronisawa]], ca. 1886]]
Maria made an agreement with her sister, Bronisawa, that she would give her financial assistance during Bronisawa's medical studies in Paris, in exchange for similar assistance two years later.&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Polish Girlhood (18671891)1"/&gt; In connection with this, Maria took a position as [[governess]]: first as a home tutor in Warsaw; then for two years as a governess in [[Szczuki, Masovian Voivodeship|Szczuki]] with a landed family, the orawskis, who were relatives of her father.&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Polish Girlhood (18671891)1"/&gt; While working for the latter family, she fell in love with their son, [[Kazimierz orawski]], a future eminent mathematician.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Polish Girlhood (18671891)1"/&gt; His parents rejected the idea of his marrying the penniless relative, and Kazimierz was unable to oppose them.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Polish Girlhood (18671891)1"/&gt; Maria's loss of the relationship with orawski was tragic for both. He soon earned a doctorate and pursued an academic career as a mathematician, becoming a professor and [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of [[Jagiellonian University|Krakw University]]. Still, as an old man and a mathematics professor at the [[Warsaw Polytechnic]], he would sit contemplatively before the statue of Maria Skodowska which had been erected in 1935 before the [[Curie Institute, Warsaw|Radium Institute]] that she had founded in 1932.&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt;&lt;ref name="robert2"/&gt;

At the beginning of 1890, Bronisawa  who a few months earlier had married [[Kazimierz Duski]], a Polish physician and social and political activist  invited Maria to join them in Paris. Maria declined because she could not afford the university tuition; it would take her a year and a half longer to gather the necessary funds.&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt; She was helped by her father, who was able to secure a more lucrative position again.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Polish Girlhood (18671891)1"/&gt; All that time she continued to [[Autodidacticism|educate herself]], reading books, exchanging letters, and being tutored herself.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Polish Girlhood (18671891)1"/&gt; In early 1889 she returned home to her father in Warsaw.&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt; She continued working as a governess, and remained there till late 1891.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Polish Girlhood (18671891)1"/&gt; She tutored, studied at the Flying University, and began her practical scientific training (189091) in a chemical laboratory at the [[Museum of Industry and Agriculture]] at ''[[Krakowskie Przedmiecie]] 66'', near [[Warsaw Old Town|Warsaw's Old Town]].&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Polish Girlhood (18671891)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Polish Girlhood (18671891)1"/&gt; The laboratory was run by her cousin [[Jzef Boguski]], who had been an assistant in [[Saint Petersburg]] to the Russian chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]].&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Polish Girlhood (18671891)1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="teachers"/&gt;

===New life in Paris===
In late 1891, she left Poland for France.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt; In Paris, Maria (or Marie, as she would be known in France) briefly found shelter with her sister and brother-in-law before renting a [[garret]] closer to the university, in the [[Latin Quarter]], and proceeding with her studies of physics, chemistry, and mathematics at the [[University of Paris]], where she enrolled in late 1891.&lt;ref name="robert3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Student in Paris"/&gt; She subsisted on her meager resources, suffering from cold winters and occasionally fainting from hunger.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Student in Paris"/&gt;

Skodowska studied during the day and tutored evenings, barely earning her keep. In 1893, she was awarded a degree in physics and began work in an industrial laboratory of Professor [[Gabriel Lippmann]]. Meanwhile, she continued studying at the University of Paris, and with the aid of a fellowship she was able to earn a second degree in 1894.&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Student in Paris"/&gt;{{efn|Sources vary concerning the field of her second degree. [[Tadeusz Estreicher]], in the 1938 ''[[Polski sownik biograficzny]]'' entry, writes that, while many sources state she earned a degree in mathematics, this is incorrect, and that her second degree was in chemistry.&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt;}}

Skodowska had begun her scientific career in Paris with an investigation of the magnetic properties of various steels, commissioned by the [[Society for the Encouragement of National Industry]] (''Socit d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale'' [http://www.industrienationale.fr/]).&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Student in Paris" /&gt; That same year [[Pierre Curie]] entered her life; it was their mutual interest in natural sciences that drew them together.&lt;ref name="Williams331" /&gt; Pierre Curie was an instructor at the School of Physics and Chemistry, the ''[[cole suprieure de physique et de chimie industrielles de la ville de Paris]]'' (ESPCI).&lt;ref name="psb111" /&gt; They were introduced by the Polish physicist, Professor [[Jzef Wierusz-Kowalski]], who had learned that she was looking for a larger laboratory space, something that Wierusz-Kowalski thought Pierre Curie had access to.&lt;ref name="psb111" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Student in Paris" /&gt; Though Curie did not have a large laboratory, he was able to find some space for Skodowska where she was able to begin work.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Student in Paris" /&gt;

Their mutual passion for science brought them increasingly closer, and they began to develop feelings for one another.&lt;ref name="psb111" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Student in Paris" /&gt; Eventually Pierre Curie proposed marriage, but at first Skodowska did not accept as she was still planning to go back to her native country. Curie, however, declared that he was ready to move with her to Poland, even if it meant being reduced to teaching French.&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt; Meanwhile, for the 1894 summer break, Skodowska returned to Warsaw, where she visited her family.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Student in Paris"/&gt; She was still laboring under the illusion that she would be able to work in her chosen field in Poland, but she was denied a place at [[Jagiellonian University|Krakw University]] [[Sexism in academia|because she was a woman]].&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt; A letter from Pierre Curie convinced her to return to Paris to pursue a [[Ph.D]].&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Student in Paris"/&gt; At Skodowska's insistence, Curie had written up his research on [[magnetism]] and received his own doctorate in March 1895; he was also promoted to professor at the School.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Student in Paris"/&gt; A contemporary quip would call Skodowska, "Pierre's biggest discovery."&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt; On 26 July 1895 they were married in [[Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine|Sceaux]] ([[Seine (department)|Seine]]);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://janinetissot.fdaf.org/jt_curie_marie.htm|title=Marie Curie|author=les Actus DN|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; neither wanted a religious service.&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Student in Paris"/&gt; Curie's dark blue outfit, worn instead of a bridal gown, would serve her for many years as a laboratory outfit.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Student in Paris"/&gt; They shared two pastimes:  long bicycle trips, and journeys abroad, which brought them even closer. In Pierre, Marie had found a new love, a partner, and a scientific collaborator on whom she could depend.&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt;

=== New elements ===
[[File:Pierre and Marie Curie.jpg|thumb|[[Pierre Curie|Pierre]] and Marie Curie in the laboratory]]
In 1895, [[Wilhelm Roentgen]] discovered the existence of [[X-ray]]s, though the mechanism behind their production was not yet understood.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity"/&gt; In 1896, [[Henri Becquerel]] discovered that [[uranium]] salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating power.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity"/&gt; He demonstrated that this radiation, unlike [[phosphorescence]], did not depend on an external source of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itself. Influenced by these two important discoveries, Curie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity"/&gt;

She used an innovative technique to investigate samples.  Fifteen years earlier, her husband and his brother had developed a version of the [[electrometer]], a sensitive device for measuring electric charge.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity"/&gt; Using her husband's electrometer, she discovered that uranium rays caused the air around a sample to conduct electricity. Using this technique, her first result was the finding that the activity of the uranium compounds depended only on the quantity of uranium present.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity"/&gt; She [[hypothesis|hypothesized]] that the radiation was not the outcome of some interaction of [[molecule]]s but must come from the [[atom]] itself.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity"/&gt; This hypothesis was an important step in disproving the ancient assumption that atoms were indivisible.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity"/&gt;&lt;ref name="robert4"/&gt;

In 1897, her daughter [[Irne Joliot-Curie|Irne]] was born. To support her family, Curie began teaching at the [[cole Normale Suprieure]].&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt; The Curies did not have a dedicated laboratory; most of their research was carried out in a converted shed next to the School of Physics and Chemistry.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt; The shed, formerly a medical school dissecting room, was poorly ventilated and not even waterproof.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2"/&gt; They were unaware of the deleterious effects of [[Radioactive contamination|radiation exposure]] attendant on their continued unprotected work with radioactive substances. The School did not sponsor her research, but she would receive subsidies from metallurgical and mining companies and from various organizations and governments.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Student in Paris 2"/&gt;

Curie's systematic studies included two uranium minerals, [[pitchblende]] and [[torbernite]] (also known as chalcolite).&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2"/&gt; Her electrometer showed that pitchblende was four times as active as uranium itself, and chalcolite twice as active. She concluded that, if her earlier results relating the quantity of uranium to its activity were correct, then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another substance that was far more active than uranium.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="robert5"/&gt; She began a systematic search for additional substances that emit radiation, and by 1898 she discovered that the element [[thorium]] was also radioactive.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity"/&gt; Pierre Curie was increasingly intrigued by her work. By mid-1898 he was so invested in it that he decided to drop his work on crystals and to join her.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2"/&gt;

{{blockquote|The [research] idea [writes Reid] was her own; no one helped her formulate it, and although she took it to her husband for his opinion she clearly established her ownership of it. She later recorded the fact twice in her biography of her husband to ensure there was no chance whatever of any ambiguity. It [is] likely that already at this early stage of her career [she] realized that... many scientists would find it difficult to believe that a woman could be capable of the original work in which she was involved.&lt;ref name="robert6"/&gt;}}

She was acutely aware of the importance of promptly publishing her discoveries and thus establishing her [[scientific priority|priority]]. Had not Becquerel, two years earlier, presented his discovery to the ''[[Acadmie des Sciences]]'' the day after he made it, credit for the discovery of radioactivity, and even a Nobel Prize, would instead have gone to [[Silvanus Thompson]]. Curie chose the same rapid means of publication. Her paper, giving a brief and simple account of her work, was presented for her to the ''Acadmie'' on 12 April 1898 by her former professor, [[Gabriel Lippmann]].&lt;ref name="robert7"/&gt; Even so, just as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel, so Curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the same way as uranium; two months earlier, [[Gerhard Carl Schmidt]] had published his own finding in Berlin.&lt;ref name="Robert Reid p. 65"/&gt;

At that time, no one else in the world of physics had noticed what Curie recorded in a sentence of her paper, describing how much greater were the activities of pitchblende and chalcolite than uranium itself: "The fact is very remarkable, and leads to the belief that these minerals may contain an element which is much more active than uranium." She later would recall how she felt "a passionate desire to verify this hypothesis as rapidly as possible."&lt;ref name="Robert Reid p. 65"/&gt; On 14 April 1898, the Curies optimistically weighed out a 100-gram sample of pitchblende and ground it with a pestle and mortar. They did not realize at the time that what they were searching for was present in such minute quantities that they would eventually have to process tons of the ore.&lt;ref name="Robert Reid p. 65"/&gt;

In July 1898, Curie and her husband published a joint paper announcing the existence of an element which they named "[[polonium]]", in honour of her native Poland, which would for another twenty years remain [[partitions of Poland|partitioned among three empires]] ([[Russian Empire|Russian]], [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]], and [[German Empire|Prussian]]).&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt; On 26 December 1898, the Curies announced the existence of a second element, which they named "[[radium]]", from the [[Latin]] word for "ray".&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Discovery of Radioactivity"/&gt; In the course of their research, they also coined the word "[[radioactivity]]".&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt;

To prove their discoveries beyond any doubt, the Curies sought to isolate polonium and radium in pure form.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2"/&gt; Pitchblende is a complex mineral; the chemical separation of its constituents was an arduous task. The discovery of polonium had been relatively easy; chemically it resembles the element [[bismuth]], and polonium was the only bismuth-like substance in the ore.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2"/&gt; Radium, however, was more elusive; it is closely related chemically to [[barium]], and pitchblende contains both elements. By 1898 the Curies had obtained traces of radium, but appreciable quantities, uncontaminated with barium, were still beyond reach.&lt;ref name="williams"/&gt; The Curies undertook the arduous task of separating out radium salt by differential [[crystallization]]. From a ton of pitchblende, one-tenth of a gram of [[radium chloride]] was separated in 1902. In 1910, she isolated pure radium metal.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams332"/&gt; She never succeeded in isolating polonium, which has a [[half-life]] of only 138 days.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2"/&gt;

Between 1898 and 1902, the Curies published, jointly or separately, a total of 32 scientific papers, including one that announced that, when exposed to [[radium]], diseased, [[tumor]]-forming cells were destroyed faster than healthy cells.&lt;ref&gt;"Marie Sklodowska Curie", ''[[Encyclopedia of World Biography]]'', 2nd ed., vol. 4, Detroit, Gale, 2004, pp. 33941.

In 1900, Curie became the first woman faculty member at the cole Normale Suprieure, and her husband joined the faculty of the University of Paris.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quinn1996"/&gt; In 1902 she visited Poland on the occasion of her father's death.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt;

===Nobel Prizes===
[[File:Marie Curie 1903.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1903 [[Nobel Prize]] portrait]]
In December 1903, the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] awarded Pierre Curie, Marie Curie, and Henri Becquerel the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], "in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the [[ionizing radiation|radiation]] phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel."&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt; At first, the Committee intended to honour only Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, but one of the committee members and an advocate of women scientists, Swedish mathematician [[Magnus Goesta Mittag-Leffler]], alerted her husband Pierre to the situation, and after his complaint, Curie's name was added to the nomination.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Rec and Dis2" /&gt; Marie Curie was the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize.&lt;ref name="psb112" /&gt;

Curie and her husband declined to go to [[Stockholm]] to receive the prize in person; they were too busy with their work, and Pierre Curie, who disliked public ceremonies, was feeling increasingly ill.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Rec and Dis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Rec and Dis2" /&gt; As Nobel laureates were required to deliver a lecture, the Curies finally undertook the trip in 1905.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Rec and Dis2" /&gt; The award money allowed the Curies to hire their first laboratory assistant.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Rec and Dis2" /&gt; Following the award of the Nobel Prize, and galvanized by an offer from the [[University of Geneva]], which offered Pierre Curie a position, the University of Paris gave him a professorship and the chair of physics, although the Curies still did not have a proper laboratory.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quinn1996"/&gt; Upon Pierre Curie's complaint, the University of Paris relented and agreed to furnish a new laboratory, but it would not be ready until 1906.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Rec and Dis2"/&gt;

In December 1904, Curie gave birth to their second daughter, [[ve Curie|ve]].&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Rec and Dis2"/&gt; She hired Polish governesses to teach her daughters her native language, and sent or took them on visits to Poland.&lt;ref name="goldsmith"/&gt;

On 19 April 1906, Pierre Curie was killed in a road accident. Walking across the [[Rue Dauphine]] in heavy rain, he was struck by a [[horse-drawn vehicle]] and fell under its wheels, causing his skull to fracture.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Curie was devastated by her husband's death.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Tr and Ad"/&gt; On 13 May 1906 the  physics department of the University of Paris decided to retain the chair that had been created for her late husband and to offer it to Marie. She accepted it, hoping to create a world-class laboratory as a tribute to her husband Pierre.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Tr and Ad"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Tr and Ad2"/&gt; She was the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt;

Curie's quest to create a new laboratory did not end with the University of Paris, however. In her later years, she headed the Radium Institute (''Institut du radium'', now [[Curie Institute (Paris)|Curie Institute]], ''Institut Curie''), a radioactivity laboratory created for her by the [[Pasteur Institute]] and the [[University of Paris]].&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Tr and Ad2" /&gt; The initiative for creating the Radium Institute had come in 1909 from [[Pierre Paul mile Roux]], director of the Pasteur Institute, who had been disappointed that the University of Paris was not giving Curie a proper laboratory and had suggested that she move to the Pasteur Institute.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb113"/&gt; Only then, with the threat of Curie leaving, did the University of Paris relent, and eventually the Curie Pavilion became a joint initiative of the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute.&lt;ref name="psb113"/&gt;
[[File:1911 Solvay conference.jpg|thumb|right|At First [[Solvay Conference]] (1911), Curie (seated, second from right) confers with [[Henri Poincar]]; standing, fourth from right, is [[Ernest Rutherford|Rutherford]]; second from right, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]; far right, [[Paul Langevin]]]]
In 1910, Curie succeeded in isolating radium; she also defined an international standard for radioactive emissions that was eventually named for her and Pierre: the [[curie]].&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Tr and Ad2"/&gt; Nevertheless, in 1911 the [[French Academy of Sciences]] did not elect her to be a member by one&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt; or two votes.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Sc and Rec"/&gt; Elected instead was [[douard Branly]], an inventor who had helped [[Guglielmo Marconi]] develop the [[wireless telegraph]].&lt;ref name="goldsmith9"/&gt;

A doctoral student of Curie, [[Marguerite Perey]], became the first woman elected to membership in the Academy&amp;nbsp; over half a century later, in 1962. Despite Curie's fame as a scientist working for France, the public's attitude tended toward [[xenophobia]]the same that had led to the [[Dreyfus affair]]which also fueled false speculation that Curie was Jewish.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Sc and Rec"/&gt; During the French Academy of Sciences elections, she was vilified by the right wing press who criticised her for being a foreigner and an atheist.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Sc and Rec"/&gt; Her daughter later remarked on the public hypocrisy as the French press often portrayed Curie as an unworthy foreigner when she was nominated for a French honour, but would portray her as a French hero when she received a foreign one such as her Nobel Prizes.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt;

In 1911, it was revealed that in 191011 Curie had conducted an affair of about a year's duration with physicist [[Paul Langevin]], a former student of Pierre Curie's&lt;ref name="robert10"/&gt;a married man who was estranged from his wife.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Sc and Rec"/&gt; This resulted in a press scandal that was exploited by her academic opponents. Curie (then in her mid-40s) was five years older than Langevin and was misrepresented in the tabloids as a foreign Jewish home-wrecker.&lt;ref name="goldsmith11"/&gt; When the scandal broke, she was away at a conference in Belgium; on her return, she found an angry mob in front of her house and had to seek refuge, with her daughters, in the home of her friend, [[Camille Marbo]].&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Sc and Rec"/&gt;
[[File:Marie Skodowska-Curie's Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1911.jpg|thumb|1911 Nobel Prize diploma]]
International recognition for her work had been growing to new heights, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, overcoming opposition prompted by the Langevin scandal, honored her a second time, with the 1911 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt; This award was "in recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element."&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Sc and Rec2"/&gt; She was the first person to win or share two Nobel Prizes, and remains [[Linus Pauling#Nobels|alone with Linus Pauling as Nobel laureates in two fields each]]. A delegation of celebrated Polish men of learning, headed by novelist [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]], encouraged her to return to Poland and continue her research in her native country.&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt; Curie's second Nobel Prize enabled her to persuade the French government into supporting the Radium Institute, built in 1914, where research was conducted in chemistry, physics, and medicine.&lt;ref name="psb113"/&gt; A month after accepting her 1911 Nobel Prize, she was hospitalised with depression and a kidney ailment. For most of 1912 she avoided public life but did spend time in England with her friend and fellow physicist, [[Hertha Ayrton]]. She returned to her laboratory only in December, after a break of about 14 months.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Sc and Rec2"/&gt;

In 1912, the [[Warsaw Scientific Society]] offered her the directorship of a new laboratory in Warsaw but she declined, focusing on the developing Radium Institute to be completed in August 1914, and on a new street named Rue Pierre-Curie.&lt;ref name="psb113"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Sc and Rec2"/&gt; She was appointed Director of the Curie Laboratory in the Radium Institute of the University of Paris, founded in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1903/marie-curie-bio.html|title=Marie Curie-biographical|last=|first=|date=2014|website=Nobel Prize.org|access-date=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She visited Poland in 1913 and was welcomed in Warsaw but the visit was mostly ignored by the Russian authorities. The Institute's development was interrupted by the coming war, as most researchers were drafted into the [[French Army]], and it fully resumed its activities in 1919.&lt;ref name="psb113"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie Sc and Rec2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie War"/&gt;

===World War I===
[[File:Marie Curie - Mobile X-Ray-Unit.jpg|thumb|Curie in a mobile X-ray vehicle]]
During World War I, Curie recognised that wounded soldiers were best served if operated upon as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="Coppes-Zantinga, A. R 1998"&gt;Coppes-Zantinga, A. R. and Coppes, M. J.

In 1915, Curie produced hollow needles containing "radium emanation", a colorless, radioactive gas given off by radium, later identified as [[radon]], to be used for sterilizing infected tissue. She provided the radium from her own one-gram supply.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie War2"/&gt; It is estimated that over a million wounded soldiers were treated with her X-ray units.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb113"/&gt; Busy with this work, she carried out very little scientific research during that period.&lt;ref name="psb113"/&gt; In spite of all her humanitarian contributions to the French war effort, Curie never received any formal recognition of it from the French government.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie War"/&gt;

Also, promptly after the war started, she attempted to donate her gold Nobel Prize medals to the war effort but the [[Banque de France|French National Bank]] refused to accept them.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie War2"/&gt;  She did buy [[war bonds]], using her Nobel Prize money.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie War2"/&gt; She said:&lt;blockquote&gt;I am going to give up the little gold I possess.  I shall add to this the scientific medals, which are quite useless to me. There is something else: by sheer laziness I had allowed the money for my second Nobel Prize to remain in Stockholm in Swedish crowns. This is the chief part of what we possess. I should like to bring it back here and invest it in war loans. The state needs it. Only, I have no illusions: this money will probably be lost.&lt;ref name="Coppes-Zantinga, A. R 1998" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;She was also an active member in committees of [[Poles in France|Polonia in France]] dedicated to the Polish cause.&lt;ref name="emigracja" /&gt; After the war, she summarized her wartime experiences in a book, ''Radiology in War'' (1919).&lt;ref name="Marie Curie War2" /&gt;

===Postwar years===
In 1920, for the 25th anniversary of the discovery of radium, the French government established a stipend for her; its previous recipient was [[Louis Pasteur]] (182295).&lt;ref name="psb113"/&gt; In 1921, she was welcomed triumphantly when she toured the United States to raise funds for research on radium. [[Marie Mattingly Meloney|Mrs. William Brown Meloney]], after interviewing Curie, created a ''Marie Curie Radium Fund'' and raised money to buy radium, publicising her trip.&lt;ref name="psb113"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Sklodowska Curie in America, 1921"/&gt;

In 1921, U.S. President [[Warren G. Harding]] received her at the White House to present her with the 1&amp;nbsp;gram of radium collected in the United States.&lt;ref name="Madame Curie's Passion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Radium Institute"/&gt; Before the meeting, recognising her growing fame abroad, and embarrassed by the fact that she had no French official distinctions to wear in public, the French government offered her a [[Legion of Honour]] award, but she refused.&lt;ref name="The Radium Institute"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pasachoff1996"/&gt; In 1922 she became a fellow of the [[French Academy of Medicine]].&lt;ref name="psb113"/&gt; She also travelled to other countries, appearing publicly and giving lectures in Belgium, Brazil, Spain, and Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name=amudeu/&gt;

Led by Curie, the Institute produced four more Nobel Prize winners, including her daughter [[Irne Joliot-Curie]] and her son-in-law, [[Frdric Joliot-Curie]].&lt;ref name="The Radium Institute 2" /&gt; Eventually, it became one of four major radioactivity research laboratories, the others being the [[Cavendish Laboratory]], with [[Ernest Rutherford]]; the [[Institute for Radium Research, Vienna]], with [[Stefan Meyer (physicist)|Stefan Meyer]]; and the [[Max Planck Institute for Chemistry|Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry]], with [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Lise Meitner]].&lt;ref name="The Radium Institute 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chemistry International&amp;nbsp; Newsmagazine for IUPAC"/&gt;

In August 1922, Marie Curie became a member of the newly created [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]] of the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = | issue = 2| last = Grandjean| first = Martin| title = Analisi e visualizzazioni delle reti in storia.

===Death===

Curie visited Poland for the last time in early 1934.&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Radium Institute 3"/&gt; A few months later, on 4 July 1934, she died at the [[Sancellemoz]] sanatorium in [[Passy, Haute-Savoie]], from [[aplastic anemia]] believed to have been contracted from her long-term exposure to radiation.&lt;ref name="psb113"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iuniverse"/&gt;

The damaging effects of ionising radiation were not known at the time of her work, which had been carried out without the safety measures later developed.&lt;ref name="The Radium Institute 3"/&gt; She had carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket,&lt;ref name="ShipmanWilson2012"/&gt; and she stored them in her desk drawer, remarking on the [[Radioluminescence|faint light]] that the substances gave off in the dark.&lt;ref name="The Vertigo Years: Europe, 19001914"/&gt; Curie was also exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during the war.&lt;ref name="Marie Curie War2"/&gt; Although her many decades of exposure to radiation caused chronic illnesses (including near-blindness due to [[cataract]]s) and ultimately her death, she never really acknowledged the health risks of radiation exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Denise Grady (6 October 1998), [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/06/science/a-glow-in-the-dark-and-a-lesson-in-scientific-peril.html A Glow in the Dark, and a Lesson in Scientific Peril] ''[[The New York Times]]''; accessed 21 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was interred at the cemetery in [[Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine|Sceaux]], alongside her husband Pierre.&lt;ref name="psb113"/&gt; Sixty years later, in 1995, in honour of their achievements, the remains of both were transferred to the [[Panthon, Paris]]. She became the first woman to be honoured with interment in the Panthon on her own merits.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; In 2015, two other women were also interred on their own merits.&lt;ref&gt;Angelique Chrisafis (27 May 2015), [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/27/french-president-hollande-honours-female-resistance-heroes-in-pantheon France president Franois Hollande adds resistance heroines to Panthon] ''[[The Guardian]]''; accessed 21 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their levels of radioactive contamination, her papers from the 1890s are considered too dangerous to handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/marie-curies-100-year-old-notebook-is-still-too-radioac-1615847891|title=Marie Curie's century-old radioactive notebook still requires lead box|first=Adam Clark|last=Estes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even her cookbook is highly radioactive.&lt;ref name="everything"/&gt; Her papers are kept in lead-lined boxes, and those who wish to consult them must wear protective clothing.&lt;ref name="everything"/&gt; In her last year, she worked on a book, ''Radioactivity'', which was published posthumously in 1935.&lt;ref name="The Radium Institute 3"/&gt;

The physical and societal aspects of the Curies' work contributed substantially to shaping the world of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.&lt;ref name="psb114"/&gt; Cornell University professor [[L. Pearce Williams|{{nowrap|L. Pearce}} Williams]] observes:{{blockquote|The result of the Curies' work was epoch-making. Radium's radioactivity was so great that it could not be ignored. It seemed to contradict the principle of the conservation of energy and therefore forced a reconsideration of the foundations of physics. On the experimental level the discovery of radium provided men like Ernest Rutherford with sources of radioactivity with which they could probe the structure of the atom. As a result of Rutherford's experiments with alpha radiation, the nuclear atom was first postulated. In medicine, the radioactivity of radium appeared to offer a means by which cancer could be successfully attacked.&lt;ref name="Williams332"/&gt;}}

If Curie's work helped overturn established ideas in physics and chemistry, it has had an equally profound effect in the societal sphere. To attain her scientific achievements, she had to overcome barriers, in both her native and her adoptive country, that were placed in her way because she was a woman. This aspect of her life and career is highlighted in [[Franoise Giroud]]'s ''Marie Curie: A Life'', which emphasizes Curie's role as a feminist precursor.&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt;

She was known for her honesty and moderate life style.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psb114"/&gt; Having received a small scholarship in 1893, she returned it in 1897 as soon as she began earning her keep.&lt;ref name="psb111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie&amp;nbsp; Student in Paris 2"/&gt; She gave much of her first Nobel Prize money to friends, family, students, and research associates.&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt; In an unusual decision, Curie intentionally refrained from patenting the radium-isolation process, so that the scientific community could do research unhindered.&lt;ref name="robert8"/&gt; She insisted that monetary gifts and awards be given to the scientific institutions she was affiliated with rather than to her.&lt;ref name="psb114"/&gt; She and her husband often refused awards and medals.&lt;ref name="psb112"/&gt; [[Albert Einstein]] reportedly remarked that she was probably the only person who could not be corrupted by fame.&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt;

As one of the most famous women scientists to date, Marie Curie has become an icon in the scientific world and has received tributes from across the globe, even in the realm of [[popular culture|pop culture]].&lt;ref name="Borzendowski2009-36"/&gt; In a 2009 poll carried out by ''[[New Scientist]]'', she was voted the "most inspirational woman in science". Curie received 25.1 per cent of all votes cast, nearly twice as many as second-place [[Rosalind Franklin]] (14.2 per cent).&lt;ref name="Most inspirational woman scientist revealed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie Curie voted greatest female scientist"/&gt;

Poland and France declared 2011 the Year of Marie Curie, and the [[United Nations]] declared that this would be the International Year of Chemistry.&lt;ref name=cosm/&gt; An artistic installation celebrating "Madame Curie" filled the [[Jacobs Gallery]] at [[San Diego]]'s [[Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego|Museum of Contemporary Art]].&lt;ref name="Madame Curie art"/&gt; On 7 November, [[Google]] celebrated the anniversary of her birth with a special [[Google Doodle]].&lt;ref name="Marie Curies 144th Birthday Google Doodle"/&gt; On 10 December, the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] celebrated the centenary of Marie Curie's second [[Nobel prize]] in the presence of [[Princess Madeleine, Duchess of Hlsingland and Gstrikland|Princess Madeleine of Sweden]].&lt;ref name="Princess Madeleine attends celebrations to mark anniversary of Marie Curie's second Nobel Prize"/&gt;

Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel prize, the first person to win two Nobel Prizes, the only woman to win in two fields, and the only person to win in [[Nobel Prize#Multiple laureates|multiple sciences]].&lt;ref name="Nobel Prize Facts"/&gt; Awards that she received include:

In 1995, she became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the [[Panthon, Paris]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; The [[curie]] (symbol '''Ci'''), a unit of radioactivity, is named in honour of her and Pierre Curie (although the commission which agreed on the name never clearly stated whether the standard was named after Pierre, Marie or both of them).&lt;ref name="How the Curie Came to Be"/&gt; The element with atomic number 96 was named [[curium]].&lt;ref name="Curium"/&gt; Three radioactive minerals are also named after the Curies: [[curite]], [[sklodowskite]], and [[cuprosklodowskite]].&lt;ref name="Borzendowski2009-37"/&gt; She received numerous honorary degrees from universities across the world.&lt;ref name="The Radium Institute"/&gt; The [[Marie Skodowska-Curie Actions]] fellowship program of the [[European Union]] for young scientists wishing to work in a foreign country is named after her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marie Curie Actions |url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/documents/documentation/publications/eu-marie-curie-actions-fellowships-innovative-science-becomes-success-publication_en.pdf |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=10 September 2012 |page=5 |year=2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604030857/http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/documents/documentation/publications/eu-marie-curie-actions-fellowships-innovative-science-becomes-success-publication_en.pdf |archivedate=4 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Poland, she had received honorary doctorates from the [[Lww Polytechnic]] (1912),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thebirminghampress.com/2012/07/coventry-professors-honorary-degree-takes-him-in-footsteps-of-marie-curie/ |title=Coventry professors honorary degree takes him in footsteps of Marie Curie |website=Birmingham Press |date=31 July 2012 |accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Pozna University]] (1922), [[Krakw]]'s [[Jagiellonian University]] (1924), and the [[Warsaw Polytechnic]] (1926).&lt;ref name="cosm"/&gt; In 1921, in the U.S., she was awarded membership in the [[Iota Sigma Pi]] women scientists' society.&lt;ref name="Awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iotasigmapi.info/awards/professionalawards.html|title=PROFESSIONAL AWARDS|publisher=Iota Stigma Pi: National Honor Society for Women in Chemistry|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her name is included on the ''[[Monument to the X-ray and Radium Martyrs of All Nations]]'', erected in [[Hamburg]], Germany in 1936.&lt;ref name="MMI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learningradiology.com/museum/humilityhome.html|title=Museum of Modern Imaging|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous locations around the world are named after her. In 2007, [[Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris Mtro)|a metro station in Paris]] was renamed to honour both of the Curies.&lt;ref name="Borzendowski2009-37"/&gt; Polish nuclear research [[Maria reactor|reactor Maria]] is named after her.&lt;ref name="IEA  reaktor Maria"/&gt; The [[7000 Curie]] asteroid is also named after her.&lt;ref name="Borzendowski2009-37"/&gt; A [[KLM]] [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]] (registration PH-KCC) is named in her honour.&lt;ref name="Picture of the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft"/&gt;

Several institutions bear her name, starting with the two Curie institutes  the [[Curie Institute, Warsaw|Maria SkodowskaCurie Institute of Oncology]], in Warsaw; and the ''[[Curie Institute (Paris)|Institut Curie]]'' in Paris. She is the patron of [[Maria Curie-Skodowska University]], in [[Lublin]], founded in 1944; and of [[Pierre and Marie Curie University]] (Paris VI), France's pre-eminent science university. In Britain, [[Marie Curie Cancer Care]] was organized in 1948 to care for the terminally ill.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charity Commission for England and Wales|Charity Commission]]. [https://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/SearchResultHandler.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=207994 Marie Curie (charity), registered charity no. 207994].&lt;/ref&gt;

Two museums are devoted to Marie Curie.  In 1967, the [[Maria Skodowska-Curie Museum]] was established in Warsaw's "[[Warsaw New Town|New Town]]", at her birthplace on ''ulica Freta'' (Freta Street).&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt; Her Paris laboratory is preserved as the [[Muse Curie]], open since 1992.&lt;ref name="curie"/&gt;

Several works of art bear her likeness. In 1935, Michalina Mocicka, wife of Polish President [[Ignacy Mocicki]], unveiled a statue of Marie Curie before Warsaw's Radium Institute. During the 1944 [[Second World War]] [[Warsaw Uprising]] against the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] occupation, the monument was damaged by gunfire; after the war it was decided to leave the bullet marks on the statue and its pedestal.&lt;ref name="gwiazdapolarna"/&gt; In 1955 [[Jozef Mazur]] created a stained glass panel of her, the [[Maria Skodowska-Curie Medallion]], featured in the [[University at Buffalo]] Polish Room.&lt;ref name="buffalo"/&gt;

A number of biographies are devoted to her. In 1938 her daughter, [[ve Curie]], published ''Madame Curie''. In 1987 [[Franoise Giroud]] wrote ''Marie Curie: A Life''. In 2005 [[Barbara Goldsmith]] wrote ''Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie''.&lt;ref name=cosm/&gt; In 2011 [[Lauren Redniss]] published ''Radioactive: Marie and Pierre Curie, a Tale of Love and Fallout''.&lt;ref name="Radioactive: Marie and Pierre Curie, a Tale of Love and Fallout"/&gt;

[[Greer Garson]] and [[Walter Pidgeon]] starred in the 1943 U.S. Oscar-nominated film, ''[[Madame Curie (film)|Madame Curie]]'', based on her life.&lt;ref name="leg"/&gt; More recently, in 1997, a French film about Pierre and Marie Curie was released, ''[[Les Palmes de M. Schutz]]''. It was adapted from a play of the same name. In the film, Marie Curie was played by [[Isabelle Huppert]].&lt;ref name="Les-Palmes-de-M-Schutz  Trailer  Cast  Showtimes  NYTimes.com"/&gt;

Curie is the subject of the play ''False Assumptions'' by [[Lawrence Aronovitch]], in which the ghosts of three other women scientists observe events in her life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ottawasun.com/2013/03/26/mixing-science-with-theatre Mixing Science With Theatre]  Ottawa Sun, March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Curie has also been portrayed by Susan Marie Frontczak in her play ''Manya: The Living History of Marie Curie'', a one-woman show performed in 30 US states and nine countries, by 2014.&lt;ref name="Main, Douglas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/article/science/famous-image-marie-curie-isnt-marie-curie|title=This Famous Image Of Marie Curie Isn't Marie Curie|publisher=Popular Science www.popsci.com|date=7 March 2014|accessdate=15 November 2014|author=Main, Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curie's likeness also has appeared on banknotes, stamps and coins around the world.&lt;ref name="Borzendowski2009-37"/&gt; She was featured on the Polish late-1980s 20,000-''[[zoty]]'' [[banknote]]&lt;ref name="Council1997" /&gt; as well as on the last French 500-[[|franc]] note, before the franc was replaced by the euro.&lt;ref name="Letcher2003"/&gt; Curie themed postage stamps from [[Mali]], the [[Republic of Togo]], [[Zambia]], and the [[Republic of Guinea]] actually show a picture of Susan Marie Frontczak portraying Curie in a 2001 picture by Paul Schroeder.&lt;ref name="Main, Douglas"/&gt;

On the first [[centenary]] of Marie Curie's second Nobel Prize in 2011, an [[allegory|allegorical]] mural was painted on the [[faade]] of her Warsaw [[Maria Skodowska-Curie Museum|birthplace]]. It depicts an infant Maria Skodowska holding a test tube from which emanate the elements that she would discover as an adult: [[polonium]] and [[radium]]. Also in 2011, a new [[Maria Skodowska-Curie Bridge, Warsaw|Warsaw bridge]] over the [[Vistula]] was named in her honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vistal.pl/realizacje/mosty-realizacje/most-marii-curie-sklodowskiej-polska-realizacja/ |title=Most Marii Skodowskiej-Curie, Polska  Vistal Gdynia |website=www.vistal.pl |access-date=2017-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329160957/http://www.vistal.pl/realizacje/mosty-realizacje/most-marii-curie-sklodowskiej-polska-realizacja/ |archivedate=29 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
