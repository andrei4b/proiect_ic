Streep's father Harry was of German and Swiss ancestry. Her father's lineage traces back to [[Loffenau]], Germany, from where her second great-grandfather, Gottfried Streeb, immigrated to the United States, and where one of her ancestors served as mayor (the surname was later changed to "Streep").{{Sfn|Louis Gates Jr.|p=40}} Another line of her father's family was from [[Giswil]], Switzerland.

Streep's mother, whom she has compared in both appearance and manner to Dame [[Judi Dench]],&lt;ref name="Brockes06"/&gt; strongly encouraged her daughter, and instilled confidence in her from a very young age.&lt;ref name="VF"/&gt; Streep has said: "She was a mentor because she said to me, 'Meryl, you're capable. You're so great.' She was saying, 'You can do whatever you put your mind to. If you're lazy, you're not going to get it done. But if you put your mind to it, you can do anything.' And I believed her." Although Streep was naturally more introverted than her mother, at times, when she later needed an injection of confidence in adulthood, she would consult her mother, asking her for advice.&lt;ref name="VF"/&gt;

Streep was raised as a [[Presbyterian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Joy |last=Horowitz |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/17/movies/that-madcap-meryl-really.html |title=That Madcap Meryl.

Although Streep appeared in numerous school plays during her high school years, she was uninterested in serious theater until acting in the play ''[[Miss Julie]]'' at [[Vassar College]] in 1969, in which she gained attention across the campus.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=8}} Vassar drama professor Clinton J. Atkinson noted, "I don't think anyone ever taught Meryl acting. She really taught herself."{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=8}} Streep demonstrated an early ability to mimic accents and to quickly memorize her lines. She received her [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] ''[[cum laude]]'' from the college in 1971, before applying for an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] from the [[Yale School of Drama]].

One of Meryl Streeps first professional jobs in 1975, after [[Yale]], was at the [[Eugene O'Neill Theater Center]]'s National Playwrights Conference during which she acted in five plays over six weeks. Streep moved to New York City in 1975, and was cast by [[Joseph Papp]] in a production of ''[[Trelawny of the Wells]]'' at the Public Theater, opposite [[Mandy Patinkin]] and [[John Lithgow]].{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=10}} She went on to appear in five more roles in her first year in New York, including in Papp's [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] productions of ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' with [[Ral Juli]], and ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' opposite [[Sam Waterston]] and [[John Cazale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry V Joseph Papp Public Theater/New York Shakespeare Festival|url=http://www.lortel.org/LLA_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&amp;id=2928|publisher=[[Lortel Archives]].

Although she had not set out to make her career in film, [[Robert De Niro]]'s performance in ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976) had a profound impact on young Streep, who said to herself, "that's the kind of actor I want to be when I grow up".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=10}} Streep began auditioning for film roles, and underwent an unsuccessful audition for the lead role in [[Dino De Laurentiis]]'s ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]''. Laurentiis stated in Italian to his son: "This is so ugly. Why did you bring me this?"{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=7}} Unknown to Laurentiis, Streep understood Italian, and she remarked, "I'm very sorry that I'm not as beautiful as I should be, but, you know - this is it. This is what you get."{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=8}} She continued to work on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], appearing in the 1976 double bill of [[Tennessee Williams]]' ''[[One act plays by Tennessee Williams#27 Wagons Full of Cotton|27 Wagons Full of Cotton]]'' and [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[A Memory of Two Mondays]]''. For the former, she received a Tony Award nomination for [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play|Best Featured Actress in a Play]].&lt;ref name="Lowell"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lowell, Katherine|title=Show Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TzymQOKwgYsC&amp;pg=PA2001|publisher=Clinton Gilkie|page=2001|id=GGKEY:XQ5TU8D6L6X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streep's other Broadway credits include [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'' and the [[Bertolt Brecht]]-[[Kurt Weill]] musical ''[[Happy End (musical)|Happy End]]'', in which she had originally appeared off-Broadway at the [[Chelsea Theater Center]]. She received [[Drama Desk Award]] nominations for both productions.{{Sfn|Fisher|2011|p=772}}

Streep's first feature film role came opposite [[Jane Fonda]] in the 1977 film ''[[Julia (1977 film)|Julia]]'', in which she had a small role during a flashback sequence. Most of her scenes were edited out, but the brief time on screen horrified the actress: "I had a bad wig and they took the words from the scene I shot with Jane and put them in my mouth in a different scene. I thought, I've made a terrible mistake, no more movies. I hate this business."{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=10}} However, Streep cites Fonda as having a lasting influence on her as an actress, and has credited her as "open[ing] probably more doors than I probably even know about".&lt;ref name="VF"/&gt;

====Breakthrough====

Robert De Niro, who had spotted Streep in her stage production of ''The Cherry Orchard'', suggested that she play the role of his girlfriend in the war film ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' (1978).{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=21}} Cazale, who had been diagnosed with [[lung cancer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/on-the-anniversary-of-his-death-revisit-john-cazal-93634|title=On the anniversary of his death, revisit John Cazale's tragically short film career in I Knew It Was You|publisher=[[The A.V.

In the 1978 mini-series ''[[Holocaust (miniseries)|Holocaust]]'', Streep played the leading role of a German woman married to a [[Jewish]] artist in [[Nazi era]] Germany. She found the material to be "unrelentingly noble" and professed to have taken on the role for financial gain.&lt;ref name="SimplyStreepHorizonMagazine1978"&gt;{{cite web|title=Magazines Archive |publisher=SimplyStreep.com |url=http://www.simplystreep.com/magazines/197808horizon.htm |accessdate=June 7, 2009 }}{{Dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} citing {{cite journal |work=Horizon Magazine |date=August 1978 |title=Star Treks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streep travelled to Germany and Austria for filming while Cazale remained in New York. Upon her return, Streep found that Cazale's illness had progressed, and she nursed him until his death on March 12, 1978.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=26}}{{Sfn|Hollinger|2006|p=81}} With an estimated audience of 109 million, ''Holocaust'' brought a wider degree of public recognition to Streep, who found herself "on the verge of national visibility". She won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie]] for her performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/bios/meryl-streep |title=Meryl Streep Emmy Award Winner |publisher=[[Emmy Award]] |accessdate=April 20, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905063934/http://www.emmys.com/bios/meryl-streep |archivedate=September 5, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the awards success, Streep was still not enthusiastic towards her film career and preferred acting on stage.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=44}}

Hoping to divert herself from the grief of Cazale's death, Streep accepted a role in ''[[The Seduction of Joe Tynan]]'' (1979) as the chirpy love interest of [[Alan Alda]], later commenting that she played it on "automatic pilot". She performed the role of [[Kate (The Taming of the Shrew)|Katherine]] in ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' for [[Shakespeare in the Park]], and also played a supporting role in ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'' (1979) for [[Woody Allen]]. Streep later said that Allen did not provide her with a complete script, giving her only the six pages of her own scenes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magazines Archive |publisher=SimplyStreep.com |url=http://www.simplystreep.com/magazines/197903lookmagazine.htm |accessdate=June 7, 2009 }}{{Dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} citing {{cite journal |work=Look Magazine |date=March 1979 |title=Streep Year}}&lt;/ref&gt; and did not permit her to improvise a word of her dialogue.{{sfn|Hollinger|2006|p=71}} In the drama ''[[Kramer vs. Kramer]]'', Streep was cast opposite [[Dustin Hoffman]] as an unhappily married woman who abandons her husband and child. Streep thought that the script portrayed the female character as "too evil" and insisted that it was not representative of real women who faced marriage breakdown and child custody battles. The makers agreed with her, and the script was revised.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=41}} In preparing for the part, Streep spoke to her own mother about her life as a wife with a career,{{Sfn|Hollinger|2006|p=75}} and frequented the [[Upper East Side]] neighborhood in which the film was set, watching the interactions between parents and children.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=41}} The director [[Robert Benton]] allowed Streep to write her own dialogue in two key scenes, despite some objection from Hoffman, who "hated her guts".{{Sfn|Hollinger|2006|p=77}}{{Efn|Streep's initial impression of Hoffman had been a negative one, thinking him to have been an "obnoxious pig" when she had first met him on stage several years earlier, and Hoffman had admitted that he initially "hated her guts", but respected her as an actress.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=41}}}} Jaffee and Hoffman later spoke of Streep's tirelessness, with Hoffman commenting, "She's extraordinarily hard-working, to the extent that she's obsessive. I think that she thinks about nothing else, but what she's doing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magazines Archive |publisher=SimplyStreep.com |url=http://www.simplystreep.com/magazines/197911playgirl.htm |accessdate=June 7, 2009 }}{{Dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} citing {{cite journal |work=Playgirl Magazine |date=November 1979 |title=The Freshest Face in Hollywood}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was controversial among feminists, but it was a role which film critic [[Stephen Farber]] believed displayed Streep's "own emotional intensity", writing that she was one of the "rare performers who can imbue the most routine moments with a hint of mystery".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=46}}

For ''Kramer vs. Kramer'', Streep won both the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress - Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award]] and the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]], which she famously left in the ladies room after giving her speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 52nd Academy Awards {{!}} 1980|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1980|publisher=Oscars.

===1980s===

====Rise to stardom====
In 1979, Streep began workshopping ''Alice in Concert'', a musical version of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', with writer and composer [[Elizabeth Swados]] and director [[Joseph Papp]]; the show was put on at New York's Public Theater from December 1980. [[Frank Rich]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to Streep as the production's "one wonder" but questioned why she devoted so much energy to it.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=44}} By 1980, Streep had progressed to leading roles in films. She was featured on the cover of ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine with the headline "A Star for the 80s"; [[Jack Kroll]] commented, "There's a sense of mystery in her acting; she doesn't simply imitate (although she's a great mimic in private). She transmits a sense of danger, a primal unease lying just below the surface of normal behavior".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=49}} Streep denounced her fervent media coverage at the time as "excessive hype".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=49}}

The [[story within a story]] drama ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman (film)|The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'' (1981) was Streep's first leading role. The film paired Streep with [[Jeremy Irons]] as contemporary actors, telling their modern story, as well as the [[Victorian era]] drama they were performing. Streep perfected an English accent for the part, but considered herself a misfit for the role: " I couldn't help wishing that I was more beautiful".{{sfn|Palmer|Bray|2013|p=227}}{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=49}}{{Efn|Despite Streep's own negative self-body-image, President Obama while presenting the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] remarked, "Anyone who saw ''The French Lieutenant's Woman'' had a crush on her..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newsvideo/celebrity-news-video/8935130/Barack-Obama-reveals-Meryl-Streep-crush-at-Kennedy-Centre-Honours.html|title=Barack Obama reveals Meryl Streep 'crush' at Kennedy Centre Honours|work=The Telegraph|date=December 5, 2011|accessdate=July 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711104408/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newsvideo/celebrity-news-video/8935130/Barack-Obama-reveals-Meryl-Streep-crush-at-Kennedy-Centre-Honours.html|archivedate=July 11, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} A ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine article commented that, while many female stars of the past had cultivated a singular identity in their films, Streep was a "[[chameleon]]", willing to play any type of role.&lt;ref name="NewYorkMagazineSep1981"&gt;{{cite news |last=Denby |first=David |title=Meryl Streep is Madonna and siren in ''The French Lieutenant's Woman'' |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=September 21, 1981 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-OUCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=Meryl+Streep&amp;lr=#PPA26,M1 |accessdate=June 15, 2009 |page=27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116203656/http://books.google.com/books?id=-OUCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=Meryl+Streep&amp;lr=#PPA26,M1 |archivedate=January 16, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Streep was awarded a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]] for her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/1982/film/actress|title=Film Actress in 1982|publisher=[[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]]|accessdate=January 16, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121015106/http://awards.bafta.org/award/1982/film/actress|archivedate=January 21, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, she re-united with Robert Benton for the [[psychological thriller]], ''[[Still of the Night (film)|Still of the Night]]'' (1982), co-starring [[Roy Scheider]] and [[Jessica Tandy]]. [[Vincent Canby]], writing for ''The New York Times'', noted that the film was an homage to the works of [[Alfred Hitchcock]], but that one of its main weaknesses was a lack of chemistry between Streep and Scheider, concluding that Streep "is stunning, but she's not on screen anywhere near long enough".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |title='Still of the Night', in Hitchcock Manner |work=The New York Times |date=September 20, 1985 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C02E2D8123BF93AA25752C1A964948260 |accessdate=June 6, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815033220/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C02E2D8123BF93AA25752C1A964948260 |archivedate=August 15, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greater success came later in the year when Streep starred in the drama ''[[Sophie's Choice (film)|Sophie's Choice]]'' (also 1982), portraying a Polish [[holocaust survivor]] caught in a love triangle between a young nave writer ([[Peter MacNicol]]) and a Jewish intellectual ([[Kevin Kline]]).

There is hardly an emotion that Streep doesn't touch in this movie, and yet we're never aware of her straining. This is one of the most astonishing and yet one of the most unaffected and natural performances I can imagine."{{Sfn|Ebert|2010|p=222}} Pauline Kael, on the contrary, called the film an "infuriatingly bad movie", and thought that Streep "decorporealizes" herself, which she believed explained why her movie heroines "don't seem to be full characters, and why there are no incidental joys to be had from watching her".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|pp=62, 53}}

[[File:Meryl Streep (2071470089) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Streep in 1989]]

The year 1983 saw Streep play her first non-fictional character, the [[nuclear whistleblowers|nuclear whistleblower]] and labor union activist Karen Silkwood who died in a suspicious car accident while investigating alleged wrongdoing at the [[Kerr-McGee]] [[plutonium]] plant, in [[Mike Nichols]]'s biographical film ''[[Silkwood]]''. Streep felt a personal connection to Silkwood,{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=69}} and in preparation she met with people close to the woman, and in doing so realized that each person saw a different aspect of her personality.{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=64}} She said, "I didn't try to turn myself into Karen. I just tried to look at what she did. I put together every piece of information I could find about her... What I finally did was look at the events in her life, and try to understand her from the inside."{{Sfn|Ebert|2006|p=64}} Jack Kroll of ''Newsweek'' considered Streep's characterization to have been "brilliant", while Silkwood's boyfriend Drew Stephens expressed approval in that Streep had played Karen as a human being rather than a myth, despite Karen's father Bill thinking that Streep and the film had dumbed his daughter down. Pauline Kael believed that Streep had been miscast.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=78}} Streep next played opposite Robert De Niro in the romance ''[[Falling in Love (1984 film)|Falling in Love]]'' (1984), which was poorly received, and portrayed a fighter for the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]] in the British drama ''[[Plenty (film)|Plenty]]'' (1985), adapted from the play by &lt;!-- Not knighted until 1998. --&gt;[[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]]. For the latter, Roger Ebert wrote that she conveyed "great subtlety; it is hard to play an unbalanced, neurotic, self-destructive woman, and do it with such gentleness and charm... Streep creates a whole character around a woman who could have simply been a catalogue of symptoms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |title='Plenty' review |work=Chicago Sun-Times |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19850920/REVIEWS/509200303/1023 |date=November 19, 1982 |accessdate=June 6, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616153759/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19850920%2FREVIEWS%2F509200303%2F1023 |archivedate=June 16, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, [[Molly Haskell]] praised Streep's performance in ''Plenty'', believing it to be "one of Streep's most difficult and ambiguous" films and "most feminist" role.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=92}}

====''Out of Africa'' and backlash====
Longworth considers Streep's next release, ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' (1985), to have established her as a Hollywood superstar. In the film, Streep starred as the Danish writer [[Karen Blixen]], opposite [[Robert Redford]]'s [[Denys Finch Hatton]]. Director [[Sydney Pollack]] was initially dubious about Streep in the role, as he did not think she was sexy enough, and had considered [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] for the part. Pollack recalls that Streep impressed him in a different way: "She was so direct, so honest, so without bullshit. There was no shielding between her and me."{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=81}} Streep and Pollack often clashed during the 101-day shoot in Kenya, particularly over Blixen's voice. Streep had spent much time listening to tapes of Blixen, and began speaking in an old-fashioned and aristocratic fashion, which Pollack thought excessive.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=88}} A significant commercial and critical success, the film earned Streep another Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, and the film ultimately won Best Picture. Critic [[Stanley Kaufmann]] wrote, "Meryl Streep is back in top form. This means her performance in ''Out of Africa'' is at the highest level of acting in film today."{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=93}}

Longworth notes that the dramatic success of ''Out of Africa'' led to a backlash of critical opinion against Streep in the years that followed, especially as she was now demanding $4 million a picture. Unlike other stars at the time, such as [[Sylvester Stallone]] and [[Tom Cruise]], Streep "never seemed to play herself", and certain critics felt her technical finesse led people to literally see her acting.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=97}} Her next films did not appeal to a wide audience; she co-starred with [[Jack Nicholson]] in the dramas ''[[Heartburn (film)|Heartburn]]'' (1986) and ''[[Ironweed (film)|Ironweed]]'' (1987), in which she sang onscreen for the first time since the television movie ''Secret Service'' (1977). In ''[[Evil Angels (film)|Evil Angels]]''{{Efn|The film was released in Australia as ''Evil Angels''.}} (1988), she played [[Lindy Chamberlain]], an Australian woman who had been convicted of the [[Death of Azaria Chamberlain|murder of her infant daughter]] despite claiming that the baby had been taken by a [[dingo]]. Filmed in Australia, Streep won the [[Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]],{{sfn|Waldo|2006|p=209}}{{sfn|Speed|Wilson|1989|p=38}}{{sfn|Eberwein p.217|2010|p=217}}{{sfn|Newsweek|1988|p=85}} a [[Prix d'interprtation fminine|Best Actress]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress]].{{Sfn|Eberwein|2010|p=221}} Streep has said of perfecting the Australian accent in the film: "I had to study a little bit for Australian because it's not dissimilar [to&lt;!-- not "from" (UK usage) --&gt; American], so it's like coming from Italian to Spanish. You get a little mixed up."&lt;ref name="Brockes06"/&gt; Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' referred to her performance as "another stunning performance", played with "the kind of virtuosity that seems to re-define the possibilities of screen acting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Canby, Vincent|authorlink=Vincent Canby|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DE1DF1039F932A25752C1A96E948260|title=A Cry in the Dark|work=The New York Times|date=November 11, 1988|accessdate=July 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704073433/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DE1DF1039F932A25752C1A96E948260|archivedate=July 4, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Streep lobbied to play the lead role in [[Oliver Stone]]'s adaption of the play ''Evita'', but two months before filming was due to commence, she dropped out, citing "exhaustion" initially, although it was later revealed that there was a dispute over her salary.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=99}} By the end of the decade, Streep actively looked to star in a comedy. She found the role in ''[[She-Devil]]'' (1989), a satire that parodied societal obsession with beauty and cosmetic surgery, in which she played a glamorous writer.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=106}} Though the film was not a success, [[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' wrote that Streep was the "one reason" to see it, and observed that it marked a departure from the dramatic roles she was known to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Corliss |first=Richard |title=Warty Worm, "She-Devil" review |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959340,00.html |work=Time |date=December 11, 1989 |accessdate=June 7, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906045113/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959340,00.html |archivedate=September 6, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reacting to her string of poorly received films, Streep said: "Audiences are shrinking; as the marketing strategy defines more and more narrowly who they want to reach males from 16 to 25 - it's become a chicken-and-egg syndrome. Which came first? First, they release all these summer movies, then do a demographic survey of who's going to see them."{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=99}}

===1990s===

====Unsuccessful comedies, and ''The Bridges of Madison County''====
[[File:Meryl in 1990.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Meryl Streep at the [[32nd Grammy Awards]] in 1990]]
Biographer Karen Hollinger described the early 1990s as a downturn in the popularity of Streep's films, attributing this partly to a critical perception that her comedies had been an attempt to convey a lighter image following several serious, but commercially unsuccessful, dramas, and, more significantly, to the lack of options available to an actress in her forties.{{Sfn|Hollinger|2006|p=78}} Streep commented that she had limited her options by her preference to work in Los Angeles, close to her family,{{Sfn|Hollinger|2006|p=78}} a situation that she had anticipated in a 1981 interview when she commented, "By the time an actress hits her mid-forties, no one's interested in her anymore. And if you want to fit a couple of babies into that schedule as well, you've got to pick your parts with great care."&lt;ref name="NewYorkMagazineSep1981" /&gt; At the [[Screen Actor's Guild]] National Women's Conference in 1990, Streep keynoted the first national event, emphasizing the decline in women's work opportunities, pay parity, and role models within the film industry.&lt;ref name="SAG timeline"&gt;{{cite web |title=SAG History - SAG Timeline |url=http://www.sag.org/content/womens-committee |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125115603/http://www.sag.org/content/womens-committee |archivedate=January 25, 2012 |accessdate=July 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She criticized the film industry for downplaying the importance of women both on screen and off.{{sfn|Eberwein|2010|p=221}}

After roles in the comedy-drama ''[[Postcards from the Edge (film)|Postcards from the Edge]]'' (1990), and the comedy-fantasy ''[[Defending Your Life]]'' (1991), Streep starred with [[Goldie Hawn]] in the farcical black comedy, ''[[Death Becomes Her]]'' (1992), with [[Bruce Willis]] as their co-star. Streep persuaded writer [[David Koepp]] to re-write several of the scenes, particularly the one in which her character has an affair with a younger man, which she believed was "unrealistically male" in its conception. The seven-month shoot was the longest of Streep's career, during which she got into character by "thinking about being slightly pissed off all of the time".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|pp=100, 103}} Due to Streep's allergies to numerous cosmetics, special prosthetics had to be designed to age her by ten years to look 54, although Streep believed that they made her look nearer 70.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=103}} Longworth considers ''Death Becomes Her'' to have been "the most physical performance Streep had yet committed to screen, all broad weeping, smirking, and eye-rolling".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=100}} Although it was a commercial success, earning $15.1 million in just five days, Streep's contribution to comedy was generally not taken well by critics.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=107}} ''Time''{{'}}s Richard Corliss wrote approvingly of Streep's "wicked-witch routine" but dismissed the film as "''She-Devil'' with a make-over" and one which "hates women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Corliss |first=Richard |title=Beverly Hills Corpse, "Death Becomes Her" review |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976129,00.html |work=Time |date=August 3, 1992 |accessdate=June 7, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904022133/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976129,00.html |archivedate=September 4, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=107}}

Streep appeared with [[Jeremy Irons]], [[Glenn Close]] and [[Winona Ryder]] in ''[[The House of the Spirits (film)|The House of the Spirits]]'' (1993), set during the military dictatorship of Chile. The film was not well received by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_house_of_the_spirits/|title=The House of the Spirits|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]].

Reilly]]) in the wilderness. Though critical reaction was generally mixed, [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' found her to be "strong, sassy and looser than she has ever been onscreen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Travers|first=Peter|title=The River Wild|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/the-river-wild-19940930|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=September 20, 1994|accessdate=May 5, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505072025/http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/the-river-wild-19940930|archivedate=May 5, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Streep's most successful film of the decade was the romance ''[[The Bridges of Madison County (film)|The Bridges of Madison County]]'' (1995) directed by [[Clint Eastwood]], who adapted the film from [[Robert James Waller]]'s novel of the same name.{{Sfn|McGilligan|1999|p=492}} It relates the story of Robert Kincaid (Eastwood), a photographer working for ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', who has a love affair with a middle-aged Italian farm wife in [[Iowa]] named Francesca (Streep). Though Streep disliked the novel it was based on, she found the script to be a special opportunity for an actress her age.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|pp=111-112}} She gained weight for the part, and dressed differently from the character in the book to emulate voluptuous Italian film stars such as [[Sophia Loren]]. Both Loren and [[Anna Magnani]] were an influence in her portrayal, and Streep viewed [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s ''[[Mamma Roma]]'' (1962) prior to filming.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=115}} The film was a box office hit and grossed over $70 million in the United States.{{Sfn|McGilligan|1999|p=503}} The film, unlike the novel, was warmly received by critics. [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Eastwood had managed to create "a moving, elegiac love story at the heart of Mr. Waller's self-congratulatory overkill", while [[Joe Morgenstern]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' described it as "one of the most pleasurable films in recent memory".{{Sfn|McGilligan|1999|p=503}} Longworth believes that Streep's performance was "crucial to transforming what could have been a weak soap opera into a vibrant work of historical fiction implicitly critiquing postwar America's stifling culture of domesticity".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=16}} She considers it to have been the role in which Streep became "arguably the first middle-aged actress to be taken seriously by Hollywood as a romantic heroine".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=117}}

====Late 1990s====
Streep played the estranged sister of Bessie ([[Diane Keaton]]), a woman battling [[leukemia]], in ''[[Marvin's Room (film)|Marvin's Room]]'' (1996), an adaptation of the play by [[Scott McPherson]]. Streep recommended Keaton for the role.{{Sfn|Mitchell|2001|p=139}} The film also featured [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as the rebellious son of Streep's character. Roger Ebert stated that, "Streep and Keaton, in their different styles, find ways to make Lee and Bessie into much more than the expression of their problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970110/REVIEWS/701100302/1023|title=Review- Marvin's Room|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=January 10, 1997|accessdate=March 25, 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110152119/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19970110%2FREVIEWS%2F701100302%2F1023|archivedate=January 10, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was well received, and Streep earned another Golden Globe nomination for her performance.&lt;ref name=GoldenGlobes /&gt;

As an Irishwoman, Streep acted opposite [[Michael Gambon]] and [[Catherine McCormack]] in [[Pat O'Connor (director)|Pat O'Connor]]'s ''[[Dancing at Lughnasa (film)|Dancing at Lughnasa]]'' (1998), which was entered into the [[Venice Film Festival]] in its year of release. {{sfn|Allon|Cullen||Patterson|2001|p=255}} Janet Maslin of ''The New York Times'' remarked that "Meryl Streep has made many a grand acting gesture in her career, but the way she simply peers out a window in ''Dancing at Lughnasa'' ranks with the best. Everything the viewer need know about Kate Mundy, the woman she plays here, is written on that prim, lonely face and its flabbergasted gaze".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Maslin, Janet|authorlink=Janet Maslin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B04E3DA1431F930A25752C1A96E958260|title=Dancing at Lughnasa (1998)|work=The New York Times|date=November 13, 1998|accessdate=July 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704073438/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B04E3DA1431F930A25752C1A96E958260|archivedate=July 4, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, she played a cancer sufferer caught in a difficult family situation, playing the mother of [[Rene Zellweger]] and wife of [[William Hurt]] in ''[[One True Thing]]''. The film gained positive reviews. [[Mick LaSalle]] in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' declared, "After 'One True Thing', critics who persist in the fiction that Streep is a cold and technical actress will need to get their heads examined.

Streep portrayed [[Roberta Guaspari]], a real-life New Yorker who found passion and enlightenment teaching violin to the inner-city kids of [[East Harlem]], in the music drama ''[[Music of the Heart]]'' (1999). A departure from director [[Wes Craven]]'s previous work in films like ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' and the ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'' series, Streep replaced singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], who left the project before filming began due to creative differences with Craven.&lt;ref name="New York Post"/&gt;{{Sfn|Caparrs|2001|p=91}} Required to perform on the violin, Streep went through two months of intense training, five to six hours a day.&lt;ref name="New York Post"&gt;{{cite news|author=Hoffman, Barbara|title=MAKING 'MUSIC' : WES CRAVEN MOVES FROM VIOLENCE TO VIOLINS|url=https://nypost.com/1999/10/24/making-music-wes-craven-moves-from-violence-to-violins/|work=New York Post|date=October 24, 1999|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116030848/https://nypost.com/1999/10/24/making-music-wes-craven-moves-from-violence-to-violins/|archivedate=November 16, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streep received nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] for her performance. Roger Ebert wrote that "Meryl Streep is known for her mastery of accents; she may be the most versatile speaker in the movies. Here you might think she has no accent, unless you've heard her real speaking voice; then you realize that Guaspari's speaking style is no less a particular achievement than Streep's other accents. This is not Streep's voice, but someone else's - with a certain flat quality, as if later education and refinement came after a somewhat unsophisticated childhood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19991029/REVIEWS/910290302/1023|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Music of the Heart Movie Review|work=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=May 1, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928090907/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19991029%2FREVIEWS%2F910290302%2F1023|archivedate=September 28, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has stated that she has no particular method when it comes to acting, learning from the days of her early studies that she cannot articulate her practice. She said in 1987, "I have a smattering of things I've learned from different teachers, but nothing I can put into a valise and open it up and say, 'Now, which one would you like?' Nothing I can count on, and that makes it more dangerous. But then, the danger makes it more exciting." She has stated that her ideal director is one who gives her complete artistic control, and allowing her a degree of improvisation and to learn from her own mistakes.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=12}}

Karina Longworth notes how "external" Streep's performances are, "chameleonic" in her impersonation of characters, "subsuming herself into them, rather than personifying them". In her early roles such as ''Manhattan'' and ''Kramer vs. Kramer'', she was compared to both [[Diane Keaton]] and [[Jill Clayburgh]], in that her characters were unsympathetic, which Streep has attributed to the tendency to be drawn to playing women who are difficult to like and lack empathy.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=12}} Streep has stated that many consider her to be a technical actor, but she professed that it comes down to her love of reading the initial script, adding, "I come ready and I don't want to screw around and waste the first 10 takes on adjusting lighting and everybody else getting comfortable".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=16}}

[[File:Meryl Streep - Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|Streep's star on the ''[[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]'']]
Mike Nichols, who directed Streep in ''Silkwood'', ''Heartburn'', ''Postcards from the Edge'', and ''Angels in America'', praised Streep's ability to transform herself into her characters, remarking that, "In every role, she becomes a totally new human being. As she becomes the person she is portraying, the other performers begin to react to her as if she were that person."{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=70}} He said that directing her is "so much like falling in love that it has the characteristics of a time which you remember as magical, but which is shrouded in mystery".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=73}} He also noted that Streep's acting ability had a profound impact on her co-stars, and that "one could improve by 1000% purely by watching her".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=70}}
Longworth believes that in nearly every film, Streep has "sly infused" a feminist point of view in her portrayals.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=15}} However, film critic [[Molly Haskell]] has stated, "None of her heroines are feminist, strictly speaking. Yet, they uncannily embody various crosscurrents of experience in the last twenty years, as women have re-defined themselves against the background of the women's movement".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=16}}

On January 8, 2017, Streep accepted the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award|Cecil B. DeMille Award for Lifetime Achievement]] at the Golden Globes, during which she delivered a highly political speech that criticized then-President-elect [[Donald Trump]] (without naming him by name). She said that Trump had a very strong platform and was using it inappropriately. She said that he mocked a disabled reporter, [[Serge F. Kovaleski]], whom, in her words, Trump "outranked in privilege, power, and the capacity to fight back", and that, "When the powerful use their position to bully, we all lose". She also said, "Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners, and if you kick us all out, you'll have nothing to watch except for football and mixed martial arts, which are not arts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Golden Globes: Meryl Streep Talks Immigration, Takes Aim at Donald Trump in Passionate Speech|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/watch-meryl-streep-accept-cecil-b-demille-award-golden-globes-2017-961510|agency=Hollywood Reporter|date=January 8, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109191310/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/watch-meryl-streep-accept-cecil-b-demille-award-golden-globes-2017-961510|archivedate=January 9, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/columns/academy-awards-meryl-streep-asghar-farhadi-donald-trump-politics-1201973551/|title=Why Its Okay for the Oscars to Get Political|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|date=January 31, 2017|newspaper=Variety|access-date=February 7, 2017|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208133115/http://variety.com/2017/film/columns/academy-awards-meryl-streep-asghar-farhadi-donald-trump-politics-1201973551/|archivedate=February 8, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump responded on Twitter by calling Streep "one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood", and "a [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary]] flunky who lost big".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barraclough|first1=Leo|title=Donald Trump Lashes Back at Meryl Streep, Calls Her an Overrated Actress|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/awards/donald-trump-calls-meryl-streep-overrated-actress-1201955800/|work=Variety|date=January 9, 2017|quote=Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn't know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes.

==Personal life==
Author Karina Longworth notes that despite her "high level of stardom" for decades, Streep has managed to maintain a relatively normal personal life.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=7}} Streep lived with actor [[John Cazale]] for three years until his death from [[lung cancer]] in March 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/on-the-anniversary-of-his-death-revisit-john-cazal-93634|title=On the anniversary of his death, revisit John Cazale's tragically short film career in ''I Knew It Was You''|first=Kevin|last=McFarland|publisher=The A.V.

I don't want to get over it. No matter what you do, the pain is always there in some recess of your mind, and it affects everything that happens afterwards. I think you can assimilate the pain and go on without making an obsession of it."{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=46}}

Streep married sculptor [[Don Gummer]] six months after Cazale's death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Hw4gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pmUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1223,438388&amp;dq=meryl+streep+don+gummer&amp;hl=en The Lewiston Daily Sun, October 3, 1978].

When asked if religion plays a part in her life in 2009, Streep replied: "I follow no doctrine. I don't belong to a church or a temple or a synagogue or an [[ashram]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Movies, Marriage, and Turning Sixty'. ''[[The Independent]]''. January 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in December 2008, she also alluded to her lack of religious belief when she said: "So, I've always been really, deeply interested, because I think I can understand the solace that's available in the whole construct of religion. But I really don't believe in the power of prayer, or things would have been avoided that have happened, that are awful. So, it's a horrible position as an intelligent, emotional, yearning human being to sit outside of the available comfort there. But I just can't go there."&lt;ref name="The Telegraph 356396" /&gt;

When asked from where she draws consolation in the face of aging and death, Streep responded: "Consolation? I'm not sure I have it. I have a belief, I guess, in the power of the aggregate human attempt - the best of ourselves. In love and hope and optimism - you know, the magic things that seem inexplicable. Why we are the way we are. I do have a sense of trying to make things better. Where does that come from?"&lt;ref name="The Telegraph 356396"&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Mick|title=Meryl Streep: mother superior|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3563965/Meryl-Streep-mother-superior.html|work=The Week|accessdate=December 4, 2008|location=London|date=December 4, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210074454/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3563965/Meryl-Streep-mother-superior.html|archivedate=December 10, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
