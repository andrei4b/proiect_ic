Born in [[Pretoria, South Africa]], Musk taught himself computer programming at the age of 12. He moved to Canada when he was 17 to attend [[Queen's University]]. He transferred to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] two years later, where he received an economics degree from the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton School]] and a degree in physics from the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]]. He began a Ph.D. in applied physics and material sciences at [[Stanford University]] in 1995 but dropped out after two days to pursue an entrepreneurial career. He subsequently co-founded [[Zip2]], a web software company, which was acquired by [[Compaq]] for $340 million in 1999. Musk then founded [[X.com]], an online payment company. It merged with [[Confinity]] in 2000 and became [[PayPal]], which was bought by [[eBay]] for $1.5 billion in October 2002.{{refn|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Martin LaMonica |title=Tesla Motors founders: Now there are five |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/tesla-motors-founders-now-there-are-five/ |quote= |newspaper=CNET |date=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://techcrunch.com/gallery/a-brief-history-of-tesla |title=A Brief history of Tesla |work=Tech Crunch |date=January 4, 2013 |accessdate=April 21, 2014 |quote="Tesla was founded not by Elon Musk, but rather by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in July 2003.

In May 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO and lead designer. He co-founded Tesla, Inc., an electric vehicle and solar panel manufacturer, in 2003, and operates as its CEO and product architect. In 2006, he inspired the creation of [[SolarCity]], a solar energy services company that is now a subsidiary of Tesla, and operates as its chairman. In 2015, Musk co-founded [[OpenAI]], a nonprofit research company that aims to promote [[friendly artificial intelligence]]. In July 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing [[braincomputer interface]]s, and is its CEO.  In December 2016, Musk founded [[The Boring Company]], an infrastructure and tunnel-construction company.

In addition to his primary business pursuits, Musk has envisioned a high-speed transportation system known as the [[Hyperloop]], and has proposed a [[VTOL|vertical take-off and landing]] supersonic jet [[electric aircraft]] with electric fan propulsion, known as the [[Musk electric jet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aviation.com/general-aviation/elon-musk-toying-designs-electric-jet/ |title=Elon Musk 'Toying' with Designs for Electric Jet |author=Jonathan Charlton |publisher=Aviation.com |accessdate=May 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxTPKIvn--A |title=Elon Musk on dodging a nervous breakdown (2013) |date=March 16, 2015 |publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group met with companies such as [[NPO Lavochkin]] and [[Kosmotras]]; however, according to Cantrell, Musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the Russian chief designers,&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; and the group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs, bringing along Mike Griffin. Griffin had worked for the CIA's venture capital arm, [[In-Q-Tel]], as well as NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], and was just leaving [[Orbital Sciences]], a maker of satellites and spacecraft. The group met again with Kosmotras, and were offered one rocket for {{US$|8&amp;nbsp;million}}; however, this was seen by Musk as too expensive; Musk consequently stormed out of the meeting.

Following the [[financial crisis in 2008]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Morrison |date=October 15, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/external/venturebeat/2008/10/15/15venturebeat-elon-musk-steps-in-as-ceo-at-tesla-lays-off-99182.html |title=Musk steps in as CEO |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect, positions he still holds today. Tesla Motors first built an electric sports car, the [[Tesla Roadster (2008)|Tesla Roadster]] in 2008, with sales of about 2,500 vehicles to 31 countries. Tesla began delivery of its four-door [[Tesla Model S|Model&amp;nbsp;S]] sedan on June 22, 2012.

Musk has favored building a sub-{{US$|30,000}} compact Tesla model and building and selling electric vehicle powertrain components so that other automakers can produce electric vehicles at affordable prices without having to develop the products in-house; this led to the [[Tesla Model 3|Model 3]] that is planned to have a base price of {{US$|35,000}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Elon |last=Musk |title=The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me) |date=August 2, 2006 |url=http://www.teslamotors.com/blog2/?p=8 |publisher=Tesla Motors}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several mainstream publications have compared him with [[Henry Ford]] for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains.&lt;ref name=thestar&gt;{{cite news |title=Tesla CEO following in Henry Ford's tracks |date=October 12, 2009 |first=Tyler |last=Hamilton |work=[[Toronto Star]] |url=https://www.thestar.com/iphone/article/Business/708847 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017115314/http://www.thestar.com/iphone/article/Business/708847 |archivedate=October 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a May 2013 interview with [[All Things Digital]], Musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars, Tesla is "dramatically accelerating" its network of supercharger stations, tripling the number on the East and West coasts of the U.S. that June, with plans for more expansion across [[North America]], including Canada, throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Jason |last=Del Ray |url=http://allthingsd.com/20130529/musk-youll-be-able-to-drive-your-tesla-cross-country-by-years-end-with-supercharger-expansion |title=Musk: You'll Be Able to Drive Your Tesla Cross-Country by Year's End With Supercharger Expansion |date=May 29, 2013 |publisher=[[All Things D]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 29, 2016, Musk owns about 28.9&amp;nbsp;million Tesla shares, which equates to about 22% of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-buys-tesla-shares-cheap-pays-hefty-tax-bill-with-own-cash-2016-01-29 |title=Elon Musk exercises Tesla options, pays million tax bill with own cash |author1=Claudia Assis |author2=Jeremy C.

In 2014, Musk announced that Tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in [[Good faith (law)|good faith]] in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up development of electric cars. "The unfortunate reality is electric car programs (or programs for any vehicle that doesn't burn [[hydrocarbons]]) at the major manufacturers are small to non-existent, constituting an average of far less than 1% of their total vehicle sales," Musk said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you |title=All Our Patent Are Belong To You |publisher=Tesla Motors |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, Musk announced that he had acquired the Tesla.com [[domain name]] from Stu Grossman, who had owned it since 1992, and changed Tesla's homepage to that domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Dana Hull |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-19/tesla-s-musk-gets-tesla-com-domain-name-after-waiting-a-decade |title=Musk Gets Tesla.com Domain Name After Waiting a Decade |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |date=February 19, 2016 |accessdate=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, Musk was granted a $2.6 billion award by the company, awarding him with 20.3 million shares and could raise Tesla's market value to $650 billion.

The money was used to build a factory and infrastructure for solar panel maker [[SolarCity]], which Tesla acquired. As of March 2018, the plant employed "just a few hundred workers and its future remains uncertain." (The Buffalo area actually lost nearly 5,000 jobs between December 2016 and December 2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2018/03/24/new-york-taxpayers-gift-to-elon-musk|title=New York taxpayers gift to Elon Musk|date=March 25, 2018|work=New York Post|access-date=April 10, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SolarCity===
{{Main|SolarCity}}
Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for [[SolarCity]], which was then co-founded in 2006 by his cousins [[Lyndon Rive|Lyndon and Peter Rive]].&lt;ref name="Management Team"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solarcity.com/media-center/management-team.aspx |publisher=SolarCity |title=Management Team}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kanellos"&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Kanellos |date=February 15, 2008 |title=Newsmaker: Elon Musk on rockets, sports cars, and solar power |url=http://news.cnet.com/Elon-Musk-on-rockets,-sports-cars,-and-solar-power---page-2/2008-11389_3-6230661-2.html |publisher=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/top-250-solar-contractors |title=2013 Top 250 Solar Contractors |work=Solar Power World |date=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SolarCity was acquired by Tesla, Inc. in 2016 and is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of Tesla.&lt;ref name="Shareholder Approval"&gt;{{cite web|title= Teslas Acquisition of SolarCity Receives Shareholder Approval|url=https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/blog/teslas-acquisition-of-solarcity-receives-shareholder-approval |accessdate=November 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2016/11/17/early-christmas-present-for-elon-musk-as-shareholders-bless-tesla-solarcity-merger/ |title=Early Christmas Present For Elon Musk As Shareholders Bless Tesla-SolarCity Merger|date=November 17, 2016|work=Forbes|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=closing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.tesla.com/secfiling.cfm?filingid=1193125-16-773705&amp;CIK=1318605|title=Tesla - Current Report|website=ir.tesla.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The underlying motivation for funding both SolarCity and Tesla was to help combat global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOl_1S10jTk |title=The unveiling of the Tesla Motors Electric Car |publisher=Autoblog |accessdate=July 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Musk announced that SolarCity and Tesla are collaborating to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid, with the program going live in 2013.&lt;ref name="KQED-SolarCity"&gt;{{cite web |last=Diggelen |first=Alison van |title=Tesla and SolarCity Collaborate on Clean Energy Storage |url=http://blogs.kqed.org/climatewatch/2012/04/24/tesla-and-solarcity-collaborate-on-clean-energy-storage |publisher=KQED |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 17, 2014, Musk committed to building a SolarCity advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States. Musk stated the plant will be "one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world," and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/17/news/companies/solarcity-silevo |title=Elon Musk's sunny plans for Buffalo |author=Aaron Smith |publisher=[[CNNMoney]] |date=June 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2016|3|15}}&lt;!-- so what has happened with this plant in the past 20 months? is it built? or still in the planning stages? or ??? --&gt;

===Hyperloop===
{{Main|Hyperloop|Hyperloop pod competition}}

On August 12, 2013, Musk unveiled a concept for a high-speed transportation system incorporating reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an [[Air bearing|air cushion]] driven by [[linear induction motor]]s and [[air compressor]]s.&lt;ref name=gm20130822&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmag.com/hyperloop-musk-analysis/28672 |title=Beyond the hype of Hyperloop: An analysis of Elon Musk's proposed transit system |work=Gizmag.com |date=August 22, 2013 |accessdate=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism for releasing the concept was an alpha-design document that, in addition to scoping out the technology, outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built: between the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-08-12/revealed-elon-musk-explains-the-hyperloop |title=Revealed: Elon Musk Explains the Hyperloop, the Solar-Powered High-Speed Future of Inter-City Transportation |author=[[Ashlee Vance]] |work=[[Bloomberg BusinessWeek]] |accessdate=April 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After earlier envisioning Hyperloop, Musk assigned a dozen engineers from [[Tesla Inc.|Tesla]] and [[SpaceX]] who worked for nine months, establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hannahelliott/2013/08/12/latest-update-elon-musk-will-start-the-hyperloop-himself/#5143db7047a8 |title=Hyperloop Update: Elon Musk Will Start Developing It Himself |publisher=Forbes.com |accessdate=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmag.com/musk-developing-hyperloop-demonstrator/28684/ |title=Musk announces plans to build Hyperloop demonstrator |publisher=gizmag.com |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early design for the system was then published in a [[whitepaper]] posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/hyperloop_alpha-20130812.pdf |title=Hyperloop Alpha |first=Elon |last=Musk |work=SpaceX |date=August 12, 2013 |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AlphaTesla"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/hyperloop |title=Hyperloop |first=Elon |last=Musk |work=Tesla |date=August 12, 2013 |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/hyperloop-designed-quick-convenient-commute/story?id=19936169 |title=Hyperloop Designed for Quick, Convenient Commute |publisher=ABC News |date=March 9, 2013 |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musk's proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other [[mode of transport]] for such long distances. The alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce [[aerodynamic drag]], which it is theorized would allow for high-speed travel with relatively low power, with certain other features like air-bearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce freestream flow. The document of alpha design estimated the total cost of an LA-to-SF Hyperloop system at {{US$|6&amp;nbsp;billion}}, but this amount is speculative.&lt;!-- this last phrase seems redundant --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hyperloop |publisher=SpaceX |url=http://www.spacex.com/hyperloop |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, Musk announced a [[incentive prize competition|design competition]] for students and others to build Hyperloop pods to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track in a 20152017 [[Hyperloop pod competition]]. The track was used in January 2017, and Musk also started building a tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailybulletin.com/science/20170129/hyperloop-competition-brings-new-mass-transit-technology-to-life-in-hawthorne |title=Hyperloop competition brings new mass-transit technology to life in Hawthorne |last=Mazza |first=Sandy |date=January 29, 2017 |publisher=Daily Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hyperloop One]], a company unaffiliated with Musk, had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its DevLoop track in Nevada on July 13, 2017. It was on May 12, 2017 at 12:02&amp;nbsp;a.m. and had lasted 5.3 seconds, reaching a top speed of 70&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/14/15960686/hyperloop-one-test-success-interview-giegel-pishevar |title=Talking to Hyperloop One about its big 'Kitty Hawk' moment  and what comes next |last=Hawkins |first=Andrew J. |date=July 14, 2017 |website=The Verge|access-date=July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 20, 2017, Elon Musk announced that he had gotten "verbal government approval" to build a hyperloop from [[New York City]] to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C]], stopping in both [[Philadelphia]] and [[Baltimore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/20/538328487/elon-musk-says-he-has-verbal-ok-to-build-n-y-d-c-hyperloop |title=Elon Musk Says He Has 'Verbal' OK To Build N.Y.-D.C.

===OpenAI===
{{Main|OpenAI}}
In December 2015, Musk announced the creation of [[OpenAI]], a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company. OpenAI aims to develop [[artificial general intelligence]] in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity.&lt;ref name="NYT_AI"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/12/science/artificial-intelligence-research-center-is-founded-by-silicon-valley-investors.html |title=Artificial-Intelligence Research Center Is Founded by Silicon Valley Investors |first1=John |last1=Markoff |date=December 11, 2015 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |accessdate=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By making AI available to everyone, OpenAI wants to "counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning super-intelligence systems devoted to profits, as well as governments which may use AI to gain power and even oppress their citizenry."&lt;ref name=levy20151215&gt;{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/backchannel/how-elon-musk-and-y-combinator-plan-to-stop-computers-from-taking-over-17e0e27dd02a |title=How Elon Musk and Y Combinator Plan to Stop Computers From Taking Over |first1=Steven |last1=Levy |date=December 11, 2015 |publisher=[[Medium (publishing platform)|Medium]]/''[[Backchannel (blog)|Backchannel]]'' |accessdate=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musk has stated he wants to counteract the concentration of power.&lt;ref name=rollingstone20171115/&gt; In 2018 Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid "potential future conflict" with his role as CEO of Tesla as Tesla increasingly becomes involved in AI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elon Musk, who has sounded the alarm on AI, leaves the organization he co-founded to make it safer|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/21/elon-musk-is-leaving-the-board-of-openai.html|accessdate=February 28, 2018|work=CNBC|date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuralink===
{{Main|Neuralink}}

In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a [[neurotechnology]] startup company, to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence. The company, which is still in the earliest stages of existence, is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain, with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence. These enhancements could improve memory or allow for more direct interfacing with computing devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/27/15077864/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-computer-interface-ai-cyborgs |title=Elon Musk launches Neuralink, a venture to merge the human brain with AI |date=March 27, 2017 |website=The Verge|access-date=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Musk sees Neuralink and OpenAI as related: "OpenAI is a nonprofit dedicated to minimizing the dangers of artificial intelligence, while Neuralink is working on ways to implant technology into our brains to create mind-computer interfaces. ... Neuralink allows our brains to keep up in the intelligence race. The machines can't outsmart us if we have everything the machines have plus everything we have. At least, that is if you assume that what we have is actually an advantage."&lt;ref name=rollingstone20171115/&gt;

==Political views==
[[File:The Summit 2013.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Musk speaking alongside former Irish [[Taoiseach]] (Prime Minister) [[Enda Kenny]]]]
Politically, Musk has described himself as "half [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], half [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]." In his own words: "I'm somewhere in the middle, socially liberal and fiscally conservative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1OPxitgvmw |title=Elon Musk: The Way Of The Future |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, Musk became a member of two of then [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] [[Donald Trump]]'s presidential advisory committees (the [[Strategic and Policy Forum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://greatagain.gov/president-elect-trump-announces-additional-members-of-presidents-strategic-and-policy-forum-8aa8822eced9#.4coc2gtxc |title=President-Elect Trump Announces Additional Members of President's Strategic and Policy Forum |first=The Transition |last=Team |date=December 14, 2016 |publisher= |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/12/14/elon-musk-and-the-ceo-of-uber-are-now-advising-donald-trump/ |title=Elon Musk and the chief executive of Uber are now advising Donald Trump |publisher= |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fortune.com/2016/12/14/donald-trump-musk-kalanick-nooyi/ |title=Donald Trump Adds Elon Musk, Travis Kalanick, and Indra Nooyi to His Team of Advisers |date=December 14, 2016 |publisher= |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OConnell"&gt;{{cite web |last1=OConnell |first1=Justin |title=Elon Musk, Appointed to Trump's Team of Advisories, Thinks Bitcoin Is a "Good Thing" - CryptoCoinsNews |url=https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/elon-musk-appointed-trumps-team-advisories-thinks-bitcoins-good-thing/ |website=CryptoCoinsNews |accessdate=April 16, 2017 |date=December 23, 2016}}&lt;!-- source indicates Musk's previous comments on alternative currency arrangements--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Manufacturing Jobs Initiative)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-selected-for-trumps-manufacturing-jobs-initiative-2017-1 |title=Elon Musk just got more involved with Trump's administration |author= |date= |work=businessinsider.com |accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but resigned from both in June 2017, in protest at Trump's decision to [[United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement|withdraw the United States]] from the [[Paris Agreement]] on climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-us-canada-40123293 |title=US quits Paris climate pact: Reaction from around the world following the US president's decision on the Paris accord |accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/870369915894546432 |title=Elon Musk anouncing departing presidential councils on Twitter |accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musk has described himself as "nauseatingly pro-American". According to Musk, the United States is "[inarguably] the greatest country that has ever existed on Earth," describing it as "the greatest force for good of any country that's ever been." Musk believes outright that there "would not be democracy in the world if not for the United States," arguing there were "three separate occasions in the 20th-century where democracy would have fallen with [[World War I]], [[World War II]] and the [[Cold War]], if not for the United States." Musk also stated that he thinks "it would be a mistake to say the United States is perfect, it certainly is not. There have been many foolish things the United States has done and bad things the United States has done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript1292.html |title=Elon Musk and the frontier of Technology |accessdate=June 12, 2015 |website=Think Tank |publisher=PBS.org |last=Wattenberg |first=Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prompted by the emergence of self-driving cars and artificial intelligence, Musk has voiced support for a universal [[basic income]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mashable.com/2016/11/05/elon-musk-universal-basic-income/ |title=Elon Musk thinks universal income is answer to automation taking human jobs |website=[[mashable.com]] |first=Adario |last=Strange |date=November 5, 2016 |accessdate=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the election of [[Donald Trump]] as [[President of the United States]], Musk criticized candidate Trump by saying: "I feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy. He doesn't seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.in/Elon-Musk-on-Trump-presidency-I-dont-think-hes-the-right-guy/articleshow/55251034.cms |title=Elon Musk on Trump presidency: 'I don't think he's the right guy' |author= |date= |work=businessinsider.in |accessdate=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Donald Trump's inauguration, Musk expressed approval of Trump's choice of [[Rex Tillerson]] as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising President Trump. Regarding his cooperation with Trump, Musk has subsequently commented: "The more voices of reason that the President hears, the better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-38753819 |title=Elon Musk: I'm Trump's voice of reason |work=[[BBC News]] |first=Dave |last=Lee |date=January 26, 2017 |accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lobbying===
In an interview with ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Musk stated he was a "significant (though not top-tier) donor to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]," but that he also gives heavily to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. Musk further stated, "in order to have your voice be heard in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], you have to make some little contribution."&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/20/elon-musk-spacex_n_2727312.html |title=Elon Musk, SpaceX Founder, Battles Entrenched Rivals Over NASA Contracts |work=The Huffington Post |accessdate=May 30, 2015 |date=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fightforvotes.com/obama-and-congress-at-odds-over-elon-musk |title=Obama and Congress at odds over Elon Musk |publisher=fightforvotes.com |accessdate=May 30, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530204604/http://www.fightforvotes.com/obama-and-congress-at-odds-over-elon-musk/ |archivedate=May 30, 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent report from the [[Sunlight Foundation]] (a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending), found that "[[SpaceX]] has spent over {{US$|4&amp;nbsp;million}} on [[lobbying]] [[United States Congress|Congress]] since it was established in 2002 and doled out more than {{US$|800,000}} in political contributions" to Democrats and Republicans. The same report noted that "SpaceX's campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated," and that "unlike most tech-startups, SpaceX has maintained a significant lobbying presence in Washington almost since day{{nbsp}}1." The report further noted that "Musk himself has donated roughly {{US$|725,000}} to various campaigns since 2002. In 2004, he contributed {{US$|2,000}} to President [[George W. Bush]]'s reelection campaign, maxing out (over {{US$|100,000}})&lt;ref&gt;Timothy P. Carney, [http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/carney-green-stimulus-profiteer-comes-under-irs-scrutiny/article/2510619 "Carney: Green stimulus profiteer comes under IRS scrutiny"], WashingtonExaminer.com, October 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Barack Obama]]'s reelection campaign and donated {{US$|5,000}} to Republican Sen. [[Marco Rubio]], who represents Florida, a state critical to the [[space industry]]. (...)

Alongside Patton Boggs LLP, SpaceX uses several other outside lobbying firms, who work with SpaceX's own lobbyists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-27/billionaires-battle-as-bezos-musk-companies-vie-for-launch-pad |title=Billionaires Battle as Bezos-Musk Companies Vie for Launch Pad |date=September 27, 2013 |accessdate=July 1, 2015 |website=Bloomberg.com |publisher=Bloomberg Business |last=Salant |first=Jonathan D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musk had been a supporter of the U.S. [[political action committee]] (PAC) [[FWD.us]], which was started by fellow high-profile entrepreneur [[Mark Zuckerberg]] and advocates for [[Immigration reform#United States|immigration reform]]. However, in May 2013, Musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the PAC was running that supported causes like the [[Keystone Pipeline]]. Musk and other members, including [[David O. Sacks]], pulled out, criticizing the strategy as "cynical."&lt;ref&gt;Steven Kovach, [http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-says-zuckerbergs-pac-cynical-2013-5 "Elon Musk Says He Quit Mark Zuckerberg's PAC Because It Was Too Cynical"], BusinessInsider.com, May 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Musk further stated, "we shouldn't give in to the politics. If we give in to that, we'll get the political system we deserve."&lt;ref name="mic.com2013"/&gt;

In December 2013, Sean Becker of the media/political website [[Mic (media company)|Mic]] called Musk a "complete hypocrite," stating that "[for] the 2014 election cycle, Musk has contributed to the Longhorn PAC and the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]  both of which have funded the campaigns of [[anti-science]], [[Anti-environmentalism|anti-environment]] candidates such as Rep. [[Michele Bachmann|Michelle Bachman]] (R-Minn.)."&lt;ref name="mic.com2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mic.com/articles/76165/elon-musk-donated-to-anti-science-republicans |title=Elon Musk Donated to Anti-Science Republicans |date=December 11, 2013 |accessdate=June 10, 2015 |website=[[Mic (media company)|Mic]] |publisher=Policy.Mic |last=Becker |first=Sean}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musk has directly contributed to Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding [[climate change]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

===Subsidies===
Musk has stated that he does not believe the U.S. government should provide [[subsidies]] to companies but should instead use a [[carbon tax]] to price in the negative [[externality]] of [[air pollution]] and discourage "bad behavior." Musk argues that the [[free market]] would achieve the "best solution," and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/564782/elon-musk-says-tax-free-carbon-is-the-dumbest-experiment-in-history/|title=Elon Musk says tax-free carbon is "the dumbest experiment in history"|last1=Werber|first1=Cassie|publisher=Quartz|accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musk's statements have been widely criticized, with [[Stanford University]] Professor [[Fred Turner (author)|Fred Turner]] noting that "if you're an entrepreneur like Elon Musk, you will take the money where you can get it, but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that it's entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of [[social change]], not the state. It is not quite self-delusion, but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a free-standing, independent agent, and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received. And this goes on all the time in Silicon Valley."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/10/tesla-motors-free-ride-elon-musk-government-subsidies|title=Taxpayer Subsidies Helped Tesla Motors, So Why Does Elon Musk Slam Them?|work=Mother Jones|accessdate=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Michael Shellenberger]] argued that "in the case of Musk, it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness. And I think there is a business reason for it. They are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a long-term viable business, and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent." Shellenberger continues, "we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful, a bit more humble." While journalist and author [[Jim Motavalli]], who interviewed Musk for ''High Voltage'', his 2011 book about the electric vehicle industry, speculated that "Elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner, and he doesn't want to see other people win because they get government money  I do think there is a tendency of people, once they have succeeded, to want to pull the ladder up after them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/10/tesla-motors-free-ride-elon-musk-government-subsidies?page=2|title=Taxpayer Subsidies Helped Tesla Motors, So Why Does Elon Musk Slam Them?|last=Harkinson|first=Josh|date=September 2013|work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Musk's statements were subject to further scrutiny when an ''[[LA Times]]'' article claimed that [[SpaceX]], Tesla, [[SolarCity]] and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated {{US$|4.9&amp;nbsp;billion}} in government subsidies over twenty years. One example given is New York state, which is spending $750&amp;nbsp;million to build a solar panel factory in Buffalo which will be leased to SolarCity for $1 a year. The deal also includes no property taxes for a decade, an estimated $260&amp;nbsp;million valuation. Musk employs a former U.S. State Department official as the chief negotiator for Tesla.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-musk-subsidies-20150531-story.html#page=1|title=Elon Musk's growing empire is fuelled by &amp;nbsp;billion in government subsidies|last=Hirsch|first=Jerry|date=May 30, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinions==
===Destiny and religion===
When asked whether he believed "there was some kind of [[destiny]] involved" in humanity's transition to a multi-planetary species, rather than "just physics," Musk responded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, I do. Do I think that there's some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff? I think probably not because then you have to say: "Where does the master intelligence come from?" So it sort of begs the question. So I think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics. You know it's complex phenomenon from simple elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oninnovation.com/videos/detail.aspx?video=1549&amp;title=Going+to+Mars |title=Going to Mars with Elon Musk |date=June 2008 |accessdate=June 10, 2015 |website=OnInnovation.com}}&lt;br/&gt;[https://www.thehenryford.org/explore/stories-of-innovation/visionaries/elon-musk/#gallery-video=JkNm43MToXXZ5r2zNap-Ixa5FkAkaILW Going To Mars] (alt link retrieved Feb 2, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Musk has stated that he does not pray, or worship any being, although previously admitted to praying before an important [[Falcon 1]] launch, asking "any entities that [were] listening" to "bless [the] launch." When asked whether he believed "religion and science could [[Relationship between religion and science|co-exist]]," Musk replied "probably not."&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/19/4122624/elon-musk-mars-colony-terraforming-spacex-video-rainn-wilson-metaphysical-milkshake |title=Elon Musk and Rainn Wilson discuss colonizing Mars, global warming, and the fear of failure |date=March 19, 2013 |accessdate=June 12, 2015 |website=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extraterrestrial life===
Although Musk believes "there is a good chance that there is simple life on other planets," he "questions whether there is other intelligent life in the known universe."&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; Musk later clarified his "hope that there is other intelligent life in the known universe," and stated that it is "probably more likely than not, but that's a complete guess."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3RlCVtQ6mA |title=Elon Musk, CEO and CTO, Space Exploration Technologies Corp (SpaceX), Peter Diamandis, CEO, X Prize Foundation and John Doerr, Venture Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musk has also considered the [[simulation hypothesis]] as a potential solution to the [[Fermi paradox]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation.... Like when you're playing an adventure game, and you can see the stars in the background, but you can't ever get there. If it's not a simulation, then maybe we're in a lab and there's some advanced alien civilization that's just watching how we develop, out of curiosity, like mould in a petri dish.... If you look at our current technology level, something strange has to happen to civilizations, and I mean strange in a bad way. ... And it could be that there are a whole lot of dead, one-planet civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/the-elon-musk-interview-on-mars |title=The Elon Musk Interview on Mars Colonization |date=September 30, 2014 |accessdate=June 10, 2015 |work=[[Aeon (digital magazine)|Aeon]] |last=Anderson |first=Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Artificial intelligence===
Musk has frequently spoken about the [[existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence|potential dangers]] of [[artificial intelligence]], declaring it "the most serious threat to the survival of the human race." During a 2014 interview at the [[MIT]] AeroAstro Centennial Symposium, Musk described AI as "[humanity's] biggest existential threat," further stating, "I'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don't do something very foolish." Musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as "summoning the demon".&lt;ref name="guardianAI"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/27/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-ai-biggest-existential-threat |title=Elon Musk: artificial intelligence is our biggest existential threat |first1=Samuel |last1=Gibbs |date=October 27, 2014 |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |accessdate=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wp2015&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/07/28/elon-musk-and-stephen-hawking-think-we-should-ban-killer-robots/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308074506/http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/07/28/elon-musk-and-stephen-hawking-think-we-should-ban-killer-robots/ |title=Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking think we should ban killer robots |date=July 28, 2015 |archivedate=March 8, 2016 |work=Washington Post |accessdate=January 5, 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, Musk has previously invested in [[DeepMind]], an AI firm, and [[Vicarious (Company)|Vicarious]], a company working to improve [[machine intelligence]]. In January 2015, he donated $10&amp;nbsp;million to the [[Future of Life Institute]], an organization focused on challenges posed by advanced technologies.&lt;ref name=bi2015&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-donates-10-million-to-the-future-of-life-institute-2015-1 |title=Elon Musk Is Donating Million To Keep Killer Robots From Taking Over The World |first1=Maya |last1=Kosoff |date=January 15, 2015 |publisher=''[[Business Insider]]'' |accessdate=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the co-chairman of [[OpenAI]], a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techinsider.io/elon-musk-just-announced-a-new-artificial-intelligence-research-company-2015-12 |title=Elon Musk just announced a new artificial intelligence research company |first1=Danielle |last1=Muoio |date=December 11, 2015 |publisher=Tech Insider |accessdate=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musk has said that his investments are, "not from the standpoint of actually trying to make any investment return... I like to just keep an eye on what's going on with artificial intelligence." Musk continued, "There have been movies about this, you know, like ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]''  there are some scary outcomes. And we should try to make sure the outcomes are good, not bad."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/18/elon-musk-deepmind-ai-tesla-motors |title=Elon Musk says he invested in DeepMind over 'Terminator' fears |last=Hern |first=Alex |date=June 18, 2014 |accessdate=June 10, 2015 |via=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, Musk was asked whether he thinks [[Simulated reality#Simulation argument|humans live in a computer simulation]], to which he answered:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation I think is the following: 40 years ago we had [[Pong]]  two rectangles and a dot. That's where we were. Now 40 years later we have photorealistic, 3D simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and it's getting better every year. And soon we'll have virtual reality, we'll have augmented reality. If you assume any rate of improvement at all, then the games will become indistinguishable from reality, just indistinguishable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/elon-musk-ai-artificial-intelligence-computer-simulation-gaming-virtual-reality-a7060941.html |title=We are living in a computer simulation, Elon Musk says |date=June 2, 2016 |publisher=The Independent |language=en-GB |access-date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elon Musk's dark warnings over Artificial Intelligence has brought him some controversy. He and [[Facebook]] founder [[Mark Zuckerberg]] have clashed with the latter terming his warnings "irresponsible". Musk responded to Mark's censure by saying that he had discussed AI with Zuckerberg and found him to have only a "limited understanding" of the subject. In 2014 [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'s Adam Elkus argued "our 'smartest' AI is about as intelligent as a toddlerand only when it comes to instrumental tasks like information recall. Most roboticists are still trying to get a robot hand to pick up a ball or run around without falling over." Elkus goes on to argue that Musk's "summoning the demon" analogy may be harmful because it could result in "harsh cuts" to AI research budgets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elkus|first1=Adam|title=Dont Fear Artificial Intelligence|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/10/elon_musk_artificial_intelligence_why_you_shouldn_t_be_afraid_of_ai.html|accessdate=May 15, 2016|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=October 31, 2014|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Information Technology and Innovation Foundation]] (ITIF), a Washington D.C. think-tank, awarded its Annual Luddite Award to "alarmists touting an artificial intelligence apocalypse"; its president, [[Robert D. Atkinson]], complained that Musk and others say AI is the largest existential threat to humanity. Atkinson stated "That's not a very winning message if you want to get AI funding out of Congress to the National Science Foundation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://itif.org/publications/2016/01/19/artificial-intelligence-alarmists-win-itif%E2%80%99s-annual-luddite-award Artificial Intelligence Alarmists Win ITIFs Annual Luddite Award], ITIF Website, January 19, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Artificial intelligence alarmists' like Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking win 'Luddite of the Year' award|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/elon-musk-stephen-hawking-luddite-award-of-the-year-itif-a6821921.html|accessdate=February 25, 2018|work=[[The Independent (UK)]]|date=January 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Price|first1=Emily|title=Elon Musk nominated for 'luddite' of the year prize over artificial intelligence fears|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/24/elon-musk-nominated-for-luddite-of-the-year-prize-over-artificial-intelligence-fears|accessdate=February 25, 2018|date=December 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' sharply disagreed with the ITIF in an April 2016 editorial, siding instead with Musk, and concluding: "It is crucial that progress in technology is matched by solid, well-funded research to anticipate the scenarios it could bring about...

===Public transport===
At a Tesla event on the sidelines of the [[Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems]] in December 2017, Musk stated that:&lt;blockquote&gt;I think public transport is painful. It sucks. Why do you want to get on something with a lot of other people, that doesnt leave where you want it to leave, doesnt start where you want it to start, doesnt end where you want it to end? And it doesnt go all the time. [...] Its a pain in the ass. Thats why everyone doesnt like it. And theres like a bunch of random strangers, one of who might be a serial killer, OK, great.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/39433-elon-musk-sparks-heated-twitter-debate-over-boring-company-s-vision|title=Elon Musk Sparks Heated Twitter Debate Over Boring Company's Vision|last=Brown|first=Mike|date=15 Dec 2017|work=Inverse|access-date=December 23, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Afterwards, he dismissed an audience members response that public transportation functioned effectively in Japan.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/dec/21/elon-musk-public-transport-transit-painful-twitter|title='I met my wife on a train platform': Twitter responds to Elon Musk with positive public transport stories|last=Hunt|first=Elle|date=December 21, 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=December 23, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-awkward-dislike-mass-transit/|title=Elon Musk Really Doesn't Like Mass Transit Systems He's Trying to Build|last=Marshall|first=Aarian|date=December 14, 2017|work=WIRED|access-date=December 23, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His comment sparked widespread criticism from both the public and transit experts. Urban planning expert Brent Toderian started the hashtag #GreatThingsThatHappenedonTransit which was widely adopted by Twitter users in order to dispel Musk's notion that everybody hated public transport.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BrentToderian/status/942967831833993218|title=Elon Musk may say bad things about public transit, but I asked Twitter to share their #GreatThingsThatHappenedOnTransit!

Jarrett Walker, a known public transport expert and consultant from [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], said that "Musk's hatred of sharing space with strangers is a luxury (or pathology) that only the rich can afford," referring to the theory that planning a city around the preferences&amp;nbsp;of a minority yields&amp;nbsp;an outcome that usually does not work for the majority.&lt;ref name=wired20171216/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/humantransit/status/941386665519595521|title=In cities, @elonmusk's hatred of sharing space with strangers is a luxury (or pathology) that only the rich can afford.

Also in 2016, Musk was referenced by [[Firestorm (comics)#Live-action|Dr. Martin Stein]] on [[The CW]] time-travel TV show ''[[Legends of Tomorrow|DC's Legends of Tomorrow]]''. During [[time travel]] to the past, Stein meets his younger self and introduced himself as Elon Musk, to disguise his own identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://observer.com/2016/01/dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-power-rankings-week-2-burn-baby-burn |title='DC's Legends of Tomorrow' Power Rankings, Week 2: Burn, Baby, Burn  Observer |date=January 29, 2016 |work=Observer |accessdate=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, Musk was prematurely immortalized as a historic pioneer on the [[CBS All Access]] series ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]''.

According to an article in techcrunch.com published the day after the episode aired, this mention is "also interesting because of its notable omission of Amazon and [[Blue Origin]] founder [[Jeff Bezos]]: This other space entrepreneur is such a big fan of Star Trek that he pitched and succeeded in landing a cameo in [[Star Trek Beyond]] as an alien being, but he doesnt rate a mention from Lorca among the spaceflight pantheon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Etherington|first1=Darrell|title=Elon Musk gets a nod as a space pioneer from Star Trek: Discovery|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/09/elon-musk-gets-a-nod-as-a-space-pioneer-from-star-trek-discovery/|website=Techcrunch.com|publisher=Tech Crunch|accessdate=October 13, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013134811/https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/09/elon-musk-gets-a-nod-as-a-space-pioneer-from-star-trek-discovery/|archivedate=October 13, 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The successful first landing of a [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon 9]] first stage on a [[Autonomous spaceport drone ship|drone ship]] on April 8, 2016, is shown being covered by [[CNN]]. This is followed by a scene where Musk is shown alone in his office reading the notebook that young Sheldon mailed [[NASA]] in 1989 (a scene shown earlier in the episode) containing calculations detailing how this feat could be accomplished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Tyler|title=Young Sheldon Episode 6 recap: Sheldon discovers physics|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/30/young-sheldon-episode-6-recap-sheldon-discovers-physics.html|website=Foxnews.com|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=December 1, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031538/http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/30/young-sheldon-episode-6-recap-sheldon-discovers-physics.html|archivedate=December 1, 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
