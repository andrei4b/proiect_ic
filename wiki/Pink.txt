'''Pink''' is a pale red color that is named after a [[Pink (flower)|flower of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;''Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', 5th Edition, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Webster New World Dictionary'', Third College Edition: "Any of a genus (''Dianthus'') of annual and perennial plants of the pink family with white, pink or red flowers.; its pale red color."&lt;/ref&gt; It was first used as a color name in the late 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;"pink, ''n.'' and ''adj.''", [[Oxford English Dictionary]] Online&lt;/ref&gt; According to surveys in Europe and the United States, pink is the color most often associated with charm, politeness, sensitivity, tenderness, sweetness, childhood, femininity and the romantic. It is associated with chastity and innocence when combined with [[white]], but associated with eroticism and seduction when combined with [[purple]] or [[black]].&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Eva: ''Psychologie de la couleur  effets et symboliques'', pp. 179-184&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and definitions ==
The color pink is named after the flowers, [[Dianthus plumarius|pinks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.monticello.org/site/house-and-gardens/pinks-gilliflowers-carnations-exalted-flowers|title=Pinks,  Gilliflowers, &amp; Carnations -- The Exalted Flowers {{!}} Thomas Jefferson's Monticello|last=Cornett|first=Peggy|date=January 1998|website=www.monticello.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[flowering plant]]s in the genus ''[[Dianthus]],'' and derives from the frilled edge of the flowers. The [[verb]] "to pink" dates from the 14th century and means "to decorate with a perforated or punched pattern" (possibly from German ''pinken'', "to peck").&lt;ref&gt;Collins Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

While the word "pink" was first used as a noun to refer to a color in the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-history-pink|title=A Brief History of the Color Pink|last=Bucknell|first=Alice|date=2017-11-06|work=Artsy|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the verb "pink" continues to be reflected today as the name of hand-held scissors that cut a zig-zagged line to prevent fraying that are referred to as [[pinking shears]].

== History, art and fashion ==
The color pink has been described in literature since ancient times. In the [[Odyssey]], written in approximately 800&amp;nbsp;BCE, [[Homer]] wrote "Then, when the child of morning, [[Eos|rosy-fingered dawn]] appeared..."&lt;ref&gt;The Odyssey, Book XII, translated by Samuel Butler.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman poets also described the color. ''[[wikt:roseus|Roseus]]'' is the [[Latin]] word meaning "[[Rose (color)|rosy]]" or "pink." [[Lucretius]] used the word to describe the [[dawn]] in his [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] ''On the Nature of Things'' (''[[De rerum natura]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ablemedia.com/ctcweb/glossary/glossaryr.html |title=CTCWeb Glossary: R (ratis to ruta) |publisher=Ablemedia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pink was not a common color in the fashion of the Middle Ages; nobles usually preferred brighter reds, such as crimson. However, it did appear in women's fashion, and in religious art. In the 13th and 14th century, in works by [[Cimabue]] and [[Duccio]], the Christ child was sometimes portrayed dressed in pink, the color associated with the body of Christ.

In the high Renaissance painting the [[Madonna of the Pinks]] by [[Raphael]], the Christ child is presenting a [[pink (flower)|pink flower]] to the [[Virgin Mary]]. The pink was a symbol of marriage, showing a spiritual marriage between the mother and child.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG6596 ''The Madonna of the Pinks'' on the official National Gallery website&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Renaissance, pink was mainly used for the flesh color of faces and hands. The pigment commonly used for this was called light cinabrese; it was a mixture of the red earth pigment called [[sinopia]], or [[Venetian red]], and a white pigment called ''Bianco San Genovese'', or lime white. In his famous 15th century manual on painting, ''Il Libro Dell'Arte'', [[Cennino Cennini]] described it this way: "This pigment is made from the loveliest and lightest sinopia that is found and is mixed and mulled with St. Johns white, as it is called in Florence; and this white is made from thoroughly white and thoroughly purified lime. And when these two pigments have been thoroughly mulled together (that is, two parts cinabrese and the third white), make little loaves of them like half walnuts and leave them to dry. When you need some, take however much of it seems appropriate. And this pigment does you great credit if you use it for painting faces, hands and nudes on walls..."&lt;ref&gt;Lara Broecke, ''Cennino Cennini's ''Il Libro dell'Arte'': a New English Translation and Commentary with Italian Transcription'', Archetype 2015, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century===

The zenith of the color pink was the 18th century, when pastel colors became very fashionable in all the courts of Europe. Pink was particularly championed by [[Madame de Pompadour]] (17211764), the mistress of King [[Louis XV of France]], who wore combinations of pale blue and pink, and had a particular tint of pink made for her by the [[Sevres porcelain]] factory, created by adding nuances of blue, black and yellow.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur, effets et symboliques'', pp. 182-83&lt;/ref&gt;

While pink was quite evidently the color of seduction in the portraits made by [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]] of [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]], the future mistress of Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]], in the late 18th century, it had the completely opposite meaning in the portrait of Sarah Barrett Moulton painted by [[Thomas Lawrence]] in 1794. In this painting, it symbolized childhood, innocence and tenderness. Sarah Moulton was just eleven years old when the picture was painted, and died the following year.
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="150px"&gt;
File:Pompadour6.jpg|[[Madame de Pompadour]], the mistress of [[Louis XV of France]], made pink and blue the leading fashion colors in the Court of Versailles. She had a special pink tint created for her by the Sevres porcelain factory. This portrait by [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]] was painted between 1748 and 1755.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===19th century===

In 19th century England, pink ribbons or decorations were often worn by young boys; boys were simply considered small men, and while men in England wore red uniforms, boys wore pink. In fact the clothing for children in the 19th century was almost always white, since, before the invention of chemical dyes, clothing of any color would quickly fade when washed in boiling water. Queen Victoria was painted in 1850 with her seventh child and third son, Prince Arthur, who wore white and pink. In late nineteenth-century France, Impressionist painters working in a pastel color palette sometimes depicted women wearing the color pink, such as [[Edgar Degas]] image of ballet dancers or [[Mary Cassatt]]s images of women and children.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== 20th century - present ===

In the 20th century, pinks became bolder, brighter, and more assertive, in part because of the invention of chemical dyes which did not fade. The pioneer in the creation of the new wave of pinks was the Italian designer [[Elsa Schiaparelli]], (1890-1973) who was aligned with the artists of the [[surrealist]] movement, including [[Jean Cocteau]]. In 1931 she created a new variety of the color, called [[shocking pink]], made by mixing [[magenta]] with a small amount of white. She launched a perfume called Shocking, sold in a bottle in the shape of a woman's torso, said to be modelled on that of [[Mae West]]. Her fashions, co-designed with artists such as Cocteau, featured the new pinks.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur - effets et symboliques'', p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Nazi Germany]] in the 1930s and 1940s, inmates of [[Nazi concentration camps]] who were accused of [[homosexuality]] were forced to wear a [[pink triangle]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Pink Triangle: The Nazi War Against Homosexuals'' (1986) by Richard Plant (New Republic Books). {{ISBN|0-8050-0600-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the pink triangle has become a symbol of the modern [[gay rights movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCormick|first1=Joseph Patrick|title=Nick Clegg calls for gay victims of the Nazis to be remembered in national Holocaust memorial|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/01/27/nick-clegg-calls-for-gay-victims-of-the-nazis-to-be-remembered-in-national-holocaust-memorial/|website=Pink Triangle|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transition to pink as a sexually differentiating color for girls occurred gradually, through the selective process of the marketplace, in the 1930s and 40s. In the 1920s, some groups had been describing pink as a masculine color, an equivalent of the red that was considered to be for men, but lighter for boys. But stores nonetheless found that people were increasingly choosing to buy pink for girls, and blue for boys, until this became an accepted norm in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;''Smithsonian Magazine''&lt;br/&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/when-did-girls-start-wearing-pink-1370097/?no-ist When Did Girls Start Wearing Pink?]&lt;br/&gt;In 1927, ''Time'' magazine printed a chart showing sex-appropriate colors for girls and boys according to leading U.S. stores. In Boston, Filenes told parents to dress boys in pink. So did Best &amp; Co. in New York City, Halles in Cleveland and Marshall Field in Chicago.&lt;P&gt;Todays color dictate wasnt established until the 1940s, as a result of Americans preferences as interpreted by manufacturers and retailers. It could have gone the other way&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="npr-pink"&gt;{{cite web |title=Girls Are Taught To 'Think Pink,' But That Wasn't Always So |last1=Stamberg |first1=Susan  |date=April 1, 2014 |website=npr.org |publisher=[[NPR]] |accessdate=2014-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415154701/http://www.npr.org/2014/04/01/297159948/girls-are-taught-to-think-pink-but-that-wasnt-always-so |archivedate=2014-04-15 |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/04/01/297159948/girls-are-taught-to-think-pink-but-that-wasnt-always-so |quote=a 1918 trade catalog for children's clothing recommended blue for girls.

[[File:mamie eisenhower.gif|thumb|90px|Mamie Eisenhower in her pink inaugural gown, painted in 1953 by Thomas Stevens]]
The US presidential inauguration of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in 1953 when Eisenhower's wife [[Mamie Eisenhower]] wore a pink dress as her inaugural gown is thought to have been a key turning point to the association of pink as a color associated with girls. Mamie's strong liking of pink led to the public association with pink being a color that "ladylike women wear." The 1957 American musical [[Funny Face]] also played a role in cementing the color's association with women.&lt;ref name="Voxpink"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaGSYGhUkvM | title=How did pink become a girly color? | publisher=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] | date=14 April 2015 | accessdate=9 August 2015 | author=Jennifer Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author of ''Pink Think'', Lynn Peril, has dubbed the 1960s Hollywood moviestar [[Jayne Mansfield]] The Patron Saint of Pink Think.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons|last=Peril|first=Lynn|publisher=W.

Contemporary artists, museums, and publications frequently include the color pink in their work and exhibitions. The Turkish artist [[Tomur Atagk]] references Ingres ''[[Grande Odalisque|La Grande Odalisque]]'' in her ''Hommage to Ingres I'' and ''II'' (1985), as well as ancient Egyptian art in ''Artemis of Ephesus'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tomuratagok.com/kadin.php?l=en|title=Gender Issues, 1981-|last=Atagk|first=Tomur|date=|website=|access-date=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other female artists who use pink include [[Sylvie Fleury]], whose installations such as ''First Spaceship on Venus'' (1996) offer critiques of pink in consumer culture, and [[Louise Bourgeois]], whose ''Nature Study'' series uses pink to suggest flesh tones in sculptural forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pink: The Exposed Color in Contemporary Art and Culture|last=Nemitz|first=Barbara|publisher=Hatje Cantz ; D.A.P.|year=2006|isbn=|location=Ostfildern; New York|pages=7172}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pink Project: Table'' is an installation piece by [[Portia Munson]] that has been showcased at the New Museum, New York, as a part of the Bad Girls Exhibition in 1994, and at the Frieze in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phaidon.com/agenda/art/articles/2016/october/06/the-story-behind-that-pink-table-at-frieze/|title=The story behind that pink table at Frieze|last=|first=|date=|website=Phaidon|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The installation consists of a four meter long table covered in Munsons collection of pink consumer items, most from the late-20th century. Munson started her collection in the 1980s out of pure appreciation of the color while also trying to keep in mind consumerism, the gender roles played by colors such as pink and blue, and the human need to collect and discard.

Many of [[Franz West]]'s [[aluminium]] sculptures were often painted a bright pink, for example ''Sexualittssymbol (Symbol of Sexuality).'' West has said that the pink was intended as an "outcry to nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.hatjecantz.de/pink-1718-1.html|title=Pink The Exposed Color in Contemporary Art and Culture|last1=Nemitz|first1=Barbara|publisher=Hatje Cantz|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1972 ''[[Womanhouse]]'' art installation run by [[Judy Chicago]] and [[Miriam Schapiro]] with the Feminist Art Program at the California Institute of the Arts included a kitchen painted completely in a store-bought pink.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schapiro|first=Miriam|date=Spring 1972|title=The Education of Women as Artists: Project Womanhouse|jstor=775513|journal=Art Journal|volume=31| issue =  2|pages=268270}}&lt;/ref&gt; The room was designed by Robin Weltsch and Susan Frazier with Vicki Hodgetts ''Eggs to Breasts'' motifs attached to its walls. According to Schapiro, the room intended to evoke ideas of maternity and domesticity by using pink as a consciousness-raising motif.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The next year, in 1973, [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]] created "Pink," a [[Broadside (printing)|broadside]] (poster) meant to explore the notions of gender as associated with the color pink, for an American Institute of Graphic Arts exhibition about color. This was the only entry about the color pink. Various women including many in the Feminist Studio Workshop at the [[Woman's Building]] submitted entries exploring their association with the color. De Bretteville arranged the squares of paper to form a "quilt" from which posters were printed and disseminated throughout Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moca.org/wack/?p=276 |title=WACK!

In 2005, the international exhibition ''Rosa  The Exposed Color: Pink'' opened at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pink : the exposed color in contemporary art and culture|last=Nemitz|first=Barbara|publisher=Hatje Cantz ; D.A.P.|year=2006|isbn=|location=Ostfildern; New York|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; From October, 2013  March, 2014, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, held an exhibition entitled ''Think Pink'' to coincide with Breast Cancer Awareness Month that October.

''Pink: The Exposed Color in Contemporary Art and Culture'' is a book published in 2006 by Barbara Nemitz in collaboration with Hideto Fuse, Karl Schawelka, and Thomas von Taschitzki.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pink: The Exposed Color in Contemporary Art|last=Nemitz|first=Barbara|publisher=Hatje Cantz; D.A.P.|year=2006|isbn=|location=Ostfildern; New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the images used in the book were collected by Nemitz over more than 20 years, starting in the late eighties, after she realized the effect that pink had on viewers of her own work. The images chosen showcase the different ways that pink has been used in advertising, fashion, artwork, and everyday life. The book is broken up into sections, each with the writings of a different collaborator who speaks on pink in relation to their life and research. Karl Schawelka writes on pink in relation to biology, sexuality, and its cultural relevance around the world. Hideto Fuse sheds light onto pinks role in Japanese art and culture. Thomas von Taschitzki also gives an overview of the use of pink in contemporary art, followed by a large collection of images of works by contemporary artists such as: Willem de Kooning, Louise Bourgeois, Takashi Murakami, and Paul Gauguin.

== Science and nature ==
=== Optics ===
Red is the only color whose lighter shades have a different name, pink, than the color itself. In optics, the word "pink" can refer to any of the pale shades of colors between [[blue|bluish]] [[red]] to red in hue, of medium to high lightness, and of low to moderate [[saturation (color)|saturation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pink?show=2&amp;t=1323575657 |title=Merriam Webster definition of the color "pink" |publisher=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although pink is generally considered a [[tints and shades|tint]] of red,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landscape-guide.com/garden-design-guide/color-in-the-garden/pink-a-tint-of-red.php |title=Pink, a Tint of Red |publisher=Landscape-guide.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enchantedlearning.com/crafts/Colormixing.shtml |title=For example, pink is a tint of red |publisher=Enchantedlearning.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; the hues of most [[shades of pink]] are slightly bluish, and lie between red and [[magenta]].

===Why sunrises and sunsets sometimes look pink===
As a ray of white sunlight travels through the atmosphere, some of the colors are scattered out of the beam by air molecules and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particles]]. This is called [[Rayleigh scattering]]. Colors with a shorter wavelength, such as blue and green, scatter more strongly, and are removed from the light that finally reaches the eye.&lt;ref name=saha&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]], when the path of the sunlight through the atmosphere to the eye is longest, the blue and green components are removed almost completely, leaving the longer wavelength orange, red and pink light. The remaining pinkish sunlight can also be scattered by cloud droplets and other relatively large particles, which give the sky above the horizon a pink or reddish glow.&lt;ref name=guenther&gt;{{cite book

===Why cooked beef, cured ham, steamed shrimp and salmon are pink===
Raw [[beef]] is red, because the muscles of [[vertebrate]] animals, such as cows and pigs, contain a [[protein]] called [[myoglobin]], which binds oxygen and [[iron]] atoms. When beef is cooked, the myoglobin proteins undergo oxidation, and gradually turn from red to pink to brown; that is, from rare to medium to well-done. Pork contains less myoglobin than beef and therefore is less red; when heated, it changes from pinkish-red to less pink to tan or white.

[[Ham]], though it contains myoglobins like beef, undergoes a different transformation. Traditional hams, such as [[prosciutto]], are made by taking the hind leg or thigh of a pig, covering it with sea salt, which removes the moisture content, and then letting it dry or cure for as long as two years. The salt ([[sodium nitrate]]) permits the ham to retain its original pink color, even when dried out. Supermarket hams are made by a different and faster process; they are brined, or infused with a salt-water solution, containing [[sodium nitrite]], which transfers [[nitric oxide]], which bonds with the myoglobin to form the traditional pink cured ham color.

The shells and flesh of [[crustacean]]s such as [[crab]]s, [[lobster]]s and [[shrimp]] contain a pink [[carotenoid]] pigment called [[astaxanthin]]. Their shells, naturally blue-green, turn pink or red when cooked. The flesh of the [[salmon]] also contains astaxanthins, which makes it pink. Farm-bred salmon are sometimes fed these pigments to improve their pinkness, and it is sometimes also used to enhance the color of [[egg yolk]]s.

File:NCI steamed shrimp.jpg|The shells and flesh of steamed [[shrimp]] contain a natural [[carotenoid]] pigment called [[astaxanthin]], which turns pink when heated. The same process turns cooked lobster and crab from blue-green to red when they are boiled.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Plants and flowers===
Pink is one of the most common colors of flowers; it serves to attract the insects and birds necessary for [[pollination]] and perhaps also to deter predators. The color comes from natural pigments called [[anthocyanins]], which also provide the pink in [[raspberries]].

=== Pigments - Pinke ===
{{Main|Pinke (color)}}
In the 17th century, the word ''pink'' or ''pinke'' was also used to describe a yellowish pigment, which was mixed with blue colors to yield greenish colors. [[Thomas Jenner (publisher)|Thomas Jenner]]'s ''A Book of Drawing, Limning, Washing'' (1652) categorizes "Pink &amp; [[Blue|blew]] [[bice]]" amongst the [[green]]s (p. &amp;nbsp;38),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenner|first=Thomas |title=A Book of Drawing, Limning, Washing|publisher=M. Simmons |location=London |year=1652 |page=38 |url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupid?key=olbp20532}}&lt;/ref&gt; and specifies several admixtures of greenish colors made with pinke.g. "Grasse-green is made of Pink and Bice, it is shadowed with [[Indigo]] and Pink  French-green of Pink and Indico [shadowed with] Indico" (pp.&amp;nbsp;3840). In [[William Salmon]]'s ''Polygraphice'' (1673), "Pink yellow" is mentioned amongst the chief [[yellow]] pigments (p.&amp;nbsp;96), and the reader is instructed to mix it with either [[Saffron (color)|Saffron]] or [[Venetian ceruse|Ceruse]] for "sad" or "light" shades thereof, respectively.

=== Sonics ===
* [[Pink noise]] ({{Audio|Pink noise.ogg|sample}}), also known as 1/f noise, in [[audio engineering]] is a signal or process with a frequency spectrum such that the power spectral density is proportional to the reciprocal of the frequency.

=== Lighting ===
*[[Grow light]]s often use a combination of red and blue wavelengths, which generally appear pink to the human eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://inhabitat.com/indoor-vertical-farm-pinkhouses-grow-plants-faster-with-less-energy/ | title=Indoor Vertical Farm Pinkhouses Grow Plants Faster With Less Energy | work=Inhabitat | accessdate=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pink [[neon sign]]s are generally produced using one of two different methods. One method is to use neon gas and a blue or purple phosphor, which generally produces a warmer (more reddish) or more intense shade of pink. Another method is to use an argon/mercury blend and a red phosphor, which generally produces a cooler (more purplish) or softer shade of pink.
*Pink [[LED]]s can be produced using two methods, either with a blue LED using two phosphors (yellow for the first phosphor, and red, orange, or pink for the second), or by placing a pink dye on top of a white LED. Color shifting was a common issue with early pink LEDs, where the red, orange, or pink phosphors or dyes faded over time, causing the pink color to eventually shift towards white or blue. These issues have been mitigated by the more recent introduction of more fade-resistant phosphors.

=== Engineering ===
*Insulation manufactured by [[Owens Corning]] is dyed pink, with the [[Pink Panther (character)|Pink Panther]] as its corporate mascot. The company holds a trademark on the color pink for insulation products in order to prevent competitors from using it, and is the first company in the United States to trademark a color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.colormatters.com/color-and-marketing/color-branding-legal-rights | title=Color Branding &amp; Trademark Rights | work=Color Matters | accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The United States [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]] specifies fluorescent pink as an optional color for [[traffic sign]]s used for [[incident management]] as an alternative to the traditional orange in order to distinguish them from construction zone signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009/part6/part6f.htm | title=MUTCD 2009 Edition Chapter 6F.

== Pink in symbolism and culture ==

===Common associations and popularity===
According to public opinion surveys in Europe and the United States, pink is the color most associated with charm, politeness, sensitivity, tenderness, sweetness, softness, childhood, the feminine, and the romantic.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, Psychologie de la couleur - effets et symboliques, p. 179-185&lt;/ref&gt; Although it did not have any strong negative associations in these surveys, few respondents chose pink as their favorite color. Pink was the favorite color of only two-percent of respondents, compared with forty-five-percent who chose blue.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, Psychologie de la couleur - effets et symboliques, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Pink was the least-favorite color of seventeen percent of respondents; the only color more disliked was brown, with twenty percent. There was a notable difference between men and women; three percent of women chose pink as their favorite color, compared with less than one percent of men. Many of the men surveyed were unable to even identify pink correctly, confusing it with [[mauve]]. Pink was also more popular with older people than younger; twenty-five percent of women under twenty-five called pink their least favorite color, compared with only eight percent of women over fifty. Twenty-nine percent of men under the age of twenty-five said pink was their least favorite color, compared with eight percent of men over fifty.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, Psychologie de la couleur - effets et symboliques, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, pink is the color most commonly associated with [[spring (season)|springtime]] due to the blooming cherry blossoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://threads.srithreads.com/2011/04/spring-is-pink/ | title=Spring is Pink | work=SRI Threads | date=April 4, 2011 | accessdate=January 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.calvin-c.com/blog/season-colour/ | title=Season Colour  I Think Spring is Green | work=Calvin-C.com | accessdate=February 17, 2016 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306214652/http://www.calvin-c.com/blog/season-colour/ | archivedate=March 6, 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is different from surveys in the United States and Europe where [[green]] is the color most associated with springtime.

===Pink in other languages===
In many languages, the word for the color pink is based on the name of the [[rose]] flower; like ''rose'' in French; ''roze'' in Dutch; ''rosa'' in German, Latin, Portuguese, Catalan, Spanish, Italian, Swedish and Norwegian (Nynorsk and Bokml); ''rozoviy'' in Russian; ''rowy'' in Polish; and {{nastaliq|}} ''gulabi'' in Urdu (and in English 'rose', too, often refers to both the flower and the color).

In Danish, Faroese and Finnish, the color pink is described as a lighter shade of red: ''lyserd'' in Danish, ''ljsareyur'' in Faroese and ''vaaleanpunainen'' in Finnish, all meaning "light red". In Icelandic, the color is called ''bleikur'', originally meaning "pale".

In the Japanese language, the traditional word for pink, {{nihongo|'''''momo-iro'''''|}}, takes its name from the peach blossom. There is a separate word for the color of the cherry blossom: ''sakura-iro''. In recent times a word based on the English version, {{nihongo|'''''pinku'''''|}}, has begun to be used.

In Chinese, the color pink is named with a compound noun '''', meaning "powder red" where the powder refers to substances used for women's make-up.

===Idioms and expressions===
* '''In the pink'''. To be in top form, in good health, in good condition. In Romeo and Juliet, Mercutio says; "I am the very pink of courtesy." Romeo: Pink for flower? Mercutio: Right. Romeo: Then my pump is well flowered."&lt;ref&gt;Romeo and Juliet, Act 2, Scene 4&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''To see pink elephants''' means to hallucinate from alcoholism. The expression was used by American novelist [[Jack London]] in his book ''John Barleycorn'' in 1913.
* '''[[Pink slip (employment)|Pink slip]]'''. To be given a pink slip means to be fired or dismissed from a job. It was first recorded in 1915 in the United States.
* The phrase "[[pink-collar worker]]" refers to persons working in jobs conventionally regarded as "[[women's work]]."
* [[Pink money]], ''the pink pound'' or ''pink dollar'' is an economic term which refers to the spending power of the [[LGBT]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securian.com/pdf/Opportunities2005.pdf |title=Opportunities in the Pink Economy of the United Kingdom |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327012858/http://www.securian.com/pdf/Opportunities2005.pdf |archivedate=March 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Advertising]] agencies sometimes call the gay market the ''pink economy''.
* '''Tickled pink''' means extremely pleased.

===Architecture===
Early pink buildings were usually built of brick or [[sandstone]], which takes its pale red color from hematite, or iron ore. In the 18th century - the golden age of pink and other pastel colors - pink mansions and churches were built all across Europe. More modern pink buildings usually use the color pink to appear exotic or to attract attention.

=== Food and beverages ===
According to surveys in Europe and the United States, pink is the color most associated with sweet foods and beverages. Pink is also one of the few colors to be strongly associated with a particular aroma, that of roses.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur  effets et symboliques''&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[strawberry]] and [[raspberry]]-flavored foods are colored pink and light red as well, sometimes to distinguish them from [[cherry]]-flavored foods that are more commonly colored dark red (although raspberry-flavored foods, particularly in the United States, are often colored blue as well). The drink [[Tab (soft drink)|Tab]] was packaged in pink cans, presumably to subconsciously convey a sweet taste.

The pink color in most packaged and processed foods, ice creams, candies and pastries is made with artificial [[food coloring]]. The most common pink food coloring is [[erythrosine]], also known as Red No. 3, an [[organoiodine compound]], a derivative of [[fluorone]], which is a cherry-pink synthetic.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Phyllis A. Lyday "Iodine and Iodine Compounds" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually listed on package labels as E-127. Another common red or pink (particularly in the United States where erythrosine is less frequently used) is [[Allura Red AC]] (E-129), also known as Red No. 40. Some products use a natural red or pink food coloring, [[Cochineal]], also called [[carmine]], made with crushed insects of the family [[Dactylopius coccus]].

=== Gender ===
{{see also|List of historical sources for pink and blue as gender signifiers}}
[[File:ANAB767300Restroomsign.jpg|thumb|This restroom sign on an [[All Nippon Airways]] Boeing 767-300 uses pink for the female gender]]
In Europe and the United States, pink is often associated with girls, while blue is associated with boys. These colors were first used as [[gender]] signifiers just prior to World War I (for either girls or boys), and pink was first established as a female gender signifier in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Jo B.

Orenstein writes: "When colors were first introduced to the nursery in the early part of the 20th century, pink was considered the more masculine hue, a pastel version of red. Blue, with its intimations of the Virgin Mary, constancy and faithfulness, was thought to be dainty. Why or when that switched is not clear, but as late as the 1930s a significant percentage of adults in one national survey held to that split."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stepinsidedesign.com/STEPMagazine/Article/28832 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080228111428/http://www.stepinsidedesign.com/STEPMagazine/Article/28832 | archivedate = 2008-02-28 | title = Pink is for Boys: cultural history of the color pink | author = Jude Stewart| work = Step Inside Design Magazine | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kimmell, Michael. ''Manhood in America: A Cultural History'', 1996, The Free Press. p.158&lt;/ref&gt; have noted the contrary association of pink with boys in 20th-century America. An article in the trade publication ''Earnshaw's Infants' Department'' in June 1918 said:
&lt;!--Do not edit this quote.  References confirm the quote was stated as written, with pink for boys and blue for girls. --&gt;
{{quote|The generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls.  The reason is that pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.|sign=|source=}}

One reason for the increased use of pink for girls and blue for boys was the invention of new chemical dyes, which meant that children's clothing could be mass-produced and washed in hot water without fading. Prior to this time, most small children of both sexes wore white, which could be frequently washed.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur''; effets et symboliques.&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor was the popularity of blue and white sailor suits for young boys, a fashion that started in the late 19th century. Blue was also the usual color of school uniforms, for boys and girls. Blue was associated with seriousness and study, while pink was associated with childhood and softness.

By the 1950s, pink was strongly associated with femininity but to an extent that was "neither rigid nor universal" as it later became.&lt;ref&gt;Paoletti, 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/aug/25/genderissues | title = Bad Science | author = Ben Goldacre | work = Out of the Blue and into the Pink| location=London | date=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Zucker, Kenneth J. |author2=Bradley, Susan J. |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Gender Identity Disorder and Psychosexual Problems in Children and Adolescents | publisher = Guilford Press | year = 1995 | location = | page = 203 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=atfTHGjjVeIC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;vq=pink+or+blue&amp;sig=9wAt47m2KdAGR6QQ7BOwIkMa_-E | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-89862-266-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study by two neuroscientists in ''Current Biology'' examined color preferences across cultures and found significant differences between male and female responses. Both groups favored blues over other hues, but women had more favorable responses to the reddish-purple range of the spectrum and men had more favorable responses to the greenish-yellow middle of the spectrum. Despite the fact that the study used adults, and both groups preferred blues, and responses to the color ''pink'' were never even tested, the popular press represented the research as an indication of an innate preference by girls for pink. The misreading has been often repeated in market research, reinforcing American culture's association of pink with girls on the basis of imagined innate characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Paoletti, 97-8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Toys ===
Toys aimed at girls often display pink prominently on packaging and the toy themselves. This is a relatively recent trend, with toys from the 1920s to the 1960s not being gendered by color (though they were gendered by a focus on domesticity and nurturing). The current color-based gendering of toys can be traced back to the deregulation of children's television programs. This allowed toy companies to produce shows that were designed specifically to sell their products, and gender was an important differentiator of these shows and the toys they were advertising.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/12/toys-are-more-divided-by-gender-now-than-they-were-50-years-ago/383556/|title=Toys Are More Divided by Gender Now Than They Were 50 Years Ago|last=Sweet|first=Elizabeth|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Elizabeth Sweet argues that toy companies began emphasizing their use of color-coded marketing and segregation of toys in the 1980s: &lt;blockquote&gt;I think it happened really gradually, it wasnt until the late 2000s, the 2010s, that people really started to notice. Now its undeniable.&lt;/blockquote&gt;She said that it encourages a culture where gender stereotypes define a way of life for children. Gender categorization of toys by color was not driven by market trends,&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; but instead by decisions made by leaders of toy companies. Gendering by color allowed companies to better define target markets and gender stereotypes attracted young children who were forming their sense of self identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/12/22/why-should-toys-come-in-pink-and-blue/how-did-toys-get-stereotyped-by-sex|title=How Did Toys Get Stereotyped by Sex?|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/23/opinion/sunday/gender-based-toy-marketing-returns.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Gender-Based Toy Marketing Returns|last=Sweet|first=Elizabeth|date=2012-12-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stores utilize gender-based compartmentalization as a means to help customers find what theyre looking for, but campaigner and parent Jess Day of the nonprofit ''[[Let Toys Be Toys]]'' stated, its driven by a massive assumption about what a child might want, as opposed to experimentation and urging children to play with whatever appeals to them. Additionally, studies have clearly shown the negative aspects of gender-stereotyping. One study documents that more than 100 toys, all heavily gender-coded toys, were less likely to promote cognitive development than gender-neutral toys.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In a way, children may be influenced to shun particular career choices or merely interests that dont align with their own, based on the gendering of the toys they play with. This is considered to be a primary danger of exposing children to prejudices at such a young age, according to experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.in/aradhana-pandey/pink-and-blue-the-myth-be_b_9191840.html|title=Pink And Blue: The Colours Of Gender Stereotyping|date=2016-02-12|work=HuffPost India|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 1957 catalog, [[Lionel Trains]] offered for sale a pink model [[freight train]] for girls. The [[steam locomotive]] and [[coal car]] were pink and the freight cars of the freight train were various [[Pastel (color)|pastel colors]]. The [[caboose]] was [[baby blue]]. It was a marketing failure because any girl who might want a [[model train]] would want a realistically colored train, while boys in the 1950s did not want to be seen playing with a pink train. However, today it is a valuable collector's item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lionel-train-set.com/|title=Lionel's 1957 pink train for girls:|date=|publisher=Lionel-train-set.com|accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[The Lego Group]] launched [[Lego Friends]],  a line of products aimed specifically at the girls' toy market.

=== Academic dress ===
* In the French [[academic dress]] system, the five traditional fields of study (Arts, Science, Medicine, Law and Divinity) are each symbolized by a distinctive color, which appears in the [[academic dress]] of the people who graduated in this field. Redcurrant, an extremely red shade of pink, is the distinctive color for Medicine (and other health-related fields) [[:fr:Groseille (couleur)]].

=== Heraldry ===
The word pink is not used for any tincture (color) in heraldry, but there are two fairly uncommon tinctures which are both close to pink:
* The heraldic color of [[rose (heraldic tincture)|rose]] is a modern innovation, mostly used in Canadian heraldry, depicting a reddish pink color like the shade usually called [[rose (color)|rose]].
* In French heraldry, the color [[carnation (heraldry)|carnation]] is sometimes used, corresponding to the skin color of a light skinned Caucasian human. This can also be seen as a pink shade but is usually depicted slightly more brownish beige than the rose tincture.

=== Calendars ===
* In [[Thailand]], pink is associated with Tuesday on the [[Thai solar calendar]]. Anyone may wear pink on Tuesdays, and anyone born on a Tuesday may adopt pink as their color.

=== The press ===
Pink is used for the newsprint paper of several important newspapers devoted to business and sports, and the color is also connected with the press aimed at the gay community.

Since 1893 the London ''[[Financial Times]]'' newspaper has used a distinctive [[salmon pink]] color for its newsprint, originally because pink dyed paper was less expensive than bleached white paper.&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Stephen Fidler of the Wall Street Journal, formerly a correspondent for the Financial Times.&lt;/ref&gt; Today the color is used to distinguish the newspaper from competitors on a press kiosk or news stand. In some countries, the ''salmon press'' identifies economic newspapers or economics sections in "white" newspapers. Some sports newspapers, such as ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' in Italy, also use pink paper to stand out from other newspapers. It awards a pink jersey to the winner of Italy's most important bicycle race, the [[Giro d'Italia]]. (See [[#Sports]]).

=== Law ===
* In England and Wales, a [[Brief (law)|brief]] delivered to a [[barrister]] by a [[solicitor]] is usually tied with pink ribbon. Pink was traditionally the color associated with the defense, while white ribbons may have been used for the [[prosecution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-evidence-the-barristers-desk-1175803.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Aoife | last=O'Riordain | title=The evidence: The barrister's desk | date=1998-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used for the Third Sunday of [[Advent]] and the Fourth Sunday of [[Lent]] (see [[Laetare Sunday]]) to mark the halfway point in these seasons of penance. For this reason, one of the candles in an [[Advent wreath]] may be pink, rather than purple.
