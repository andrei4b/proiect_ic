'''Britney Jean Spears''' (born December 2, 1981) is an American singer, dancer, and actress. Born in [[McComb, Mississippi]], and raised in [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], she performed acting roles in stage productions and television shows as a child, before signing with [[Jive Records]] in 1997. Spears's first two studio albums, ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'' (1999) and ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' (2000), were global successes and made her the best-selling teenage artist of all time. Referred to as the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princess of Pop]]", Spears was credited with influencing the revival of [[teen pop]], during the late 1990s and the early 2000s.

Spears adopted more mature and provocative themes for her next two studio albums, ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' (2001) and ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003). She also ventured into acting with her starring role in the 2002 film ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]''. However, her much-publicized personal issues sent her career into hiatus. Despite being released while her personal struggles were ongoing, ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'' (2007), is often critically referred to as her best work. Her unusual behavior and hospitalizations placed her under a still ongoing [[conservatorship]].

Spears returned to the top of record charts with her sixth and seventh albums, ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' (2008) and ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2011). In 2012, ''[[Forbes]]'' reported that Spears was the highest paid female musician of the year, with earnings of $58 million, having last topped the list in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/britney-spears-highest-paid-woman-music-2012-full-list-935061 |title=Britney Spears Is The Highest-Paid Woman In Music For 2012; Full List |work=International Business Times |accessdate=January 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the promotion of her eighth and ninth studio albums, ''[[Britney Jean]]'' (2013) and ''[[Glory (Britney Spears album)|Glory]]'' (2016), Spears embarked on the four-year [[concert residency]], [[Britney: Piece of Me]], at [[Planet Hollywood Resort &amp; Casino]] in Las Vegas.

Five of Spears' singles have reached number one in the United States: "[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]", "[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]", "[[3 (Britney Spears song)|3]]", "[[Hold It Against Me]]" and "[[S&amp;M (song)|S&amp;M]]". Other singles, "[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]" and "[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]", topped the Australian and Canadian charts. Spears has earned [[List of awards and nominations received by Britney Spears|numerous awards]] and accolades, including a [[Grammy Award]], six [[MTV Video Music Awards]], including the [[Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award|Video Vanguard Award]], seven [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], including the Millennium Award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7350405/britney-spears-billboard-millenium-award-honoree|title=Britney Spears to Perform Hits Medley at Billboard Music Awards|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. ''Billboard'' ranked her as the eighth biggest artist of the 2000s decade.&lt;ref name="bbad" /&gt; One of the world's [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]], Spears has sold over 100 million records worldwide.&lt;ref name="records" /&gt; In the United States, Spears remains the fourth best-selling female album artist of the [[Nielsen SoundScan]] era,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6509510/ask-billboard-britney-spearss-career-sales?mobile_redirection=false|title=Ask Billboard: Britney Spears's Career Sales|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the best-selling female albums artist of the 2000s.&lt;ref name="21sells" /&gt; In 2004, she launched a [[List of celebrity-branded perfumes|perfume brand]] with [[Elizabeth Arden, Inc.]], from which sales exceeded US$1.5 billion as of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Britney Spears X Factor Deal: By The Numbers |publisher=[[MTV]] |date=October 5, 2012 |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1684879/britney-spears-x-factor-deal-judge/ |accessdate=2014-06-26 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QdHx2SmV?url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1684879/britney-spears-x-factor-deal-judge/ |archivedate=2014-06-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==
=== 19811997: Early life and career beginnings ===
Spears was born in [[McComb, Mississippi]], the second child of [[Lynne Spears|Lynne Irene Bridges]] and James Parnell Spears. Her maternal grandmother, Lillian Portell, was [[England|English]] (born in [[London]]), and one of Spears's maternal great-great-grandfathers was [[Malta|Maltese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Spears |first=Lynne |date=September 16, 2008 |chapter=Chapter 2: Kentwood  From Malta to Louisiana |title=Through the Storm: A Real Story of Fame and Family in a Tabloid World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eOiunEB5ccMC&amp;pg=PA4 |edition=1st |location=Nashville, Tennessee |publisher=[[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson, Inc.]] |page=4 |isbn=978-1-4185-6735-4 |accessdate=February 19, 2014 |quote=But on my mama's side, the family tree is a little more colorful and glamorous.

At age three, she started attending dance lessons in her hometown of [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], and was selected to perform as a solo artist at the annual recital. Spears made her local stage debut at age five, singing "[[What Child Is This?]]" at her [[kindergarten]] graduation. During her childhood, she also attended gymnastics and voice lessons, and won many state-level competitions and children's talent shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rs1&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cover Story: Britney Spears: Britney Spears : Rolling Stone|date=April 15, 1999|work=Rolling Stone|last=Daly|first=Steven|issn=0035-791X|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=foxnews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195283,00.html|title=Britney Spears' Biography |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=July 31, 2008|accessdate=June 6, 2010|last=Reporter|first=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said about her ambition as a child, "I was in my own world, [...] I found out what I'm supposed to do at an early age".&lt;ref name=rs1 /&gt;

At age eight, Spears and her mother Lynne traveled to [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to audition for the 1990s revival of ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''. Casting director Matt Casella rejected her as too young, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's singing and suggested enrolling her at the [[Professional Performing Arts School]]; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York. Spears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical ''[[Ruthless!]]''. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show ''[[Star Search]]'' and was cast in a number of commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laufenberg|2005|p=616}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1992, she was cast in ''The Mickey Mouse Club'' alongside [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Ryan Gosling]], and [[Keri Russell]]. After the show was canceled in 1996, she returned to Mississippi and enrolled at McComb's [[Parklane Academy]]. Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to "the opening scene in ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' with all the [[cliques]]. [...] I was so bored. I was the point guard on the basketball team. I had my boyfriend, and I went to homecoming and Christmas formal. But I wanted more."&lt;ref name="rs1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rs2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cover Story: The Girl Can't Help It|date=May 25, 2000|work=Rolling Stone|last=Mundy|first=Chris|issn=0035-791X|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager [[Lou Pearlman]] to join the female pop group [[Innosense]]. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer [[Larry Rudolph]] for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a [[Whitney Houston]] karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided he wanted to pitch her to record labels, therefore she needed a professional demo. He sent Spears an unused song of [[Toni Braxton]]; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a [[Audio engineer|sound engineer]]. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, arguing that audiences wanted pop bands such as the [[Backstreet Boys]] and the [[Spice Girls]], and "there wasn't going to be another [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], another [[Debbie Gibson]], or another [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]]."&lt;ref name="hughes145" /&gt;

Two weeks later, executives from [[Jive Records]] returned calls to Rudolph.&lt;ref name="hughes145" /&gt; Senior vice president of [[Artists and repertoire|A&amp;R]] Jeff Fenster stated about Spears's audition that "it's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal...For any artist, the motivationthe 'eye of the tiger'is extremely important. And Britney had that."&lt;ref name="rs1" /&gt; Spears then sang Houston's "[[I Have Nothing]]" (1992) for the executives, and was subsequently signed to the label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Taylor, Chuck | url = https://books.google.com/?id=JQoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | journal=Billboard | title = Air Waves: Jive's Britney Spears Sets Top 40 Abuzz With Rhythm-Leaning 'Baby One More Time' | volume = 110 | issue = 43 | date = October 24, 1998 | accessdate = March 11, 2011 | issn = 0006-2510 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from "lower and less poppy" delivery to "distinctively, unmistakably Britney."&lt;ref name="Hughes 2005 147"&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; After hearing the recorded material, president [[Clive Calder]] ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned "[[Sheryl Crow]] music, but younger; more adult contemporary" but felt secure with her label's appointment of producers, since "It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to itit's more me." She flew to [[Cheiron Studios]] in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers [[Max Martin]], [[Denniz Pop]] and [[Rami Yacoub]], among others.&lt;ref name="rs1" /&gt;

=== 19982000: ''...Baby One More Time'' and ''Oops!... I Did It Again'' ===
After Spears returned to the United States, she embarked on a shopping mall promotional tour to promote her upcoming debut album. Her show was a four-song set and she was accompanied by two back up dancers. Her first concert tour followed, as an opening act for [[NSYNC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blandford|2002|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her debut studio album, ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'', was released on January 12, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/britney-spears-teen-queen-rolling-stones-1999-cover-story-20110329|title=Britney Spears, Teen Queen: Rolling Stone's 1999 Cover Story|work=Rolling Stone|year=2011|accessdate=January 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It debuted at number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was certified two-times [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] after a month. Worldwide, the album topped the charts in fifteen countries and sold over 10 million copies in a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blandford|2002|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the biggest selling album ever by a teenage artist.&lt;ref name=foxnews /&gt;

The [[...Baby One More Time (song)|title track]] was released as the [[lead single]] from the album. Originally, Jive Records wanted its music video to be animated; however, Spears rejected it, and suggested the final idea of a Catholic schoolgirl.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2005 147" /&gt; The single sold 500,000 copies on its first day, and peaked at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], topping the chart for two consecutive weeks.

It became a top-ten hit worldwide and further propelled the success of the ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'' album. The album has sold 25 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time.

The April 1999 cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' featured Spears lying on her bed, wearing a bra, shorts and an open top. The [[American Family Association]] (AFA) referred to the shoot as "a disturbing mix of childhood innocence and adult sexuality" and called to "God-loving Americans to boycott stores selling Britney's albums." Spears responded to the outcry commenting, "What's the big deal? I have strong morals. [...] I'd do it again. I thought the pictures were fine. And I was tired of being compared to Debbie Gibson and all of this [[bubblegum pop]] all the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blandford|2002|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before, Spears had announced publicly she would remain a [[virgin]] until marriage.&lt;ref name=foxnews /&gt; On June 28, 1999, Spears began her first headlining [[...Baby One More Time Tour]] in North America, which was positively received by critics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/S/Spears_Britney/1999/07/10/749831.html|title=Spears takes aim at fame|date=July 10, 1999|accessdate=January 1, 2010|last=Stevenson|first=Jane|work=[[Jam!]]|publisher=[[Quebecor Inc.]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131013010943/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/S/Spears_Britney/1999/07/10/749831.html|archivedate=October 13, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but generated some controversy due to her racy outfits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blandford|2002|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extension of the tour, titled Crazy 2k, followed in March 2000.

=== Influences ===
Spears has cited her major influences in her career as being [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Janet Jackson]], and [[Whitney Houston]], her "three favorite artists" as a child whom she would "sing along to [...] day and night in [her] living room"; Houston's "[[I Have Nothing]]" was the song she auditioned to that landed her record deal with Jive Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Horvitz, Louis J.

According to Spears: "I know when I was younger, I looked up to people... like, you know, Janet Jackson and Madonna. And they were major inspirations for me. But I also had my own identity and I knew who I was."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Masley|first=Ed|title=The State of Britneydom: Teen-pop Queen declares 'I'm on the verge of being a woman'|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|page=W.22|date=November 2, 2001|issn=1068-624X|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2002 book ''Madonnastyle'' by Carol Clerk, she is quoted saying: "I have been a huge fan of Madonna since I was a little girl.

After meeting Spears face to face, Janet Jackson stated: "she said to me, 'I'm such a big fan; I really admire you.' That's so flattering. Everyone gets inspiration from some place.

In 2011, Adam Markovitz of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' commented on Spears's voice and music: "We don't ask a whole lot from Britney Spears as an entertainer...we'll still send her straight up the charts simply because she's Britney. She's an American institution, as deeply sacred and messed up as pro wrestling or the filibuster. Musically, though, Spears will always have to measure up to her own gold standards of pop euphony: the operatic slither of 2004's 'Toxic' and the candied funk of 2000's 'Oops!...I Did It Again.' Spears is no technical singer, that's for sure.

Spears has been cited as a musical inspiration by contemporary artists. [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]'s character in 2010 drama film ''[[Country Strong]]'' was inspired by the singer's treatment by the media. According to film director Shana Fest, "that's where this movie came from. I mean, I was seeing what was happening in the media to Britney Spears.
