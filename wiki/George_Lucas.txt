'''George Walton Lucas Jr.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Dana|title=George Lucas|publisher=[[Twenty-First Century Books]]|date=2000|page=12|isbn=0822549751}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born May 14, 1944) is an American [[filmmaker]] and [[entrepreneur]]. Lucas is best known as the creator of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' franchises, as well as the founder of [[Lucasfilm]] and [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]]. He was the chairman and [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]] of [[Lucasfilm]], before selling it to [[The Walt Disney Company]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.broadwayworld.com/article/Breaking-News-Disney-Acquires-Lucasfilm-for-405-Billion-STAR-WARS-Episode-7-in-2015-20121030|title=Disney Acquires Lucasfilm for $4.05 Billion - STAR WARS: Episode 7 in 2015!|work=broadwayworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon graduating from the [[University of Southern California]] in 1967, Lucas co-founded [[American Zoetrope]] with fellow filmmaker [[Francis Ford Coppola]]. Lucas wrote and directed ''[[THX 1138]]'' (1971), based on his earlier student short ''[[Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB]]'', which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973), inspired by his teen years in early 1960s [[Modesto, California]], and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful, and received five [[Academy Award]] nominations including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].

Lucas' next film, an [[Epic film|epic]] [[space opera]] titled ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), went through a troubled production process; however, it was a surprise hit, becoming the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film at the time]], as well as a winner of six Academy Awards and a [[Cultural impact of Star Wars|cultural phenomenon]]. Following the first ''Star Wars'' film, Lucas produced and co-wrote the following installments in the trilogy, ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980) and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983). Along with [[Steven Spielberg]], Lucas co-created and helped collaborate with the stories for the ''Indiana Jones'' films ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom|Temple of Doom]]'' (1984), and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade|The Last Crusade]]'' (1989). Lucas also produced and wrote a variety of films through Lucasfilm in the 1980s and 1990s.

In 1997, Lucas re-released the [[Star Wars#Original trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]] as part of a [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases#1997 Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition|Special Edition]], where he made several [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases|alterations]] to the films; home media releases with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He also returned to directing with the [[Star Wars|''Star Wars'' prequel trilogy]], consisting of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I  The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'' (1999), ''[[Star Wars: Episode II  Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002), and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III  Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005). He later collaborated on the story for the ''Indiana Jones'' sequel ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull|Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008), and served as executive producer for the war film ''[[Red Tails]]'' (2012).

Lucas is one of the American film industry's most financially successful filmmakers and has been personally nominated for four [[Academy Awards]]. Some of his movies are among the 100 highest-grossing movies at the North American [[box office]], adjusted for ticket-price inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm|title=Domestic Grosses Adjusted for Ticket Price Inflation|publisher=BoxOfficeMojo.com|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas is considered a significant figure in the [[New Hollywood]] era.

==Early life==
Lucas was born and raised in [[Modesto, California]], the son of Dorothy Ellinore Lucas (ne Bomberger) and George Walton Lucas Sr., who owned a stationery store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/89/George-Lucas.html|title=George Lucas Biography (1944-)|publisher=FilmReference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.americanancestors.org/third-set-of-ten-hollywood/ |title=No. 83 Royal Descents, Notable Kin, and Printed Sources: A Third Set of Ten Hollywood Figures (or Groups Thereof), with a Coda on Two Directors| publisher= [[New England Historic Genealogical Society]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141018155421/http://www.americanancestors.org/third-set-of-ten-hollywood/| first=Gary Boyd |last=Roberts| date= April 18, 2008 | archivedate= October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is of German, [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-German, English, Scottish, and distant Dutch and French descent. Growing up, Lucas had a passion for cars and motor racing, which later inspired his films ''[[1:42.08]]'' and ''[[American Graffiti]]''. Long before Lucas became obsessed with filmmaking, he yearned to be a race-car driver, and he spent most of his high school years racing on the underground circuit at fairgrounds and hanging out at garages.  On June 12, 1962, at age eighteen, while driving his souped-up [[Autobianchi Bianchina]], another driver broadsided him, flipping over his car, nearly killing him, causing him to lose interest in racing as a career.&lt;ref name=pollockskywalking&gt;Pollock, Dale, ''Skywalking: The Life and Films of George Lucas'',  Harmony Books, New York, 1983, {{ISBN|0-517-54677-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oprah.com/own-oprahs-next-chapter/Filmmaker-George-Lucas-Near-Death-Experience-Video "Filmmaker George Lucas' Near-Death Experience"], ''oprah.com'', January 22, 2012. Retrieved October 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Modesto Junior College]], where he studied [[anthropology]], sociology, and literature, amongst other subjects.&lt;ref name=pollockskywalking /&gt; He also began shooting with an 8&amp;nbsp;mm camera, including filming car races.&lt;ref name=pollockskywalking /&gt;

At this time, Lucas and his friend John Plummer became interested in [[Canyon Cinema]]: screenings of [[Underground film|underground]], [[avant-garde]] 16&amp;nbsp;mm filmmakers like [[Jordan Belson]], [[Stan Brakhage]], and [[Bruce Conner]].&lt;ref name=WiredMay2005&gt;{{cite news| first=Steve|last= Silberman| url = https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.05/lucas.html |title=Life After Darth| work=''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date= May 2005|accessdate= October 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas and Plummer also saw classic European films of the time, including [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]'', [[Franois Truffaut]]'s ''[[Jules and Jim|Jules et Jim]]'', and [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[8]]''.&lt;ref name=WiredMay2005 /&gt; "That's when George really started exploring," Plummer said.&lt;ref name=WiredMay2005 /&gt; Through his interest in [[autocross]] racing, Lucas met renowned [[cinematographer]] [[Haskell Wexler]], another race enthusiast.&lt;ref name=pollockskywalking /&gt;&lt;ref name=WiredMay2005 /&gt; Wexler, later to work with Lucas on several occasions, was impressed by Lucas' talent.&lt;ref name=pollockskywalking /&gt; "George had a very good eye, and he thought visually," he recalled.&lt;ref name=WiredMay2005 /&gt;

Lucas then transferred to the [[University of Southern California]] (USC) [[USC School of Cinematic Arts|School of Cinematic Arts]]. USC was one of the earliest universities to have a school devoted to [[motion picture film]]. During the years at USC, Lucas shared a dorm room with [[Randal Kleiser]]. Along with classmates such as [[Walter Murch]], [[Hal Barwood]], and [[John Milius]], they became a clique of film students known as [[The Dirty Dozen (filmmaking)|The Dirty Dozen]]. He also became good friends with fellow acclaimed student filmmaker and future ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' collaborator, [[Steven Spielberg]]. Lucas was deeply influenced by the Filmic Expression course taught at the school by filmmaker [[Lester Novros]] which concentrated on the non-narrative elements of Film Form like color, light, movement, space, and time. Another inspiration was the Serbian montagist (and dean of the USC Film Department) [[Slavko Vorkapi]], a film theoretician who made stunning [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] sequences for Hollywood studio features at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], [[RKO Pictures|RKO]], and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]. Vorkapich taught the autonomous nature of the cinematic art form, emphasizing the unique dynamic quality of movement and kinetic energy inherent in motion pictures.

==Film career==

===196569: Early career===
Lucas saw many inspiring films in class, particularly the visual films coming out of the [[National Film Board of Canada]] like [[Arthur Lipsett]]'s ''[[21-87]]'', the French-Canadian [[cameraman]] [[Jean-Claude Labrecque]]'s [[cinma vrit]] ''[[60 Cycles]]'', the work of [[Norman McLaren]], and the documentaries of [[Claude Jutra]]. Lucas fell madly in love with [[pure cinema]] and quickly became prolific at making 16&amp;nbsp;mm nonstory noncharacter visual tone poems and cinma vrit with such titles as ''[[Look at Life (film)|Look at Life]]'', ''[[Herbie (film)|Herbie]]'', ''[[1:42.08]]'', ''[[The Emperor (film)|The Emperor]]'', ''[[Anyone Lived in a Pretty How Town (film)|Anyone Lived in a Pretty (how) Town]]'', ''[[Filmmaker (film)|Filmmaker]]'', and ''[[6-18-67]]''. He was passionate and interested in camerawork and editing, defining himself as a filmmaker as opposed to being a director, and he loved making abstract visual films that created emotions purely through cinema.&lt;ref name=WiredMay2005 /&gt;

After graduating with a bachelor of [[fine arts]] in film in 1967, he tried joining the [[United States Air Force]] as an officer, but he was immediately turned down because of his numerous speeding tickets. He was later [[Conscription|drafted]] by the Army for military service in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], but he was exempted from service after medical tests showed he had [[diabetes]], the disease that killed his paternal grandfather.

In 1967, Lucas re-enrolled as a USC graduate student in film production.&lt;ref name=FGL&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/george-lucas |title=George Lucas |date=September 2012 |work=Forbes |accessdate=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working as a teaching instructor for a class of [[U.S. Navy]] students who were being taught documentary cinematography, Lucas directed the short film ''[[Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB]]'', which won first prize at the 196768 National Student [[film festival]], and was later adapted into his first full-length feature film, ''[[THX 1138]]''. Lucas was awarded a student scholarship by [[Warner Bros.]] to observe and work on the making of a film of his choosing. The film he chose was ''[[Finian's Rainbow (film)|Finian's Rainbow]]'' (1968) which was being directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]], who was revered among film school students of the time as a cinema graduate who had "made it" in Hollywood. In 1969, Lucas was one of the camera operators on the classic [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] concert film ''[[Gimme Shelter (1970 film)|Gimme Shelter]]''.

===196977: ''THX 1138'', ''American Graffiti'', and ''Star Wars''===
In 1969, Lucas co-founded the studio [[American Zoetrope]] with Coppolawhom he met during his internship at Warner Bros.hoping to create a liberating environment for filmmakers to direct outside the perceived oppressive control of the Hollywood [[studio system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=American Zoetrope: In a galaxy not from Hollywood ...|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/17/zoetrope-coppola-lucas-star-wars|accessdate=September 25, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first full-length feature film produced by the studio, ''[[THX 1138]]'', was not a success. Lucas then created his own company, [[Lucasfilm, Ltd.]], and directed the successful ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973).

Lucas then set his sights on adapting [[Flash Gordon]], an adventure serial from his childhood that he fondly remembered. When he was unable to obtain the rights, he set out to write an original space adventure that would eventually become ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''. Despite his success with his previous film, all but one studio turned ''Star Wars'' down. It was only because [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]], at [[20th Century Fox]] liked ''American Graffiti'' that he forced through a production and distribution deal for the film, which ended up restoring Fox to financial stability after a number of flops.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Shone]]: ''[[Blockbuster (2004 book)|Blockbuster]]: How Hollywood Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Summer'' (2004). London, Simon &amp; Schuster UK. {{ISBN|0-7432-6838-5}}. Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Star Wars'' was significantly influenced by samurai films of [[Akira Kurosawa]], spaghetti westerns, as well as classic swords &amp; sorcery fantasy stories.

''Star Wars'' quickly became the [[list of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of all-time]], displaced five years later by Spielberg's ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''. After the success of ''American Graffiti'' and prior to the beginning of filming on ''Star Wars'', Lucas was encouraged to renegotiate for a higher fee for writing and directing ''Star Wars'' than the $150,000 agreed.&lt;ref name=pollockskywalking /&gt; He declined to do so, instead negotiating for advantage in some of the as-yet-unspecified parts of his contract with Fox, in particular ownership of licensing and merchandising rights (for [[novelization]]s, T-shirts, toys, etc.) and contractual arrangements for sequels.&lt;ref name=pollockskywalking /&gt; The studio was unconcerned to relinquish these rights, as its last major attempt in the field, with the film ''[[Doctor Dolittle (film)|Doctor Dolittle]]'' (1967), had proved a discouraging failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Mark|title=Pictures at a Revolution: Five Films and the Birth of the New Hollywood|year=2008|publisher=Penguin Press|pages=3789}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas exploited merchandising rights wisely, and Lucasfilm has earned hundreds of millions of dollars from licensed games, toys, and collectibles created for the franchise.&lt;ref name=pollockskywalking /&gt;

===197793: Hiatus from directing, ''Indiana Jones''===
[[File:Lucas - Henson - 1986.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Director [[Jim Henson]] (left) and Lucas working on ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]'' in 1986.]]
Following the release of the first ''Star Wars'' film, Lucas worked extensively as a writer and producer, including on the many ''Star Wars'' spinoffs made for film, television, and other media. Lucas acted as executive producer for the next two ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, commissioning [[Irvin Kershner]] to direct ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', and [[Richard Marquand]] to direct ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', while receiving a story credit on the former and sharing a screenwriting credit with [[Lawrence Kasdan]] on the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.empireonline.com/features/star-wars-making-of-empire-strikes-back|title= The Making of Empire Strikes Back|date=June 2002|work=Empire Magazine|accessdate=May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also acted as executive producer and story writer on all four of the ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' films, which his colleague and good friend [[Steven Spielberg]] directed.

Other successful projects where Lucas acted as a producer or writer in this period include [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Kagemusha]]'' (1980), Lawrence Kasdan's ''[[Body Heat]]'' (1981), ''[[Ewoks: Caravan of Courage]]'' (1984), ''[[Ewoks: Battle for Endor]]'' (1985), [[Jim Henson]]'s ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]'' (1986), [[Godfrey Reggio]]'s ''[[Powaqqatsi]]'' (1986), [[Don Bluth]]'s ''[[The Land Before Time]]'' (1988), and the ''Indiana Jones'' television spinoff ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' (199296). There were unsuccessful projects, however, including ''[[More American Graffiti]]'' (1979), [[Willard Huyck]]'s ''[[Howard the Duck (film)|Howard the Duck]]'' (1986), which was the biggest flop of Lucas's career, [[Ron Howard]]'s ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]'' (1988), Coppola's ''[[Tucker: The Man and His Dream]]'' (1988), and [[Mel Smith]]'s ''[[Radioland Murders]]'' (1994).

The animation studio [[Pixar]] was founded in 1979 as the Graphics Group, one third of the Computer Division of [[Lucasfilm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pixar Story|url=http://rfostermsm.edublogs.org/2011/04/20/pixar-story/|date=April 20, 2011|accessdate=September 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pixar's early computer graphics research resulted in groundbreaking effects in films such as ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]''&lt;ref name="PixarStory"&gt;{{Cite journal| last =Hormby | first =Thomas | author-link = | last2 = | publisher =Low End Mac| first2 = | author2-link = | title =The Pixar Story: Dick Shoup, Alex Schure, George Lucas, Steve Jobs, and Disney | date =January 22, 2007 | url =http://lowendmac.com/2013/pixar-story-steve-jobs-disney-toy-story/ | accessdate =March 1, 2007 | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Young Sherlock Holmes]]'',&lt;ref name="PixarStory"/&gt; and the group was purchased in 1986 by [[Steve Jobs]] shortly after he left [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]. Jobs paid Lucas US$5 million and put US$5 million as capital into the company. The sale reflected Lucas' desire to stop the cash flow losses from his 7-year research projects associated with new entertainment technology tools, as well as his company's new focus on creating entertainment products rather than tools. A contributing factor was cash-flow difficulties following Lucas' 1983 divorce concurrent with the sudden dropoff in revenues from ''[[Star Wars]]'' licenses following the release of ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.

The sound-equipped system [[THX]] Ltd. was founded by Lucas and [[Tomlinson Holman]].&lt;ref name=Softpedia&gt;Truta, Filip Truta (May 5, 2011). [http://news.softpedia.com/news/Apple-Hires-Sound-Systems-Inventor-Tomlinson-Holman-198553.shtml "Apple Hires Sound Systems Inventor Tomlinson Holman"]. [[Softpedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; The company was formerly owned by Lucasfilm, and contains equipment for stereo, digital, and theatrical sound for films, and music. [[Skywalker Sound]] and [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]], are the sound and visual effects subdivisions of Lucasfilm, while Lucasfilm Games, later renamed [[LucasArts]], produces products for the gaming industry.

===19932012: Return to directing, return to ''Star Wars'' and ''Indiana Jones''===
[[File:George Lucas Medal of Technology.jpg|thumb|left|Lucas receiving the [[National Medal of Technology and Innovation]] from President [[George W. Bush]], 2006]]

After losing much of his fortune in a divorce settlement in 1987, Lucas had no desire to return to ''Star Wars'', and had unofficially canceled his [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel trilogy]] by the time of ''Return of the Jedi''.{{Sfn |Kaminski|2007|p=227|ref=kaminski}} Nevertheless, the prequels, which were still only a series of basic ideas partially pulled from his original drafts of "The Star Wars", continued to tantalize him with technical possibilities that would make it worthwhile to revisit his older material. When ''Star Wars'' became popular once again, in the wake of [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]]'s comic book line and [[Timothy Zahn]]'s [[Thrawn trilogy|trilogy of novels]], Lucas realized that there was still a large audience. His children were older, and with the explosion of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] technology he was now considering returning to directing.{{Sfn |Kaminski|2007|pp=29495|ref=kaminski}}

By 1993, it was announced, in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' among other sources, that Lucas would be making the prequels. He began penning more to the story, indicating that the series would be a tragic one, examining Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side. Lucas also began to change the prequels status relative to the originals; at first they were supposed to be a "filling-in" of history tangential to the originals, but now he saw that they could form the beginning of one long story that started with Anakin's childhood and ended with his death. This was the final step towards turning the film series into a "Saga".{{Sfn |Kaminski|2007|pp= 299300|ref=kaminski}} In 1994, Lucas began work on the screenplay of the first prequel, tentatively titled ''Episode I: The Beginning''.

In 1997, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of ''Star Wars,'' Lucas returned to the original trilogy and made numerous modifications using newly available digital technology, releasing them in theaters as the ''Star Wars Special Edition''. For DVD releases in 2004 and Blu-ray releases in 2011, the trilogy received further revisions to make them congruent with the prequel trilogy. Besides the additions to the ''Star Wars'' franchise, Lucas released a ''Director's Cut'' of ''THX 1138'' in 2004, with the film re-cut and containing a number of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] revisions.

The first ''Star Wars'' prequel was finished and released in 1999 as ''[[Star Wars: Episode I  The Phantom Menace|Episode I  The Phantom Menace]]'', which would be the first film Lucas had directed in over two decades.

Lucas collaborated with [[Jeff Nathanson]] as a writer of the 2008 film ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', directed by Steven Spielberg. Like the ''Star Wars'' prequels, reception was mixed, with numerous fans and critics once again considering it inferior to its predecessors.

Lucas was born and raised in a [[Methodism|Methodist]] family.&lt;ref name=pollockskywalking /&gt; The religious and mythical themes in ''[[Star Wars]]'' were inspired by Lucas's interest in the writings of mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/george-lucas/about-george-lucas/649/|title=George Lucas - About George Lucas - American Masters - PBS|work=pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he would eventually come to identify strongly with the Eastern religious philosophies he studied and incorporated into his films, which were a major inspiration for "[[Force (Star Wars)|the Force]]". Lucas has come to state that his religion is "[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] Methodist". He resides in [[Marin County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1002327,00.html | work=Time | title=Director: So, What's the Deal with Leia's Hair? | date=April 29, 2002 | accessdate=September 2, 2011 | first=Jess | last=Cagle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pl/George_Lucas.html |title=The Religious Affiliation of Director George Lucas| publisher=Adherents.com| date= n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucas is a major collector of the American illustrator and painter [[Norman Rockwell]].

Lucas has said that he is a fan of [[Seth MacFarlane]]'s hit TV show ''[[Family Guy]]''. MacFarlane has said that Lucasfilm was extremely helpful when the ''Family Guy'' crew wanted to [[Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy|parody their works]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bonnie |last=Burton |title="Family Guy" Creator Reveals Star Wars Cred |url=http://www.starwars.com/community/news/rocks/f20070921/index.html |publisher=Starwars.com |date=September 21, 2007 |accessdate=September 21, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905151825/http://www.starwars.com/community/news/rocks/f20070921/index.html |archivedate=September 5, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucas was nominated for four Academy Awards: [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Directing]] and [[Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay|Writing]] for ''American Graffiti'' and ''Star Wars''.

The [[EMP Museum#Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame|Science Fiction Hall of Fame]] inducted Lucas in 2006, its second "Film, Television, and Media" contributor, after Spielberg.&lt;ref name=sfhof2006/&gt;&lt;ref name="sfhof2006-b"/&gt;{{efn|name=sfhof}} The [[Discovery Channel]] named him one of the 100 "[[The Greatest American|Greatest Americans]]" in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/greatestamerican/top100/top100.html |title=Discovery Channel :: Greatest American: Top 100 |publisher=Dsc.discovery.com |date=September 10, 2008 |accessdate=December 31, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218191443/http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/greatestamerican/top100/top100.html |archivedate=December 18, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas served as [[Grand Marshal]] for the [[Tournament of Roses Parade]] and made the ceremonial coin toss at the [[2007 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl, New Year's Day 2007]].
