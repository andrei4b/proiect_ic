In the end, it came down to a one-on-one with Steve Austin (who had recently joined The Alliance). The Rock seemed to have the upper hand, until Jericho (a member of Team WWF, who was eliminated a few minutes earlier), entered the ring and attacked The Rock. Austin tried to capitalize on this by pinning The Rock, but Kurt Angle, a Team Alliance member, revealed his true allegiance by hitting Austin in the head with a title belt. The Rock then pinned Austin, forcing The Alliance to disband. The Rock's WCW Championship was renamed the unbranded "World Championship" following the Alliance's loss.&lt;ref name="owwpro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="survivorseries01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/2001/mainevent/ |title=The Rock, Chris Jericho, Big Show, Kane &amp; Undertaker def.

After failing to win number one contendership for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]], The Rock turned his attention to Steve Austin who, to The Rock's chagrin, had been chosen as "Superstar of the Decade". This led to a match at [[WrestleMania XIX]], which called back to their previous two WrestleMania encounters, both of which Austin had won. The Rock won after delivering three consecutive ''Rock Bottoms'', ending their long-running feud in what turned out to be Austin's final match.&lt;ref name="owwpro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wm19"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm19/results/ |title=WrestleMania XIX official results |accessdate=March 21, 2008 |publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next night, ''Raw'' was billed as "The Rock Appreciation Night", in honour of his victory over Austin. That night, he was attacked by a debuting [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]].
