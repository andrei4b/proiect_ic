Cruise grew up in near poverty, and had a Catholic upbringing. The family was dominated by his abusive father, whom Cruise has described as "a merchant of chaos."&lt;ref name= parade&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2006/edition_04-09-2006/Tom_Cruise_cover|title=I Can Create Who I Am|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|date=April 9, 2006|accessdate=February 18, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412060632/http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2006/edition_04-09-2006/Tom_Cruise_cover|archivedate=April 12, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruise has said that he was beaten by his father, whom he has called a "bully and coward." He stated, "He was the kind of person where, if something goes wrong, they kick you. It was a great lesson in my lifehow he'd lull you in, make you feel safe and then, bang! For me, it was like, 'There's something wrong with this guy. Don't trust him. Be careful around him.'"&lt;ref name= parade /&gt;

Cruise spent part of his childhood in Canada. His family moved to [[Beacon Hill, Ottawa]], in late 1971 so that Cruise's father could take a position as a defense consultant with the [[Canadian Forces|Canadian Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name= Unauthorized_ex&gt;{{cite book|url=http://i.usatoday.net/life/books/tom_cruise_excerpt.pdf | title= Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography| first= Andrew |last= Morton| series= Ch. 1| publisher= Macmillan| date= January 15, 2008| access-date= October 13, 2016| isbn= 9781429933902}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, Cruise attended the newly opened [[Robert Hopkins Public School]] for much of grade four and grade five.&lt;ref name= Unauthorized_ex /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| website= ocdsb.ca| publisher= Ottawa-Carleton District School Board| url= http://www.ocdsb.ca/sch/20102011%20Elementary%20School%20Profile/RHOP.pdf| title= Robert Hopkins School Profile| accessdate= September 25, 2012| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130117025444/http://www.ocdsb.ca/sch/20102011%20Elementary%20School%20Profile/RHOP.pdf| archivedate= January 17, 2013| df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In grade four, Cruise first became involved in drama, under the tutelage of George Steinburg. Cruise and six other boys put on an improvised play to music called ''IT'' at the Carleton Elementary School drama festival.&lt;ref name= Unauthorized_ex /&gt; Drama organizer Val Wright, who was in the audience that night, reflected, "The movement and improvisation were excellent. It was a classic ensemble piece."&lt;ref name= Unauthorized_ex /&gt; Cruise also enjoyed sports at the school and played [[floor hockey]], though he was known more for his aggression than his talent.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In sixth grade, Cruise went to [[Henry Munro Middle School]] in [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Canada]]. However, in the spring of that year, Cruise's mother left his father, taking Cruise and his sisters back to the United States.&lt;ref name= Unauthorized_ex /&gt; His father died of cancer in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/tom-cruise-katie-holmes-upbringings-torn/story?id=16742057 |title= Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes: Very Different Upbringings| publisher= [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] | first= Luchina| last= Fisher| website= ABCNews.go.com |date= July 10, 2012| access-date= October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruise briefly attended a [[Franciscan]] [[seminary]] in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], on a church scholarship and aspired to become a Catholic priest, before his interest in acting.&lt;ref name= Unauthorized&gt;{{cite book| title= Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography| first= Andrew |last= Morton| publisher= Macmillan| date= January 15, 2008| isbn= 9781429933902}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2426}} In his senior year, he played [[American football|football]] for the varsity team as a [[linebacker]], but he was cut from the squad after getting caught drinking beer before a game.&lt;ref name= Unauthorized/&gt;{{rp|47}}  In total, Cruise attended 15 schools in 14 years, including stints in at least two suburban [[New Jersey]] towns, including [[Glen Ridge, New Jersey|Glen Ridge]].&lt;ref name=FamousNJ&gt;{{cite web|website= FamousNewJerseyans.com| url= http://www.famousnewjerseyans.com/entertainers.htm| title= New Jersey Entertainers| accessdate= October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Acting===
Cruise first appeared in a [[bit part]] in the 1981 film ''[[Endless Love (1981 film)|Endless Love]]'', followed by a major supporting role as a crazed military academy student in ''[[Taps (film)|Taps]]'' later that year. In 1983, Cruise was part of the ensemble cast of ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]''. That same year he appeared in ''[[All the Right Moves (film)|All the Right Moves]]'' and ''[[Risky Business]]'', which has been described as "A [[Generation X]] classic, and a career-maker for Tom Cruise",&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1017641-risky_business/ |title=Risky Business|publisher=Rottentomatoes.com |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which, along with 1986's ''[[Top Gun]]'', cemented his status as a [[superstar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Tony Scott| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19316140|accessdate=October 9, 2015|newspaper=BBC News|date=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruise also played the male lead  in the [[Ridley Scott]] film ''[[Legend (1985 film)|Legend]]'', released in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ridley Scott's beautiful dark twisted fantasy: the making of Legend|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/legend-ridley-scott/tom-cruise-making-of/|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=October 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tom cruise 1989.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cruise at the [[61st Academy Awards]] in 1989]]

Cruise followed up ''Top Gun'' with ''[[The Color of Money]]'', which came out the same year, and which paired him with  [[Paul Newman]]. 1988 saw him star in ''[[Cocktail (1988 film)|Cocktail]]'', which earned him a nomination for the [[Razzie Award for Worst Actor]]. Later that year he starred with [[Dustin Hoffman]] in ''[[Rain Man]]'', which won the [[Academy Award for Best Film]] and Cruise the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor. Cruise portrayed real-life paralyzed [[Vietnam War]] veteran [[Ron Kovic]] in 1989's ''[[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|Born on the Fourth of July]]'', which earned him a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama]], the [[Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor]], the [[People's Choice Award]] for Favorite Motion Picture Actor, a nomination for [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role]], and Cruise's first Best Actor Academy Award nomination.

Cruise's next films were ''[[Days of Thunder]]'' (1990) and ''[[Far and Away]]'' (1992), both of which co-starred then-wife [[Nicole Kidman]] as his love interest. In 1994, Cruise starred along with [[Brad Pitt]], [[Antonio Banderas]] and [[Christian Slater]] in [[Neil Jordan]]'s ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'', a gothic drama/horror film that was based on [[Anne Rice]]'s [[Interview with the Vampire|best-selling novel]]. The film was well received, although Rice was initially quite outspoken in her criticism of Cruise having been cast in the film, as [[Julian Sands]] was her first choice. Upon seeing the film however, she paid $7,740 for a two-page ad in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]'' praising his performance and apologizing for her previous doubts about him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,305073,00.html Go Figure], ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', December 30, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Cruise appeared as superspy [[Ethan Hunt]] in the reboot of ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'', which he produced. It was a box office success, although it received criticism regarding the Jim Phelps character being a villain despite being a protagonist of the original television series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117060/reviews?start=10|title=Mission: Impossible  Reviews &amp; Ratings  IMDb|work=IMDb|accessdate=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, he took on the title role in ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'', for which he earned a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe]] and his second nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Academy Award]]. In 1999, Cruise costarred with Kidman in the erotic [[Stanley Kubrick]] film ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'', and took a rare [[Supporting actor|supporting role]], as a motivational speaker, Frank T.J. Mackey, in ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'', for which he received another [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor  Motion Picture|Golden Globe]] and nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Academy Award]].
[[File:Tom Cruise 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|Cruise in March 2006]]
In 2000, Cruise returned as [[Ethan Hunt]] in the second installment of the ''Mission Impossible'' films, releasing ''[[Mission: Impossible 2]]''. The film was directed by Hong Kong director [[John Woo]] and branded with his [[gun fu]] style, and it continued the series' blockbuster success at the box office, taking in almost $547M in worldwide figures, like its predecessor, being the third highest-grossing film of the year; despite being a success it along with its predecessor received a mixed reception. Cruise received an [[MTV Movie Award]] as Best Male Performance for this film.

His next five films were major critical and commercial successes.&lt;ref name=boxofficemojotomcruise&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?view=Actor&amp;id=tomcruise.htm |title=Tom Cruise |website=Boxofficemojo.com |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/tom_cruise/ |title=Tom Cruise Movies, News, and Pictures on Rotten Tomatoes |website=Rottentomatoes.com |accessdate=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Cruise starred in the romantic thriller ''[[Vanilla Sky]]'' (2001) with [[Cameron Diaz]] and [[Penlope Cruz]]. In 2002, Cruise starred in the [[dystopia]]n science fiction thriller, ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' which was directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] and based on the science fiction short story by [[Philip K. Dick]].

In 2003, he starred in the [[Edward Zwick]]'s historical drama ''[[The Last Samurai]]'', for which he received a Golden Globe nomination as best actor. In 2005, Cruise worked again with Steven Spielberg in ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'', a loose adaptation of the [[H. G. Wells]] [[The War of the Worlds|novel of the same name]], which became the fourth highest-grossing film of the year with US$591.4&amp;nbsp;million worldwide. Also in 2005, he won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Male Movie Star, and the MTV Generation Award. Cruise was nominated for seven [[Saturn Awards]] between 2002 and 2009, winning once. Nine of the ten films he starred in during the decade made over $100&amp;nbsp;million at the box office.&lt;ref name=boxofficemojotomcruise/&gt;
[[File:Tom Cruise avp 2014 4.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cruise in Paris at the French premiere of ''[[Edge of Tomorrow (film)|Edge of Tomorrow]]'', May 2014.]]
In 2006, he returned to his role as Ethan Hunt in the third installment of the ''Mission Impossible'' film series, ''[[Mission: Impossible III]]''. The film was more positively received by critics than the previous films in the series, it grossed nearly $400&amp;nbsp;million at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=mi3.htm |title=Mission: Impossible III (2006) |website=Boxofficemojo.com |accessdate=August 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Cruise took a rare supporting role for the second time in ''[[Lions for Lambs]]'', which was a commercial disappointment. This was followed by an unrecognizable appearance as "Les Grossman" in the 2008 comedy ''[[Tropic Thunder]]'' with [[Ben Stiller]], [[Jack Black]], and [[Robert Downey Jr.]]  This performance earned Cruise a [[Golden Globe]] nomination.

===Producing===
Cruise partnered with his former talent agent [[Paula Wagner]] to form [[Cruise/Wagner Productions]] in 1993,&lt;ref name="MGM"&gt;{{cite news|title=MGM Partners With Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner to Form New United Artists |url=http://sev.prnewswire.com/entertainment/20061102/LATH10602112006-1.html |agency=PR Newswire |publisher=Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios |date=November 2, 2006 |quote= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929115013/http://sev.prnewswire.com/entertainment/20061102/LATH10602112006-1.html |archivedate=September 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the company has since co-produced several of Cruise's films, the first being ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'' in 1996 which was also Cruise's first project as a producer.

Cruise is noted as having negotiated some of the most lucrative film deals in Hollywood, and was described in 2005 by Hollywood economist [[Edward Jay Epstein]] as "one of the most powerful  and richest  forces in Hollywood." Epstein argues that Cruise is one of the few producers (the others being [[George Lucas]], [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]) who are regarded as able to guarantee the success of a billion-dollar film franchise. Epstein also contends that the public obsession with Cruise's tabloid controversies obscures full appreciation of Cruise's exceptional commercial prowess.&lt;ref name="Epstein"&gt;{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Edward Jay|authorlink=Edward Jay Epstein|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2121617/ |title=Tom Cruise Inc. |website=Slate.com|accessdate=October 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cruise/Wagner Productions, Cruise's film production company, is said to be developing a screenplay based on [[Erik Larson (author)|Erik Larson]]'s ''[[New York Times]]'' bestseller, ''[[The Devil in the White City]]'' about a real life serial killer, [[H. H. Holmes]], at Chicago's [[World's Columbian Exposition]]. [[Kathryn Bigelow]] is attached to the project to produce and helm. Meanwhile, [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]'s production company, Appian Way, is also developing a film about Holmes and the [[World's Fair]], in which DiCaprio will star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thezreview.co.uk/comingsoon/d/devilinthewhitecitythe.htm |title=The Devil In The White City movie, trailer, review, pics, pictures, poster, news, DVD|website=Thezreview.co.uk |accessdate=October 31, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080705065258/http://www.thezreview.co.uk/comingsoon/d/devilinthewhitecitythe.htm |archivedate = July 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cruise has produced for multiple films in which he has been. He produced ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'', ''[[Without Limits]]'', ''[[Mission: Impossible 2]]'', ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]]'', ''[[Vanilla Sky]]'' and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000129/|title=Tom Cruise Production Credits|last=|first=|website=IMDb.com|access-date=January 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Breakup with Paramount====
On August 22, 2006, [[Paramount Pictures]] announced it was ending its 14-year relationship with Cruise. In the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', chairman of [[Viacom]] (Paramount's parent company) [[Sumner Redstone]] cited the economic damage to Cruise's value as an actor and producer from his controversial public behavior and views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/08/22/news/newsmakers/cruise_paramount/index.htm?cnn=yes |title=CNN: Paramount Pictures cuts ties with Tom Cruise |publisher=CNN  |date=August 23, 2006 |accessdate=August 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalledger.com/artman/publish/article_27267912.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015319/http://www.nationalledger.com/artman/publish/article_27267912.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |title=Sumner Redstone Rebuke of Tom Cruise: Now What? |publisher=National Ledger |accessdate=August 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruise/Wagner Productions responded that Paramount's announcement was a face-saving move after the production company had successfully sought alternative financing from [[private equity]] firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lieberman |first=David |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2006-08-23-hedge-films-usat_x.htm |title=Cruise seeks financial backing from hedge funds |work=USA Today |date=August 24, 2006 |accessdate=August 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industry analysts such as Edward Jay Epstein commented that the real reason for the split was most likely Paramount's discontent over Cruise/Wagner's exceptionally large share of DVD sales from the ''Mission: Impossible'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/d817b680-33a0-11db-981f-0000779e2340.html|title=Paramount vs Cruise: all down to the killer cut|work=Financial Times|accessdate=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Nicole |last=Sperling |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003052563 |title=Biz eyeing economics of Cruise-Par breakup: DVD slowdown forcing restraint |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |date=August 24, 2006 |accessdate=August 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113093430/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003052563 |archivedate=January 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Management of United Artists====
In November 2006, Cruise and Paula Wagner announced that they had taken over the film studio [[United Artists]].&lt;ref name="MGM"/&gt; Cruise acts as a producer and star in films for United Artists, while Wagner serves as UA's chief executive.

Production began in 2007 of ''[[Valkyrie (film)|Valkyrie]]'', a thriller based on the July 20, 1944 assassination attempt against [[Adolf Hitler]]. The film was acquired in March 2007 by United Artists. On March 21, 2007 Cruise signed on to play [[Claus von Stauffenberg]], the [[protagonist]]. This project marks the second production to be greenlighted since Cruise and Wagner took control of United Artists. The first was its inaugural film, ''[[Lions for Lambs]]'', directed by [[Robert Redford]] and starring Redford, [[Meryl Streep]] and Cruise. ''Lambs'' was released on November 9, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsmax.com/archives/ic/2007/3/21/73153.shtml?s=en |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712180209/http://newsmax.com/archives/ic/2007/3/21/73153.shtml?s=en |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 12, 2012 |title=Tom Cruise Takes on Adolf Hitler |website=Newsmax.com |date=March 21, 2007 |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; opening to unimpressive box office revenue and critical reception.

In August 2008, Wagner stepped down from her position at United Artists; she retains her stake in UA, which combined with Cruise's share amounts to 30 percent of the studio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/14/business/fi-wagner14 Paula Wagner plans to step down at United Artists], an August 2008 article from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tom Cruise and Mimi Rogers.jpg|thumb|Tom Cruise and Mimi Rogers at the 1989 Oscars]]
Cruise is an outspoken advocate for the [[Church of Scientology]] and its associated social programs. He became involved with Scientology in 1990 through his first wife, [[Mimi Rogers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/1791617.stm |title=Cruise lobbies over Scientology|publisher=BBC News |date=January 30, 2002 |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruise struggled with [[dyslexia]] at an early age&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20140587,00.html|title=Tom Cruise: My Struggle to Read|website=People.com|accessdate=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has said that Scientology, specifically the [[L. Ron Hubbard]] [[Study Tech]], helped him overcome dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cruise credits Scientology for his success|work=msnbc.com|date=May 24, 2005|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7968809/|accessdate=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cruise's advocacy of Scientology===
In addition to promoting various programs that introduce people to Scientology, Cruise has campaigned for Scientology to be recognized as a religion in Europe. In 2005, the Paris city council revealed that Cruise had lobbied officials [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] and [[Jean-Claude Gaudin]], described him as a spokesman and militant for Scientology, and barred any further dealings with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.examiner.ie/breaking/story.asp?j=182470131&amp;p=y8z47x994&amp;n=182471074&amp;x= |title=Paris snubs Scientology 'militant' Cruise |work=Irish Examiner|date=July 13, 2005 |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prgparis.org/node/57 "Tom Cruise ne sera pas citoyen d'honneur de Paris"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425091546/http://www.prgparis.org/node/57 |date=April 25, 2012 }} (in French). July 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cruise co-founded and raised donations for [[Downtown Medical]] to offer New York City [[9/11]] rescue workers [[Purification Rundown|detoxification therapy]] based on the works of L. Ron Hubbard. This drew criticism from the medical profession&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, Michelle (October 4, 2003). [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/04/nyregion/04DETO.html?ex=1148011200&amp;en=c46507c25827d1c3&amp;ei=5070 "Scientologist's Treatments Lure Firefighters"].

For such activities, Scientology leader [[David Miscavige]] created the Scientology Freedom Medal of Valor and awarded it to Cruise in late 2004.&lt;ref name="vanity"&gt;{{cite web |title= What Katie Didn't Know |work= [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date= October 2012 |author= Maureen Orth |url= http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2012/10/katie-holmes-divorce-scientology }} {{inconsistent citations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of psychiatry===
In January 2004, Cruise made the controversial statement "I think psychiatry should be outlawed."&lt;ref name=Desai&gt;{{cite journal|last=Desai|first=Nimesh|title=Antipsychiatry: Meeting the challenge|journal=[[Indian Journal of Psychiatry]] |date=OctoberDecember 2005|volume=47|issue=4|pages=185187|doi=10.4103/0019-5545.43048|pmid=20711302|pmc=2921130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further controversy erupted in 2005 after he openly criticized actress [[Brooke Shields]] for using the drug [[Paxil]] (paroxetine), an [[anti-depressant]] to which Shields attributes her recovery from [[postpartum depression]] after the birth of her first daughter in 2003. Cruise asserted that there is no such thing as a [[chemical imbalance]] and that psychiatry is a form of [[pseudoscience]]. Shields responded that Cruise "should stick to saving the world from aliens and let women who are experiencing postpartum depression decide what treatment options are best for them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Brooke Shields Lashes Out at Tom Cruise|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1067822,00.html|date=June 2, 2005|work= [[People (magazine)|People]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a heated argument between [[Matt Lauer]] and Cruise on NBC's ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' on June 24, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8344309/ |title= In tense moment, Cruise calls Lauer 'glib'| website=[[msnbc.com]]| date= June 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical authorities view Cruise's comments as furthering the social stigma of mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Pemberton|first=Max|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Alien soul theory is no cure for depression|date=April 17, 2006| url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/alternativemedicine/3338404/Alien-soul-theory-is-no-cure-for-depression.html| accessdate= January 20, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Psychotropic drugs: unhelpful and helpful comments| journal=[[The Lancet]] | volume=366| issue=9480| page=96| date= July 9, 2005 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66841-9 | pmid= 16010708| last1=The Lancet }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shields herself called Cruise's comments "a disservice to mothers everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shields |first=Brooke|authorlink=Brooke Shields |work= The New York Times|title=War of Words |date=July 1, 2005 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/01/opinion/01shields.html | accessdate=January 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late August 2006, Cruise apologized in person to Shields for his comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Shields: Cruise apology was 'heartfelt{{'-}}|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-09-02-shields-cruise_x.htm|date=September 2, 2006|work=[[USA Today]]|agency=Associated Press|postscript=|accessdate=June 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology is well known for its opposition to mainstream psychiatry and the [[psychoactive drug]]s which are routinely prescribed for treatment.&lt;ref name="vanity"/&gt;  It was reported that Cruise's anti-psychiatry actions led to a rift with director Steven Spielberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.myway.com/celebgossip/pgsix/id/09_21_2005_1.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050930235723/http://entertainment.myway.com/celebgossip/pgsix/id/09_21_2005_1.html| title=Spielberg in Cruise Meltdown|archivedate=September 30, 2005|work=myway.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg had reportedly mentioned in Cruise's presence the name of a doctor friend who prescribed psychiatric medication. Shortly thereafter, the doctor's office was picketed by Scientologists, reportedly angering Spielberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/07/24/hollywood-ending|title=Hollywood Ending|first= Ken |last= Auletta|date=July 24, 2006|work= [[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===YouTube video removal===
{{main article|Project Chanology#Tom Cruise video}}
On January 15, 2008, a video produced by the Church of Scientology featuring an interview with Cruise was posted on YouTube, showing Cruise discussing what being a Scientologist means to him.&lt;ref name="warne"&gt;{{cite news | last =Warne | first =Dan | title ='Anonymous' threatens to 'dismantle' Church of Scientology via internet | work=[[APC Magazine]] | publisher=[[National Nine News]] | date =January 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="knbc"&gt;{{cite news | title =Hacker Group Declares War On Scientology: Group Upset Over Church's Handling Of Tom Cruise Video | publisher=[[KNBC]] |location=Los Angeles| date =January 24, 2008 | url =http://www.knbc.com/news/15132759/detail.html | accessdate =January 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of Scientology said the video had been "pirated and edited", and was taken from a three-hour video produced for members of Scientology.&lt;ref name="knbc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Church of Scientology Slams German Tabloid"&gt;{{cite news | title =Report: Church of Scientology Slams German Tabloid for Publishing Comments Comparing Tom Cruise to Nazi Minister |publisher=[[Fox News]] | date =January 23, 2008 | url =http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,324885,00.html | accessdate =January 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; YouTube removed the Cruise video from their site under threat of litigation.&lt;ref name="vamosi anonymous hackers"&gt;{{cite news | last =Vamosi | first =Robert | title =Anonymous hackers take on the Church of Scientology | work=[[CNET News]] | publisher=CNET Networks, Inc. | date =January 24, 2008 | url =http://www.news.com/8301-10789_3-9857666-57.html | accessdate =January 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After YouTube investigated this claim, they found that the video did not breach copyright law, as it is covered by the [[fair use]] clause. It was subsequently reinstated on the site, and as of November 2017, the video has achieved over 12 million views. YouTube has declined to remove it again, due to the popularity of the video, and subsequent changes to copyright policy of the website.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFBZ_uAbxS0 Tom Cruise Scientology Video  (Original UNCUT)].

===Scientology's purported influence on Cruise's relationships===
{{see also|#Relationships}}
In 2013, Cruise stated that ex-wife Katie Holmes divorced him in part to protect the couple's daughter Suri from Scientology. He also said that Suri is no longer a practicing member of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tom Cruise Admits Katie Holmes Divorced Him To Protect Suri From Scientology|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/08/tom-cruise-katie-holmes-protect-suri-scientology_n_4240715.html?ir=Entertainment | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | first=Stephanie|last=Marcus|date=November 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2004, his publicist of 14 years, Pat Kingsley, resigned. Cruise's next publicist was Lee Anne DeVette, Cruise's sister, who was herself a Scientologist.  She served in that role until November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117932447?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |title=Cruise will go with pro|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Chris|last=Gardner|date= November 6, 2005|accessdate=October 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeVette was replaced with Paul Bloch from the publicity firm [[Rogers &amp; Cowan|Rogers and Cowan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://entertainment.tv.yahoo.com/entnews/eo/20051108/113151894008.html|title=Cruise Control Shifts Gears|date=November 8, 2005|work=Yahoo!

The 2015 documentary ''[[Going Clear (film)|Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief]]'' cast a spotlight on Cruise's role in Scientology. The film alleges that Cruise used [[Sea Org]] workers as a source of free labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/tom-cruises-secret-scientology-girlfriend-nazanin-boniadi-2015-3|title=Tom Cruise's secret Scientology girlfriend Nazanin Boniadi|date=April 1, 2015|work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Cruise's former auditor [[Marty Rathbun]] claims that wife [[Nicole Kidman]] was wiretapped on Tom Cruise's suggestion (which Cruise's lawyer denies).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11370754/Scientology-leaders-ordered-Nicole-Kidman-wiretap-during-Tom-Cruise-marriage.html|title=Scientology leaders 'ordered Nicole Kidman wiretap' during Tom Cruise marriage|date=January 26, 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/618897/controversial-scientology-documentary-alleges-tom-cruise-wiretapped-nicole-kidman-s-phone-church-slams-claims|title=Controversial Scientology Documentary Alleges Tom Cruise Wiretapped Nicole Kidman's Phone, Church Slams Claims|work=E!

In August 2006, Paramount cited Cruise's "recent conduct" as the reason they did not renew their production contract with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=San Diego Union-Tribune |title=Paramount Drops Cruise |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060823/news_lz1n23pubeye.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203104708/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060823/news_lz1n23pubeye.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 3, 2009 |date=August 23, 2006 |accessdate=January 20, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Marketing Evaluations reported that Cruise's [[Q score]] (a measure of the popularity of celebrities), had fallen 40 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q Scores: Tom Cruise's popularity has dropped|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/entertainment/2006-08/29/content_676908.htm|work=[[China Daily]]|date= August 29, 2006|accessdate=May 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WSJ: What Tom Cruise's "Q scores" reveal|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlla/wsj-what-tom-cruises-q-scores-reveal_b2086|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130629205642/http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlla/wsj-what-tom-cruises-q-scores-reveal_b2086|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 29, 2013|accessdate=May 6, 2013|date=May 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Tom Cruise Picture"===
While reviewing ''[[Days of Thunder]]'', film critic [[Roger Ebert]] noted the similarities between several of Cruise's 1980s films and nicknamed the formula the ''Tom Cruise Picture''. Some of Cruise's later films like ''[[A Few Good Men]]'' and ''[[The Last Samurai]]'' can also be considered to be part of this formula.

''Widescreenings'' noted that for Tom Cruise's character Daniel Kaffee in ''[[A Few Good Men]]'', screenwriter "[[Aaron Sorkin]] interestingly takes the opposite approach of ''[[Top Gun]]'', where Cruise also starred as the protagonist. In ''Top Gun'', Cruise plays Mitchell who is a 'hot shot' military underachiever who makes mistakes because he is trying to outperform his late father. Where Maverick Mitchell needs to rein in the discipline, Daniel Kaffee needs to let it go, finally see what he can do." Sorkin and director [[Rob Reiner]] are praised in gradually unveiling Kaffee's potential in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.widescreenings.com/few-good-men-analysis-review.html|title=Review and analysis: A Few Good Men|first=Inspired by R.

==Litigation==
During Cruise's marriage to Nicole Kidman, the couple endured a great deal of public speculation about their sex life and rumors that Cruise was gay. In 1998, he successfully sued the ''[[Daily Express]]'', a British tabloid which alleged that his marriage to Kidman was a [[sham marriage|sham]] designed to cover up his homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/203779.stm |title=Cruise and Kidman win libel case |publisher=BBC News |date=October 29, 1998 |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2001, he filed a lawsuit against gay porn actor Chad Slater. Slater had allegedly told the celebrity magazine ''[[Actustar]]'' that he had been involved in an affair with Cruise. This claim was strongly denied by Cruise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Simon|title=Cruise sues porn star over gay love claims|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1329163/Cruise-sues-porn-star-over-gay-love-claims.html|accessdate=May 6, 2013|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=May 4, 2001|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in August 2001, Slater was ordered to pay $10&amp;nbsp;million to Cruise in damages after Slater declared he could not afford to defend himself against the suit and would therefore default.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/2664159.stm |title=Cruise wins 'gay' claims legal battle |publisher=BBC News |date=January 16, 2003 |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cruise also sued ''Bold Magazine'' publisher Michael Davis, who alleged but never confirmed that he had video that would prove Cruise was gay. The suit was dropped in exchange for a public statement by Davis that the video was not of Cruise, and that Cruise was heterosexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/1686039.stm |title=Cruise gay claims dropped |publisher=BBC News |date=December 1, 2001 |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Cruise sued [[cybersquatting|cybersquatter]] Jeff Burgar to obtain control of the TomCruise.com domain name. When owned by Burgar, the domain redirected to information about Cruise on Celebrity1000.com. The decision to turn TomCruise.com over to Cruise was handed down by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) on July 5, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Arbitration and Mediation Center |url=http://arbiter.wipo.int/domains/decisions/html/2006/d2006-0560.html |title=WIPO Domain Name Decision: D2006-0560 |website=Arbiter.wipo.int |date=July 5, 2006 |accessdate=August 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
