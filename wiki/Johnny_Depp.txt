Depp moved frequently during his childhood. He and his siblings lived in more than 20 different places, eventually settling in [[Miramar, Florida]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=tca&gt;Stated on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Depp's parents divorced in 1978 when he was 15.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt;&lt;ref name=people1999&gt;{{cite journal | title = Keeping His Head | first = Kyle | last = Smith | work = [[People (magazine)|People]] | date = December 13, 1999 | url = http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20130037,00.html | accessdate = June 19, 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120622035739/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20130037,00.html | archivedate = June 22, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother married Robert Palmer, whom Depp has called "an inspiration to me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/5635464/Johnny-Depp-interview-for-Public-Enemies.html|title=Johnny Depp interview for Public Enemies|last=Hiscock|first=John|date=June 25, 2009|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK|accessdate=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the gift of a guitar from his mother when he was 12, Depp began playing in various [[garage band]]s.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; A year after his parents' divorce, he dropped out of [[Miramar High School]] to become a rock musician.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; He attempted to go back to school two weeks later, but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; He played with The Kids, a band that enjoyed modest local success.

On December 20, 1983, Depp married Lori Anne Allison,&lt;ref name=peoplebio /&gt; the sister of his band's bass player and singer. During their marriage she worked as a makeup artist while he worked a variety of odd jobs, including a [[telemarketing|telemarketer]] for pens. His wife introduced him to actor [[Nicolas Cage]], who advised him to pursue an acting career.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; Depp and his wife divorced in 1985.&lt;ref name=peoplebio /&gt;

==Acting career==

===1984-1993: Early film roles and ''21 Jump Street''===
[[File:Johnny Depp Cannes nineties.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Depp at the [[1992 Cannes Film Festival]]]]
Depp's first film role was in the horror film ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (1984), in which he played the boyfriend of heroine [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy Thompson]] ([[Heather Langenkamp]]) and one of [[Freddy Krueger]]'s victims.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; After a starring role in the comedy ''[[Private Resort]]'' (1985), Depp was cast in the lead role of the skating drama ''[[Thrashin']]'' (1986) by the film's director, but the decision was later overridden by its producer.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;
{{cite AV media |title= [[Thrashin' (film)|Thrashin']] |origyear= 1986 |last=Winters |first=David |authorlink=David Winters (choreographer) |type=Commentary track |publisher=MGM Home Video |year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adam Tyner"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Depp appeared in a minor supporting role as a [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]-speaking private in [[Oliver Stone]]'s [[Vietnam War]] drama ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (1986).

Depp became a popular [[teen idol]] during the late 1980s, when he starred as a police officer who goes on an undercover operation in a high school in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television series ''[[21 Jump Street]]'', which premiered in 1987.&lt;ref name=tca/&gt; He accepted this role to work with actor [[Frederic Forrest]], who inspired him. Despite his success, Depp felt that the series "forced [him] into the role of product."&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news |agency=Reuters | title=It's a pirates life for Johnny Depp |url=http://www.sify.com/movies/it-s-a-pirates-life-for-johnny-depp-news-hollywood-kkfvj7chfdisi.html |publisher=[[Sify]] |date=July 4, 2006 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently decided to appear only in films that he felt were right for him.&lt;ref name="reuters" /&gt; 
Depp's first film release in 1990 was [[John Waters]]' ''[[Cry-Baby]]'', a musical comedy set in the 1950s. Although it was not a box office success upon its initial release, over the years it has gained a [[cult classic]] status. Depp's second 1990 film was [[Tim Burton]]'s film ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'', in which he played the title character opposite [[Dianne Wiest]] and [[Winona Ryder]]. It was a critical and commercial success that established him as a leading Hollywood actor{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} and began his long association with Burton. Producer [[Scott Rudin]] has stated that "basically Johnny Depp is playing Tim Burton in all his movies";{{sfn|Burton|Salisbury|2006|pp=177178}} although Burton disapproved of the comment, Depp agrees with it. In his introduction to ''Burton on Burton'', a book of interviews with the director, Depp called Burton "...&amp;nbsp;a brother, a friend,&amp;nbsp;... and [a] brave soul".{{sfn|Burton|Salisbury|2006|p=}}

Depp had no film releases in the following two years, with the exception of a brief cameo in ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]'' (1991), the sixth installment in the ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare of Elm Street]]'' franchise. He appeared in three films in 1993. In the romantic comedy ''[[Benny and Joon]]'', he played an eccentric and illiterate silent film fan who befriends a mentally ill woman and her brother; it became a [[sleeper hit]]. He then starred alongside [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Juliette Lewis]] in [[Lasse Hallstrm]]'s ''[[What's Eating Gilbert Grape]]'', a drama about a dysfunctional family. In his review of the film, Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said that "Depp manages to command center screen with a greatly affable, appealing characterization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117902133.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1|title=What's Eating Gilbert Grape Review|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|date=December 6, 1993|work=Variety|accessdate=December 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depp's final 1993 release was [[Emir Kusturica]]'s [[surrealist]] comedy-drama ''[[Arizona Dream]]'', which opened to positive reviews.

===19942002: A Character Actor===
[[File:Johnny Depp Jim Jarmusch Cannes 1995.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Depp with director-screenwriter [[Jim Jarmusch]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1995]]
In 1994, Depp reunited with director Tim Burton, playing the title role in ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', a biographical film about one of history's most inept film directors. Depp later stated that he was at the time depressed about films and filmmaking, but that "within 10 minutes of hearing about the project, I was committed."&lt;ref name="Arnold, Gary"&gt;{{cite news |last=Arnold |first=Gary |title=Depp sees promise in cult filmmaker Ed Wood's story |work=The Washington Times |date=October 2, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the role gave him a "chance to stretch out and have some fun" and that working with [[Martin Landau]], who played [[Bela Lugosi]], "rejuvenated my love for acting".&lt;ref name="Arnold, Gary" /&gt; ''Ed Wood'' received critical acclaim, with [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' writing that Depp had "proved himself as an established, certified great actor" and "captured all the can-do optimism that kept Ed Wood going, thanks to an extremely funny ability to look at the silver lining of any cloud."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Janet Maslin | author-link = Janet Maslin | title = Film Festival Review; Ode to a Director Who Dared to Be Dreadful | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = September 23, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depp was nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor  Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] for his performance.

The following year, Depp starred in three films. He played opposite [[Marlon Brando]] in the box-office hit ''[[Don Juan DeMarco]]'', as a man who believes he is [[Don Juan]], the world's greatest lover. He then starred in [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s ''[[Dead Man]]'', a [[Western (genre)|Western]] shot entirely in [[black-and-white]]; it was not a commercial success and had mixed critical reviews. Depp's final film of the year was in the financial and critical failure ''[[Nick of Time (film)|Nick of Time]]'', a thriller in which he played an accountant who is told to kill a politician to save his kidnapped daughter.

In 1997, Depp starred alongside [[Al Pacino]] in the crime drama ''[[Donnie Brasco (film)|Donnie Brasco]]'', directed by [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]]. He portrayed [[Joseph D. Pistone]], an undercover FBI Agent who assumes the name 'Donnie Brasco' in order to infiltrate [[American Mafia|the mafia]] in New York City. To prepare for the role, Depp spent time with the real-life Joe Pistone, on whose memoirs the film was based. ''Donnie Brasco'' was a commercial and critical success, and is considered to contain one of Depp's finest performances.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In 1997, Depp also debuted as a director and screenwriter with ''[[The Brave (film)|The Brave]]''. He starred in it as a poor Native American man, who accepts a proposal from a wealthy man, played by Marlon Brando, to appear in a [[snuff film]] in exchange for money for his family.

Depp was a fan and friend of writer [[Hunter S. Thompson]], and played his alter ego [[Raoul Duke]] in ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' (1998), [[Terry Gilliam]]'s film adaptation of Thompson's pseudobiographical [[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas|novel of the same name]].{{efn| Depp accompanied Thompson as his road manager on one of the author's last book tours.&lt;ref name="contactmusic"&gt;{{cite web | work=ContactMusic | title = Depp was ray for thompson book tour | url = http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/depp%20was%20ray%20for%20thompson%20book%20tour_1001455 | accessdate =July 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he contributed a foreword to ''[[Gonzo: Photographs by Hunter S. Thompson]]'', a posthumous biography published by ammobooks.com, and in 2008 narrated the documentary film ''[[Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson]]''. Following Thompson's suicide in 2005, Depp paid for most of his memorial event in his hometown of [[Aspen, Colorado]].
