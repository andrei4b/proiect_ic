His run to the French quarterfinals launched him into the top 15 for the first time in his career.&lt;ref name=RF2001&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Roger-Federer.aspx?t=pa&amp;y=2001&amp;m=s&amp;e=0|title=Roger Federer  2001 Singles Playing Activity|publisher=[[ATP World Tour]]|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His international breakthrough came at the [[2001 Wimbledon Championships]], where a 19-year-old Federer faced the four-time defending champion and all-time Grand Slam leader [[Pete Sampras]].

Federer's breakthrough at Wimbledon signaled the record-breaking dominance he would display at the All England Club over the next two decades.

The first final he reached at the prestigious [[Masters 1000|Masters]] level came at the 2002 Miami Masters event, where he lost to former and future No. 1 [[Andre Agassi]] on hard court.&lt;ref name=RF2002&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Roger-Federer.aspx?t=pa&amp;y=2002&amp;m=s&amp;e=0|title=Roger Federer   2002 Singles Playing Activity|publisher=[[ATP World Tour]]|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer won his first Master Series event at the [[2002 Hamburg Masters]] on clay, over [[Marat Safin]]; the victory put him in top 10 for the first time.&lt;ref name=RF2002/&gt; Federer made 10 singles finals between 1998 and 2002, of which he won four and lost six.&lt;ref name=RF2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=RF2002/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Roger-Federer.aspx?t=pa&amp;y=1998&amp;m=s&amp;e=0|title=Roger Federer  1998 Singles Playing Activity|publisher=[[ATP World Tour]]|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Roger-Federer.aspx?t=pa&amp;y=1999&amp;m=s&amp;e=0|title=Roger Federer  1999 Singles Playing Activity|publisher=[[ATP World Tour]]|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RF2001/&gt; He also made six finals in doubles.

===2003: Grand slam breakthrough at Wimbledon===
{{Main article|2003 Roger Federer tennis season}}
In 2003, Federer won his first Grand Slam singles title at [[2003 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], beating [[Andy Roddick]] in the semifinals and [[Mark Philippoussis]] in the final.&lt;ref name=RF2003&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Roger-Federer.aspx?t=pa&amp;y=2003&amp;m=s&amp;e=0|title=Roger Federer  2003 Singles Playing Activity|publisher=[[ATP World Tour]]|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August he had a chance to take over the No. 1 ranking for the first time from [[Andre Agassi]] if he made it to the Montreal final.

Federer won his first and to date only doubles Masters Series 1000 event in Miami with Max Mirnyi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Roger-Federer.aspx?t=pa&amp;y=2003&amp;m=d&amp;e=0|author=ATP|title=Roger Federer 2003 Doubles|accessdate=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made it to one singles Masters Series 1000 event in Rome on clay, which he lost.&lt;ref name=RF2003/&gt; Federer made it to nine finals on the ATP Tour and won seven of them, including the 500 series events at Dubai and Vienna.&lt;ref name=RF2003/&gt; Lastly, Federer won the year-end championships over Andre Agassi, finishing the year as world No. 2, narrowly behind Andy Roddick by only 160 points.&lt;ref name=RF2003/&gt;

===2004: Imposing dominance===

{{Main article|2004 Roger Federer tennis season}}
During 2004, Federer won three Grand Slam singles titles for the first time in his career and became the first person to do so since [[Mats Wilander]] in 1988. His first major hard-court title came at the [[2004 Australian Open|Australian Open]] over [[Marat Safin]], thereby becoming the world No. 1 for the first time. He then won his [[2004 Wimbledon Championships|second Wimbledon crown]] over [[Andy Roddick]].&lt;ref name=RF2004&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Roger-Federer.aspx?t=pa&amp;y=2004&amp;m=s&amp;e=0|title=Roger Federer  2004 Singles Playing Activity|publisher=[[ATP World Tour]]|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer defeated the [[2001 US Open (tennis)|2001 US Open]] champion, [[Lleyton Hewitt]], at the [[2004 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] for his first title there.&lt;ref name=RF2004/&gt;

Federer won three ATP Masters Series 1000 events, one was on clay in Hamburg, and the other two were on hard surfaces at Indian Wells and in Canada.&lt;ref name=RF2004/&gt; Federer took the ATP 500 series event at Dubai and wrapped up the year by winning the year-end championships for the second time.&lt;ref name=RF2004/&gt; He also won his first tournament on home soil by capturing the [[Swiss Open (tennis)|Swiss Open]] in Gstaad. His 11 singles titles were the most of any player in two decades, and his record of 746 was the best since [[Ivan Lendl]] in 1986. He reached the year-end No. 1 ranking for the first time.

===2005: Consolidating dominance===
{{Main article|2005 Roger Federer tennis season}}
In 2005, Federer failed to reach the finals of the first two Grand Slam tournaments, losing the Australian Open semifinal to eventual champion Safin after holding match points, and the French Open semifinal to eventual champion [[Rafael Nadal]].&lt;ref name=RF2005/&gt; However, Federer quickly reestablished his dominance on grass, winning the [[2005 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon Championships]] over [[Andy Roddick]]. At the [[2005 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Federer defeated [[Andre Agassi]] in the latter's last major final.&lt;ref name=RF2005&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Roger-Federer.aspx?t=pa&amp;y=2005&amp;m=s&amp;e=0|title=Roger Federer  2005 Singles Playing Activity|publisher=[[ATP World Tour]]|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federer also took four ATP Masters Series 1000 wins: Indian Wells, Miami and Cincinnati on hard court, and Hamburg on clay.&lt;ref name=RF2005/&gt; The win in Miami was particularly noteworthy as it was the first final contested between Federer and Nadal. Federer recovered from two sets and a break down to take the final in five sets. Furthermore, Federer won two ATP 500 series events at Rotterdam and Dubai.&lt;ref name=RF2005/&gt; Federer lost the year-end championships to [[David Nalbandian]] in five sets while playing through a foot injury that sidelined him for almost the rest of the season after September.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/4336738.stm&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained his position as No. 1 for the entire season.&lt;ref name=RF2005/&gt;

Federer won 11 singles titles, which ties his 2004 season. Federer's 81 match victories were the most since [[Pete Sampras]] in 1993, and his record of 814 (95.2%) remains the third-best winning percentage in the Open Era behind [[John McEnroe]]'s 1984 and [[Jimmy Connors]]'s 1974.

===2006: Outstanding season===

In 2006, Federer won three Grand Slam singles titles and reached the final of the other, with the only loss coming against Nadal in the [[2006 French Open|French Open]].

In the [[2006 Australian Open|Australian Open]], Federer defeated [[Marcos Baghdatis]],&lt;ref name=RF2006/&gt; and at the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Federer defeated Roddick (2003 champion).&lt;ref name=RF2006/&gt; In addition, Federer made it to six ATP Masters Series 1000 finals, winning four on hard surfaces and losing two on clay to Nadal. Federer, however, consistently pushed Nadal to the limit on clay throughout the season taking him to fourth-set tiebreakers in Monte-Carlo and Paris, and a thrilling match in Rome that went to a deciding fifth-set tiebreaker.

Federer won one ATP 500 series event in Tokyo and captured the year-end championships for the third time in his career, again finishing the year as world No. 1.&lt;ref name=RF2006/&gt; Federer only lost to two players during 2006, to Nadal four times in finals, and to 19-year-old [[Andy Murray]] in the second round of the [[2006 Cincinnati Masters]], in what would be Federer's only defeat before reaching the final of a tournament that year. Federer finished the season on a 29-match winning streak, as well as winning 48 of his last 49 matches after the French Open.

A personal highlight for Federer came near the end of the season when he won his hometown tournament, the [[Swiss Indoors]] in Basel, Switzerland for the first time, having finished runners up in 2000 and 2001, and missing the tournament in 2004 and 2005 due to injuries.

===2007: Holding off young rivals===
{{Main article|2007 Roger Federer tennis season}}
In 2007, Federer reached all four Grand Slam singles finals, winning three of them again. He won the [[2007 Australian Open|Australian Open]] without dropping a set, beating [[Fernando Gonzlez]] in the final. This made him the first man in the 21st century to accomplish the feat, as [[Bjrn Borg]] at the 1980 French Open was the last to win a Grand Slam tournament without the loss of a set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/aus07/news/story?id=2744992|title=Federer defeats Gonzalez for 10th Grand Slam title|date=28 January 2007|publisher=ESPN|access-date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer had entered the year on a huge winning streak and after capturing his fourth Dubai crown Federer's winning streak stood at 41 matches, the longest of his career and only five shy of the record. Federer entered Indian Wells as the three-time defending champion, but his streak would end in controversy. He was defeated by an Argentine, [[Guillermo Caas]], who had failed a drug test for illegal doping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Bonnie DeSimone|title=Canas keeps the ball in court in doping case|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=2819004|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=5 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:The Mighty Federer cropped.jpg|thumb|Federer was coined "Darth Federer" by fans and commentators at the 2007 US Open]]  This surprising first-round defeat marked the first time since August 2006 he suffered defeat, a period spanning over seven months.

During the clay season, Federer's victory in the Hamburg Masters final was particularly impressive, as it snapped Nadal's 81-match winning streak on clay, an Open-era record. Federer turned the match around from a set down to sweep 12 of the final 14 games, including a final set [[Bagel (tennis)|bagel]]. At the French Open, some anticipated that Federer could become the first man in almost 40 years to hold all four majors simultaneously, having just resoundingly defeated young rival Nadal on clay entering the tournament. However, in a repeat of the previous year Federer played a tough four-set final against Nadal, but was undone by going 1/17 on break-point chances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/scores/2007/520/MS001/match-stats|title=R. Nadal vs. R. Federer Paris 2007 Finals  Match Stats  ATP World Tour  Tennis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[2007 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], Federer entered the tournament not only as the four-time defending champion, but also riding a 48-match winning streak on grass. Once again, he defeated Rafael Nadal for a second consecutive year in the final, this time in a [[2007 Wimbledon Championships  Men's Singles final|thrilling five-set encounter]] that many analysts hailed as the greatest Wimbledon final since [[1980 Wimbledon Championships  Men's Singles final|1980]]. Victory at Wimbledon equaled him with [[Bjrn Borg]] for the record of five consecutive championships at the [[All England Club]].

Federer reached the final in Montreal before playing a young and relatively unknown Serbian named [[Novak Djokovic]]. Djokovic proved his potential by stunning the world No. 1 in a final-set tiebreaker upset. Federer rebounded in Cincinnati to capture his fifth title of the year. Federer entered the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] as the three-time defending champion and faced Djokovic in the final. This time, Federer prevailed in a close straight-set match. Victory in New York moved him ahead of Laver and Borg for third on the all-time list of major championship victories. Throughout the tournament, the American press labelled him Darth Federer for his all-black attire (which included tuxedo-striped shorts) and the tournament played [[The Imperial March]] from [[Star Wars]] when he was announced onto the court for each of his matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tennis-x.com/xblog/2007-09-09/297.php|title=Darth Federer Eyes 12th Slam Today Against Djokovic|last=Tennis-X.com|website=tennis-x.com|access-date=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would close out the year with victories in [[Swiss Indoors|Basel]] and the [[ATP World Tour Finals|Year End Championships]] in Shanghai.

He finished the season as the year-end No. 1 for the fourth year in a row, demonstrating his dominance, and during these four years he won 11 Grand Slam singles titles. After his phenomenal triple Grand Slam season yet again, Federer became the only player in history to win three Majors in a year for three years (2004, 2006, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/event_guide/history/men_s_singles.html |title=Australian Open Men's Singles Champions |publisher=Australian Open |accessdate=15 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115064147/http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/event_guide/history/men_s_singles.html |archivedate=15 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rolandgarros.com/en_FR/about/history/pastwinners.html |title=Roland Garros Men's Singles Past Winners 18912011 |publisher=Roland Garros |accessdate=9 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513071553/http://www.rolandgarros.com/en_FR/about/history/pastwinners.html |archivedate=13 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aeltc2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/rolls/menroll.html |title=Wimbledon Men's Singles Finals |publisher=Wimbledon|accessdate=15 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usopen.org/en_US/about/history/mschamps.html |title=US Open Men's Singles Finals |publisher=US Open |accessdate=15 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222190523/http://www.usopen.org/en_US/about/history/mschamps.html |archivedate=22 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the third consecutive season that Federer would hold the No. 1 ranking for all 52 weeks of the year.

===2008: Illness, fifth US Open and Olympic Gold===
{{Main article|2008 Roger Federer tennis season}}
Federer's success in 2008 was severely hampered by a lingering bout of [[mononucleosis]], which he suffered from during the first half of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federer battles off-court foe  mononucleosis|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/07/sports/07iht-arena.3.10811374.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|date=7 March 2008|accessdate=25 October 2014|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the year, he suffered a back injury that prove to be recurring throughout his career.

In 2008, Federer captured one Grand Slam, a singles title at the [[2008 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] over Andy Murray.&lt;ref name=RF2008&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Roger-Federer.aspx?t=pa&amp;y=2008&amp;m=s&amp;e=0|title=Roger Federer  2008 Singles Playing Activity|publisher=[[ATP World Tour]]|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer was defeated by Nadal in two Grand Slam finals, the [[2008 French Open|French Open]] and [[2008 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], which was regarded as the best match of tennis history by many, when he was going for six straight wins to break [[Bjrn Borg]]'s record.&lt;ref name=RF2008/&gt; At the [[2008 Australian Open|Australian Open]], Federer lost in the semifinals to eventual winner Djokovic, which ended his record of 10 consecutive finals.&lt;ref name=RF2008/&gt; He lost twice in Masters Series 1000 finals on clay to Nadal, at Monte Carlo and Hamburg.&lt;ref name=RF2008/&gt; Federer captured three titles in 250-level events at Estoril, Halle, and Basel.

At the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]], Federer and [[Stan Wawrinka]] won the gold medal in doubles, after beating the [[Bryan brothers]] American team in the semifinals and the Swedish duo of [[Simon Aspelin]] and [[Thomas Johansson]] in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Specials/Roger_Federer/News/Federer_and_Wawrinka_golden_together.html?cid=62174|title=Federer and Wawrinka golden together
|accessdate=16 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Federer could only reach the quarterfinals in the singles draw, bowing out to then No. 8 [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]], succumbing his No. 1 ranking to Nadal after being at the top for a record 237 consecutive weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Roger-Federer.aspx?t=pa&amp;y=2008&amp;m=d&amp;e=0|author=ATP|title=Roger Federer 2008 Doubles|accessdate=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended the year ranked No. 2.

===2009: Career Grand Slam, and major title record===
{{Main article|2009 Roger Federer tennis season}}

Federer entered the 2009 season with 13 Grand Slams, only one behind Pete Sampras' all-time record. The season began with a loss to Nadal in the final of the Australian Open in a hotly contested five-set match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/feb/01/rafael-nadal-roger-federer-australian-open|title=Nadal wins battle for place in history by edging past Federer in Melbourne|accessdate=1 February 2009 | location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Steve|last=Bierley|date=1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer struggled following the defeat in Melbourne and entered the clay season without a title.
[[File:FedererRolandGarros.jpg|thumb|left|Federer winning the French Open, and completing the career Grand Slam.]]

Federer's season turned around in the final masters event of the clay season when he defeated Nadal on clay for only the second time to capture the [[Madrid Open (tennis)|Madrid Masters]].&lt;ref name=RF2009/&gt; Federer entered the French Open with few predicting him to win the elusive Parisian title having lost to Nadal in the final weekend for the past four seasons. After Nadal's unexpected defeat to [[Robin Sderling]], Federer suddenly became the overwhelming favorite. It would not be easy as, in his next match, he was forced to come from two sets and break point down in the third set to defeat [[Tommy Haas]] in five sets.&lt;ref name=RF2009&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/players/roger-federer/f324/player-activity?year=2009|title=Roger Federer  Player Activity|publisher=[[ATP World Tour]]|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also forced to fight back from a two-sets-to-one deficit against a young [[Juan Martn del Potro]] to win a five setter in the semifinals.&lt;ref name=RF2009/&gt; In [[2009 French Open  Men's singles final|the final]], he faced Sderling, and with straight sets victory, he finally captured the [[Coupe des Mousquetaires]] and career Grand Slam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/08/sports/tennis/08tennis.html|title=The Greatest? Federer's Victory Fills Last Hole on His Rsum|accessdate=26 February 2017 | location=Paris|work=The New York Times|first=Christopher|last=Clarey|date=7 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This victory also tied him with Pete Sampras for the most Grand Slam singles titles.

Federer immediately turned his sights to the grass courts of Wimbledon, where he breezed his way up to the final. In the championship match he faced long-time rival [[Andy Roddick]] in what would be their eighth and final meeting at a Grand Slam. Roddick pushed Federer into a record-setting fifth set, which Federer claimed 1614 to win his 15th Grand Slam singles title, breaking the all-time record of Pete Sampras.

Federer continued his summer run by winning his third title on the lightning-fast courts of the [[Cincinnati Masters]], defeating Novak Djokovic in the final.&lt;ref name=RF2009/&gt; At the US Open he defeated Sderling in the quarters and Djokovic, for the third consecutive year, in the semifinals. On the penultimate point of the Djokovic match he hit what many consider to be the greatest shot of his career, a [[Tweener (tennis)|tweener]] winner, to set up match points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMJ0-1GGf5k|title=Roger Federer  Tweener  US Open 2009 [HD]|last=penabaza|date=21 December 2011|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer played del Potro in the final and led two sets to one before ultimately losing a fourth-set tiebreaker and subsequently the match.&lt;ref name=RF2009/&gt;

The 2009 season was perhaps the most historically relevant of Federer's career as he completed a career Grand Slam by winning his first French Open title and won a men's record fifteenth Grand Slam singles title at Wimbledon, surpassing Pete Sampras's mark of fourteen.&lt;ref name=RF2009/&gt; The [[2009 Wimbledon Championships  Men's Singles|Wimbledon final]] was also historic for being the longest Grand Slam final in terms of games played with Federer prevailing 1614 in the fifth set. 

Federer finished the season as the year-end No. 1 for the fifth time in his career.

===2010: Fourth Australian Open===
{{Main article|2010 Roger Federer tennis season}}
[[File:R federer.jpg|thumb|Federer won a record 16th Major at the 2010 Australian Open]]
Federer started the year with a win at the [[2010 Australian Open|Australian Open]],&lt;ref name=RF2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Roger-Federer.aspx?t=pa&amp;y=2010&amp;m=s&amp;e=0|title=Roger Federer  2010 Singles Playing Activity|publisher=[[ATP World Tour]]|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he defeated Andy Murray in the final, extending the Grand Slam singles record to sixteen titles and matching [[Andre Agassi]]'s record of four Australian Open titles.&lt;ref name=RF2008/&gt; Since Wimbledon 2005 Federer had made 18 out of 19 finals in Grand Slam tournaments, a period of sustained excellence unparalleled in the [[History of tennis|Open Era]]. This tournament, however, would mark the end of his utter dominance at the majors.

At the [[2010 French Open|French Open]], Federer won his 700th tour match and 150th tour match on clay.&lt;ref name=RF2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2010/05/Roland-Garros/Roland-Garros-Friday-Federer-Wins-700th-Match.aspx |title=Tennis  ATP World Tour  Roland Garros Friday  Federer Joins 700 Match Wins Club |publisher=ATP World Tour |accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he failed to reach a Grand Slam semifinal for the first time since the [[2004 French Open]], losing to Sderling in the last 8 and relinquishing his No. 1 ranking,&lt;ref name=RF2010/&gt; having been just one week away from equalling [[Pete Sampras]]'s record of 286 weeks as world No. 1.

Federer finished the year in strong form, winning indoor titles at the [[Stockholm Open]], [[Swiss Indoors]], and the [[ATP World Tour Finals]] in London, which brought his tally to 66 career titles. Federer won the year-end championships in London by beating rival Rafael Nadal for his fifth title at the event. He beat all contenders except Nadal in straight sets. It remains the only tournament in his career where Federer defeated all fellow members of the [[Big Four (tennis)|Big Four]]. Since Wimbledon 2010, Federer had a win-loss record of 344. Federer finished in the top two for the eighth consecutive season.

===2011: Tour Finals title record===
{{Main article|2011 Roger Federer tennis season}}

At Wimbledon, Federer advanced to his 29th consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal, losing to [[Jo-Wilfried Tsonga]]. It marked the first time in his career that he had lost a Grand Slam tournament match after winning the first two sets.

At the [[2011 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Federer lost in the semifinals to Novak Djokovic in five sets. In a repeat of previous year's semifinal event, Federer again squandered two match points on his own serve before losing after winning first two sets for second consecutive time in the year.

The 2012 season for Federer had his most match wins since 2006 and his highest winning percentage and number of titles won since 2007.

Federer reached the semifinal of the [[2012 Australian Open]], setting up a 27th career meeting with Nadal, a match he lost in four sets.
He then won the [[2012 ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament|Rotterdam Open]] for the first time since 2005, defeating Juan Martn del Potro. Federer played in the [[2012 Dubai Tennis Championships]], where he defeated Andy Murray in the final and won the championship title for the fifth time in his career. Federer then moved on to the [[2012 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells Masters]], where he defeated Rafael Nadal in the semifinals, and [[John Isner]] in the final. Federer won the title for a record fourth time, and, in doing so, equalled Nadal's record of 19 ATP Masters 1000 titles.
[[File:Federer Wimbledon 2012 Champion.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Federer won a record 17th Major, a record-equaling 7th Wimbledon, and returned to No. 1.]]
Federer went on to compete at the [[2012 Mutua Madrid Open|Madrid Masters]] on the new blue clay surface, where he beat [[Tom Berdych]] in the final, thus regaining the No. 2 ranking from Rafael Nadal. In the [[2012 French Open|French Open]], Federer made the semifinals before losing to Djokovic in straight sets, in a rematch of previous year's semifinal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/18366030|title=Roger Federer|accessdate=8 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609030213/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/18366030|archivedate=9 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013: Injury struggles===
{{Main article|2013 Roger Federer tennis season}}
Federer developed back injuries in March and July and his ranking dropped from No. 2 to No. 6. The 2013 season was the first since 1999 in which Federer failed to reach a final in the first four months of the year.

Federer's first and only title of 2013 came at the [[Gerry Weber Open]] (defeating [[Mikhail Youzhny]]), where he also played doubles with good friend [[Tommy Haas]]. With the victory in [[Halle, North Rhine-Westphalia|Halle]], he tied John McEnroe for the third-most number of ATP titles won by a male player in the Open Era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtennismagazine.com/archives/9421|title=Roger Federer Ties John McEnroe With 77th Career Title In Halle|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer, however, was unable to maintain his form into Wimbledon, suffering his worst Grand Slam tournament defeat since 2003 in the second round against [[Sergiy Stakhovsky]].

During the summer, he experimented with various different racquets and played the [[2013 International German Open|German Open]] with a blacked-out 98-inch Wilson racquet, instead of his regular Pro Staff 6.1 90 BLX racquet with the smaller 90-inch hitting area.

{{Main article|2014 Roger Federer tennis season}}
Federer began the season by changing rackets for the first time in his career, from his longtime frame of 90 square inches to one measured at 97 square inches. He had long been at a comparative disadvantage in equipment as almost the entire tour, including his top rivals Nadal and Djokovic, used more powerful frames of between 95 and 100 square inches.&lt;ref name=2013racquet/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Greg Bishop|title=Seeking Bigger Sweet Spot, Roger Federer Hopes His Racket Will Grow on Him|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/17/sports/tennis/is-change-good-federer-with-new-racket-to-find-out.html|work=The New York Times|date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Australian Open, Federer defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Andy Murray to reach his 11th consecutive semifinal in Melbourne, before losing to Rafael Nadal in straight sets.

Federer defeated Spain's [[David Ferrer]] in three sets to capture his sixth [[2014 Western &amp; Southern Open|Cincinnati]] crown and 22nd [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000]] title, his first in Cincinnati since 2012. He then reached the semifinals at the [[2014 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] but lost in straight sets to eventual champion [[Marin ili]].

In March, Federer won his 25th Masters title at [[2017 BNP Paribas Open  Men's Singles|Indian Wells]], defeating Wawrinka in the final and gaining another victory over Nadal in the 4th round. This was also Federer's 90th career title and he climbed to No. 6 in the ATP rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/federer-sets-new-goals-after-indian-wells-triumph-2017-sunday|title=Federer reassesses goals after Indian Wells triumph|publisher=ATP World Tour|date=20 March 2017|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer collected his 26th Masters title by defeating Nadal in the final of the [[2017 Miami Open  Men's Singles|Miami Masters]] in straight sets and climbed to No. 4 in the ATP rankings. This marked the third time Federer had won in Indian Wells and Miami back-to-back, colloquially referred to as the Sunshine Double (2005, 2006 and 2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/miami-2017-final-federer-nadal|title=Federer Completes Third Sunshine Double With Miami Title|publisher=ATP World Tour|date=2 April 2017|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to concerns about his longevity, Federer decided that he would skip the entire clay-court season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/19389305/roger-federer-skip-french-open-eyes-upcoming-grass-court-season|title=Roger Federer will skip French Open, eyes grass-court season|publisher=ESPN|agency=Associated Press|date=15 May 2017|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He returned to the tour at the beginning of the grass-court season in Stuttgart, where he suffered a shock defeat to Tommy Haas in the second round despite holding match points, the lowest-ranked player (No. 302) to beat him since No. 407 Bjoern Phau in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurosport.co.uk/tennis/atp-stuttgart/2017/roger-federer-returns-with-win-over-tommy-haas-in-stuttgart_sto6216781/story.shtml|title=Roger Federer stunned by Tommy Haas in first game back|publisher=Eurosport|date=14 June 2017|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rebounded the following week by winning a record-extending ninth title at the [[Halle Open|Gerry Weber Open]] in Halle, doing so without the loss of a set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/19731380/roger-federer-claims-92nd-title-tennis-career-victory-gerry-weber-open-halle-germany|title=Roger Federer warms up for Wimbledon with 92nd career title|publisher=ESPN|agency=Associated Press|date= 25 June 2017|accessdate= 26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[2017 Wimbledon Championships  Men's Singles|2017 Wimbledon Championships]], Federer made it to the final without dropping a set, defeating [[Milos Raonic]] in the quarterfinals and [[Tom Berdych]] in the semifinals.

At the opening of the summer hard court swing Federer was defeated in the final of the [[2017 Rogers Cup|Montreal Masters]] by [[Alexander Zverev Jr.|Alexander Zverev]] after injuring his back during the match. Due to the injury, he opted to withdraw from the [[2017 Western &amp; Southern Open|Cincinnati Masters]] to be fit for the [[2017 US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. However, Federer lost to [[Juan Martin Del Potro|del Potro]] in the quarterfinals at the US Open, in a tournament characterized by inconsistent play from Federer, unlike the major portion of the season.

Federer's next participation was in September in the inaugural [[Laver Cup]], representing team Europe. Federer won both his singles matches against [[Sam Querrey]] and [[Nick Kyrgios]], with the latter win sealing the cup for Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lavercup.com/news/2017/09/24/team-europe-wins-laver-cup-epic-federer-victory|title=Team Europe wins Laver Cup after epic Federer victory  Laver Cup|date=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tournament was also notable for Federer playing doubles teaming with longtime rival Nadal for the first time. The two legends emerged victorious against world duo of Sam Querrey and [[Jack Sock]].

At the [[2017 Shanghai Rolex Masters  Singles|Shanghai Masters]], Federer captured his third Masters title of the season, defeating No. 1 Rafael Nadal in the final. This was Federer's fifth straight victory over Nadal in their rivalry and his 94th career title, drawing him level with 2nd-placed Ivan Lendl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enca.com/sport/tennis/federer-wins-shanghai-masters-with-straight-sets-victory-over-nadal|title=Federer wins Shanghai Masters with straight sets victory over Nadal|website=enca.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the indoor season, Federer defeated [[Juan Martin Del Potro]] in the final of his hometown tournament, the Swiss Indoors in Basel, earning a record eighth championship there and winning his 95th career title, surpassing Ivan Lendl in number of career titles. Federer qualified for the [[2017 ATP Finals]], but was beaten by [[David Goffin]] in the semifinals in three sets.

===2018: 20th Grand Slam title and return to world No. 1===
{{main article|2018 Roger Federer tennis season}}

Federer started his season winning the [[2018 Hopman Cup|Hopman Cup]] partnering with [[Belinda Bencic]]. This was his second Hopman Cup title, having won previously in 2001 with [[Martina Hingis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hopmancup.com/2018/01/kerber-zone-level-final/|title=Swiss precision lands third Hopman Cup title  Hopman Cup|date=6 January 2018|work=Hopman Cup|access-date=6 January 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[2018 Australian Open - Men's Singles|2018 Australian Open]], Federer reached the final without dropping a set, and successfully defended his title beating Marin ili in a five-set final. This was Federer's sixth title at the [[Australian Open]], equaling the record held by [[Roy Emerson]] and [[Novak Djokovic]], as well as becoming the first man to win twenty [[List of Grand Slam men's singles champions|Grand Slam]] titles. It was also the first time since the 2008 US Open that Federer successfully defended a major title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roger Federer wins sixth Australian Open and 20th Grand Slam title|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/42851064|website=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In mid-February, Federer won his third [[Rotterdam Open]] title to return to No. 1 in the ATP rankings, officially clinching the spot with a quarterfinal victory over [[Robin Haase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roger Federer, 36, to become oldest No. 1 ever in ATP rankings|url=http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/22468637/roger-federer-returns-top-atp-rankings-oldest-ever-36|website=ESPN|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He beat [[Grigor Dimitrov]] in straight sets in the final. At 36 years and 195 days of age, he became the oldest ATP world No. 1 by more than three years. He also broke the ATP record for the longest span between a player's first and last weeks to attain the No. 1 ranking at 14 years and 17 days apart, as well as the most time between two successive reigns at No. 1 at 5 years and 106 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roger Federer wins Rotterdam Open two days after becoming world No 1|url=http://www.skysports.com/tennis/news/12110/11256610/roger-federer-wins-rotterdam-open-two-days-after-becoming-world-no-1|website=Sky Sports|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, Federer entered the [[2018 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells Masters]] as [[2017 BNP Paribas Open  Men's Singles|the defending champion]]. He defeated [[Chung Hyeon]] in the quarterfinals, ensuring that he retained the [[ATP ranking|world No. 1 ranking]], and [[Borna ori]] in the semifinal, solidifying a career-best start to a season at 170. His previous best season start had been 160 during the 2006 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/indian-wells-2018-saturday-federer-coric|title=Federer Outlasts Coric, Completes Best Start To A Season {{!}} ATP World Tour {{!}} Tennis|work=ATP World Tour|access-date=17 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite holding three championship points, Federer was defeated by [[Juan Martn del Potro|Juan Martin Del Potro]] in a close three-set final. At the [[2018 Miami Open|Miami Open]], Federer received a first-round bye, but lost in the second round to [[Thanasi Kokkinakis]]. With this early exit from the tournament, Federer lost his No. 1 ranking to Nadal on 2 April. He announced that he would miss the clay court season, including the French Open, for the second consecutive season.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/43529911 Miami Open: Roger Federer to lose top spot and miss French Open after defeat, bbc.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he regained the No. 1 ranking in May after Nadal failed to defend one of his Masters titles at the [[2018 Mutua Madrid Open|Madrid Open]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://metro.co.uk/2018/05/11/rafael-nadal-speaks-losing-no-1-ranking-roger-federer-7539548/ | title=Rafael Nadal will lose his world No. 1 ranking to Roger Federer | accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then lost the top spot the following week after Nadal won the title at the [[2018 Italian Open  Men's Singles|Italian Open]].

==National representation==
===Davis Cup===
Federer made his [[Davis Cup]] for [[Switzerland Davis Cup team|Switzerland]] debut in the [[1999 Davis Cup World Group#Switzerland vs. Italy|World Group 1st Round against Italy in 1999]] at 17 years of age. In his first match he defeated [[Davide Sanguinetti]] in four sets and recorded a second singles victory in a dead rubber two days later as Switzerland advanced to the World Group Quarterfinals. In the Quarterfinals Federer, who was still 17 years old, suffered his first Davis Cup loss when he was defeated by Belgian [[Christophe Van Garsse]] in five sets. The Swiss team would go on to lose the rubber 32. A year later, Federer competed in his first Davis Cup doubles rubber where he teamed with countryman [[Lorenzo Manta]] to defeat Australians [[Wayne Arthurs (tennis)|Wayne Arthurs]] and [[Sandon Stolle]] in four sets. Despite the doubles victory, Federer lost both singles rubbers to [[Mark Philippoussis]] and [[Lleyton Hewitt]] which saw Switzerland sent to the World Group Playoffs for the first time in Federer's career. He would return for the playoffs in July 2000 and led Switzerland to a 50 win over [[Belarus Davis Cup team|Belarus]] by recording wins in singles and doubles.

His first Davis Cup highlight came in 2003 as the newly crowned Wimbledon champion led his country to an historic semifinal run. After recording five wins in ties against the [[Netherlands Davis Cup team|Netherlands]] and [[France Davis Cup team|France]], the Swiss team traveled to Melbourne to play the highly rated [[Australia Davis Cup team|Australians]]. Federer once again defeated Wimbledon runner-up [[Mark Philippoussis]] in the second rubber but allowed the Australians to lead the tie 21 going into Day 3 after dropping the doubles rubber in five sets. Federer then played Lleyton Hewitt in a sudden death situation for Switzerland and despite leading two sets to love, succumbed to a fast finishing Hewitt in five sets. Australia would go on to claim the Davis Cup title months later as Federer's interest in Davis Cup began to wane and his focus shifted to his personal career. He would go on to skip many ties over the years but often competed in the World Group Playoffs each year in order for Switzerland to maintain their place in the top division.

The emergence of countryman [[Stanislas Wawrinka]] as a Grand Slam singles champion in 2014 renewed hope for Federer in his Davis Cup quest, and the pair both committed to playing each tie that year. Their commitment would pay off as wins over [[Serbia Davis Cup team|Serbia]], [[Kazakhstan Davis Cup team|Kazakhstan]] and [[Italy Davis Cup team|Italy]] allowed the Swiss team to advance to the [[2014 Davis Cup]] Final. Leading into the final, Federer was suffering from a back injury&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/nov/20/roger-federer-davis-cup-final-switzerland-france-stan-wawrinka|title=Roger Federer's back problem leaves Davis Cup final on knife edge|first=Kevin|last=Mitchell|date=20 November 2014|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; that threw serious doubt over Switzerland's chance to claim the title, and a second rubber straight sets loss to [[Gal Monfils]] seemingly spelled the worst for Switzerland. However, a rejuvenated Federer returned the next day to help claim the doubles rubber, which set up a fourth rubber singles tie between Federer and [[Richard Gasquet]]. Federer defeated Gasquet in straight sets and in doing so handed Switzerland its first (and only to date) Davis Cup title.

Federer holds many Davis Cup records for Switzerland that includes most total wins, most singles wins and most years played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviscup.com/en/teams/team.aspx?id=SUI|title=Davis Cup  Teams|website=daviscup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Olympic Games===
An 18-year-old Federer made his [[Summer Olympics|Olympic]] debut at [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney]] in 2000, where he entered the singles competition. He surprised many by reaching the semifinals but lost to [[Tommy Haas]] in the semifinals and then to [[Arnaud Di Pasquale]] in the bronze medal match, causing Federer to leave Sydney empty handed. At the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]], Federer was the clear favorite after claiming the world No. 1 ranking earlier in the year and capturing the Australian Open and Wimbledon titles. However, he lost in the second round to 18-year-old [[Tom Berdych]]. In doubles, he and compatriot [[Yves Allegro]] lost in the second round. At the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], Federer was again the top seed and favorite, but lost in the quarterfinals to [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]]. However, he found more success on the doubles court, capturing the gold medal in men's doubles with compatriot Stan Wawrinka, defeating [[Simon Aspelin]] and [[Thomas Johansson]] of [[Sweden at the 2008 Summer Olympics|Sweden]]. At both the Athens and Beijing Olympic Games, Federer was the flagbearer for Switzerland in the [[Olympic opening ceremony|opening ceremony]]. At [[2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012]], Federer won his first singles medal, losing to [[Andy Murray]] in the final to claim the silver. He and Wawrinka were unable to defend their gold medal in doubles, losing in the second round to [[Jonathan Erlich]] and [[Andy Ram]] of [[Israel at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Israel]]. Federer did not compete in the [[2016 Summer Olympics|Rio Olympics]] after taking the rest of the season off after [[2016 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] to recover from a knee injury.

===Hopman Cup===
Federer won the 2001 Hopman Cup representing Switzerland, along with Martina Hingis. The duo defeated the American pair of Monica Seles and Jan-Michael Gambill in the finals. Federer would later say that winning the Hopman Cup with Hingis "definitely helped me to become the player I am today."
He played also next year, along with his current wife Mirka Vavrinec, but they lost in the round robin stage.
Federer played again at the Hopman Cup in 2017, along with Belinda Bencic. They won all of their ties but lost the last one, and as a result they couldn't make the final.
In 2018 Federer won his second Hopman Cup title and third overall for Switzerland. His partner was Belinda Bencic once again. The Swiss team won all the ties and Federer won all his singles and mixed doubles matches. They defeated the German pair, Alexander Zverev and Angelique Kerber, in the final with score 21.

==International representation==
===Laver Cup===
One of his most lasting legacies may turn out to be his creation of a new annual tournament called the Laver Cup which pits Europe against the rest of the world. Federer founded the tournament in honor of tennis legend Rod Laver and the inaugural edition was played in 2017.
Federer won the inaugural Laver Cup in 2017, representing team Europe. Federer played his first singles match on day two, where he dispatched Sam Querrey in straight sets. Later on day two, he partnered with his rival Nadal in doubles, where they defeated the Team World duo of Sam Querrey and Jack Sock in the match tie breaker, which took place at one set all. This was the first time Federer and Nadal competed on the same side of a doubles match. On day three, Federer competed in the final match of the tournament, where he sealed victory for Team Europe by defeating Nick Kyrgios in the champion's tiebreak (saving a match point). With three wins and seven points, Federer was the most accomplished player of the tournament.

They are the only pair of men to have ever finished six consecutive calendar years at the top. Federer was ranked No. 1 for a record 237 consecutive weeks beginning in February 2004.

Federer is one of the founders, via his management company TEAM8, of the [[Laver Cup]]; the annual team tennis tournament which pits Europe against the rest of the world. He co-founded the tournament in honor of tennis legend [[Rod Laver]] and the inaugural edition was played in 2017.

In 2018, Federer returned to the Australian Open to defend his 2017 title and won his 20th Grand Slam tournament. This win placed him a total of four major titles ahead of long-time rival Rafael Nadal, who has won 16 Grand Slam tournaments.

==Cultural impact==
Federer helped to lead a revival in tennis known by many as the [[Big Four (tennis)|Golden Age]]. This led to increased interest in the sport, which in turn led to higher revenues for many venues across tennis. During this period rising revenues led to exploding prize money; when Federer first won the [[Australian Open]] in 2004 he earned $985,000, compared to when he won in 2018 and the prize had increased to AUD 4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/roger-federer/f324/overview|title=Roger Federer  Player Activity  ATP World Tour  Tennis|website=ATP World Tour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon winning the [[2009 French Open]] and completing the career Grand Slam, Federer became the first individual male tennis player to grace the cover of [[Sports Illustrated]] since [[Andre Agassi]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/c4/5d/49/c45d49278a524d6a107a00c354bb05c0.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the first non-American player to appear on the cover of the magazine since [[Stefan Edberg]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="sicovers.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sicovers.com/SearchResults.aspx?pc=Tennis|title=Search Results|website=sicovers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer again made the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'' following his record breaking [[2017 Wimbledon Championships  Men's Singles|8th Wimbledon title]] and second Grand Slam of 2017, becoming the first male tennis player to be featured on the cover since himself in 2009.&lt;ref name="sicovers.com"/&gt;

==Playing style==
Federer's versatility has been described by [[Jimmy Connors]] as: "In an era of specialists, you're either a clay court specialist, a grass court specialist, or a hard court specialist... or you're Roger Federer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsfeelgoodstories.com/2009/02/20/roger-federer-a-class-act-on-and-off-the-court-leads-tennis-revival/|title=Roger Federer, a class act on and off the court, leads tennis revival|author=sportsfeelgoodstories.com|date=20 February 2009|accessdate=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Federer Technique - Oz Open 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Federer serving]]
An elite athlete, Federer is an [[Tennis strategy#All-court player|all-court, all-around player]] known for his speed, fluid style of play, and exceptional shot making. Federer mainly plays from the baseline but is also comfortable at the net, being one of the best volleyers in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/696033/sizzling-on-court-humble-off-court/|title=Hall of Fame: Roger Federer  the Swiss Maestro|author= Aamna Saiyid|publisher=International New york times|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a powerful, accurate [[smash (tennis)|smash]] and very effectively performs rare elements playing tennis, such as backhand smash and [[skyhook (tennis)|skyhook]], half-volley, jump smash (slam dunk) and SABR (Sneak Attack By Roger, a half-volley attack on an opponent's second serve). [[David Foster Wallace]] compared the brute force of Federer's forehand motion with that of "a great liquid whip",&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html|author=David Foster Wallace|title=Federer as Religious Experience|date=20 August 2006|work=The New York Times|accessdate=21 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[John McEnroe]] has referred to Federer's forehand as "the greatest shot in our sport."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/roger-or-rafa-clash-of-the-wimbledon-sex-symbols-860499.html|title=Roger or Rafa: Clash of the Wimbledon sex symbols|work=The Independent|date=5 July 2008|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer is also known for his efficient movement around the court and excellent footwork, which enables him to run around shots directed to his backhand and instead hit a powerful inside-out or inside-in forehand, one of his best shots.

Federer plays with a single-handed backhand, which gives him great variety. He employs the [[Backspin|slice]], occasionally using it to lure his opponent to the net and deliver a passing shot. Federer can also fire [[topspin]] winners and possesses a 'flick' backhand with which he can generate pace with his wrist; this is usually used to pass the opponent at the net.&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt; His [[serve (tennis)|serve]] is difficult to read because he always uses a similar ball toss, regardless of what type of serve he is going to hit and where he aims to hit it, and turns his back to his opponents during his motion. He is often able to produce big serves on key points during a match. His first serve is typically around 200&amp;nbsp;km/h (125&amp;nbsp;mph);&lt;ref name=AUSServe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/scores/stats/day19/1701ms.html |title=Match Statistics: Federer vs. Murray |author=Australianopen.com |accessdate=16 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225093113/http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/scores/stats/day19/1701ms.html |archivedate=25 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WIMBYServe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/scores/stats/day21/1701ms.html|title=Match Statistics:Federer vs. Roddick|author=Wimbledon.org|accessdate=16 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612031302/http://2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/scores/stats/day21/1701ms.html|archivedate=12 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon08/columns/story?columnist=ubha_ravi&amp;id=3471097|title=Federer's serve allowing him to manufacture easy points|author=Ubha, Ravi|publisher=ESPN|date=2 July 2008|accessdate=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, he is capable of serving at 220&amp;nbsp;km/h (137&amp;nbsp;mph).&lt;ref name=AUSServe/&gt;&lt;ref name=WIMBYServe/&gt; Federer is also accomplished at [[serve and volley]]ing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/jul/08/tennis.wimbledon2003|author=Stephen Bierley|title=Serve-volley dead?

Later in his career, Federer added the drop shot to his arsenal and can perform a well-disguised one off both wings. He sometimes uses a between-the-legs shot, which is colloquially referred to as a "[[Tweener (tennis)|tweener]]" or "hotdog". His most notable use of the tweener was in the semifinals of the [[2009 US Open (tennis)|2009 US Open]] against [[Novak Djokovic]], bringing him triple match point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/264126-the-tail-of-two-tweeners-federer-vs-llodra|title=The Tale of Two Tweeners: Federer vs. Llodra|author=Nima Naderi|publisher=bleacherreport.com|date=30 September 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207163358/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/264126-the-tail-of-two-tweeners-federer-vs-llodra|archivedate=7 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federer is one of the top players who employ successfully the "squash shot", when he gets pushed deep and wide on his forehand wing. Since [[Stefan Edberg]] joined his coaching team at the start of the 2014 season, Federer has played a more offensive game, attacking the net more often, and improved his volley shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Steve Tignor|title=No. 8: The Roger Resurgence|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2014/12/roger-resurgence/53370/|publisher=Tennis.com|date=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Peter Bodo|title=The Reliables|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2014/08/reliables/52464|publisher=Tennis.com|date=17 August 2014|authorlink1=Peter Bodo}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lead-up to the 2015 US Open, Federer successfully added a new unique shot to his arsenal called SABR (Sneak Attack by Roger), in which he charges forward to receive the second serve and hits a return on the service line. The SABR is a unique shot that Federer owns, in the way that he manages to add enough power and placement into the shot, which makes it very difficult, or close to impossible for the opponent to reach it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2015-09-03/the_sabr_federers_new_bravado.html?chip=2|title=The SABR: Federer's new bravado|website=USOpen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With the switch to a bigger 97 inch racket from 90 inches, Federer has gained easy power while relinquishing some control on his shots. The bigger racket has enabled easier serving and better defense on both wings with fewer shanks. However this has diminished his forehand, slice backhand and dropshot.{{citation needed|reason=|date=April 2017}} Since his comeback in 2017, Federer is noted for his improved backhand both down the line and cross court which was cited as the reason for his win against Nadal in the 2017 Australian Open Final and Indian Wells 4th round.

Federer is also noted for his cool demeanour and emotional control on the court. In contrast to his early career, most of his professional game has been characterised by lack of outbursts or emotional frustration at errors, which gives him an advantage over less controlled opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/addiction-in-society/201509/why-roger-federer-is-great|title=Why Roger Federer is Great|author=Stanton Peele|publisher=psychologytoday.com|date=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/sports/tennis/10federer.html|title=Cool Federer Image Was Forged in a Hot Head|author=David Waldstein|work=The New York Times|date=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federer declared:
{{bquote|I don't get the anxiety during a match so much anymore. You know, to throw racquets, to toss balls out of the court, scream and stuff. I almost laugh [on the inside] about it a little bit today when an opponent does it.
