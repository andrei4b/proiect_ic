'''Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KBE}} (13 August 1899  29 April 1980) was an English&lt;!--as per [[MOS:BIO]]; In addition to notability, self identification; "I'm English": Hitchcock in a 1963 interview with Fallaci; see http://scrapsfromtheloft.com/2016/06/14/fallaci-hitchcock-interview/--&gt; [[film director]] and [[film producer|producer]], widely regarded as one of the most influential filmmakers in the history of cinema. Known as "the Master of Suspense", he directed 53 [[feature film]]s{{efn|According to Gene Adair (2002), Hitchcock made 53 feature films.{{sfn|Adair|2002|p=9}} According to [[Roger Ebert]] in 1980, it was 54.&lt;ref name=Ebert1May1980&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|author-link=Roger Ebert|title=The Master of Suspense is Dead|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/the-master-of-suspense-is-dead|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=1 May 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} in a career spanning six decades, becoming as well-known as any of his actors thanks to his many interviews, his [[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|cameo roles]] in most of his films, and his hosting of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' (19551965).

Born on the outskirts of London, Hitchcock entered the film industry in 1919 as a [[Intertitle|title card]] designer after training as a technical clerk and copy writer for a telegraph-cable company. His first successful film, ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog]]'' (1927), helped to shape the thriller genre, while his 1929 film, ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'', was the first British "[[Sound film#Transition: Europe|talkie]]".&lt;ref name=Blackmail/&gt; Two of his 1930's thrillers, ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935) and ''[[The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938), are ranked among the [[BFI Top 100 British films|greatest British films]] of the 20th century. By 1939 Hitchcock was a filmmaker of international importance, and film producer [[David O. Selznick]] persuaded him to move to Hollywood. A string of successful films followed, including ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' (1940),  ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), and ''[[The Paradine Case]]'' (1947); ''Rebecca'' was nominated for 11 Oscars and won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture#1940s|Academy Award for Best Picture]].&lt;ref name=Rebecca/&gt;

The "[[Hitchcockian]]" style includes the use of camera movement to mimic a person's gaze, thereby turning viewers into [[voyeurism|voyeurs]], and framing [[Shot (filmmaking)|shot]]s to maximise anxiety and fear. The film critic [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] wrote that the meaning of a Hitchcock film "is there in the method, in the progression from shot to shot. A Hitchcock film is an organism, with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole."{{sfn|Wood|2002|p=62}} By 1960 Hitchcock had directed four films [[List of films considered the best|often ranked]] among the greatest of all time: ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958), ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), and ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960); in 2012 ''Vertigo'' replaced [[Orson Welles]]'s ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) as the [[British Film Institute]]'s best film ever made.&lt;ref name=Christie2012/&gt; By 2016 seven of his films had been selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]],{{efn|The films selected for the [[National Film Registry]] are ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958), ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), and ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963).&lt;ref name=loc&gt;{{cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=31 December 2017}}{{pb}}

You never saw it? Ah. It was written by [[Thornton Wilder]]. It's a character study, a suspense thriller. The beauty of the film was it was shot in the actual town."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morehouse|first1=Rebecca|title=Alfred Hitchcock Not a Male Chauvinist|work=Lima News|agency=[[North American Newspaper Alliance]]|date=16 July 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He received the [[AFI Life Achievement Award]] in 1979 and was [[KBE|knighted]] in December that year, four months before he died.&lt;ref name=Todd30April1980/&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life: 18991919===
====Early childhood and education====
&lt;!--look for images of St Ignatius and Henley's--&gt;
[[File:William Hitchcock with boy and pony, c. 1900.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|William Hitchcock, probably with his first son, William, outside the family shop in London, c. 1900; the sign above the store says "W. Hitchcock". The Hitchcocks used the pony to deliver groceries.]]
Hitchcock was born in the flat above his parents' leased grocer's shop at 517 High Road, [[Leytonstone]], on the outskirts of [[east London]] (then part of [[Essex]]), the youngest of three children: William (born 1890), Ellen Kathleen ("Nellie") (1892), and Alfred Joseph (1899). His parents, Emma Jane Hitchcock, ne Whelan (18631942), and William Hitchcock (18621914), were both [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]s, with partial roots in Ireland;{{sfn|Adair|2002|pp=1112}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishecho.com/2011/02/st-patricks-day-2005-the-master-of-suspense-2/|title=St. Patrick's Day 2005: The Master of Suspense - Archive |work= Irish Echo|date=17 February 2011|publisher=|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; William was a [[greengrocer]] as his father had been.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1996|pp=2122}}; {{harvnb|Spoto|1999|pp=1415}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a large extended family, including Uncle John Hitchcock with his five-bedroom Victorian house on Campion Road, [[Putney]], complete with maid, cook, chauffeur and gardener. Every summer John rented a seaside house for the family in [[Cliftonville]], Kent. Hitchcock said that he first became class-conscious there, noticing the differences between tourists and locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing himself as a well-behaved boyhis father called him his "little lamb without a spot"Hitchcock said he could not remember ever having had a playmate.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=25}} One of his favourite stories for interviewers was about his father sending him to the local police station with a note when he was five; the policeman looked at the note and locked him in a cell for a few minutes, saying, "This is what we do to naughty boys." The experience left him, he said, with a lifelong fear of policemen; in 1973 he told [[Tom Snyder]] that he was "scared stiff of anything&amp;nbsp;... to do with the law" and wouldn't even drive a car in case he got a parking ticket.&lt;ref&gt;For the police story: {{harvnb|Truffaut|1983|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Taylor|1996|p=25}}; [[Dick Cavett|Cavett, Dick]] (8 June 1972). "Interview with Alfred Hitchcock", ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'', ABC, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYTx6N24tHk&amp;t=6m52s 00:06:52].{{pb}}

When he was six, the family moved to [[Limehouse]] and leased two stores at 130 and 175 Salmon Lane, which they ran as a [[fish and chips|fish-and-chips]] shop and fishmongers' respectively; they lived above the former.&lt;ref name=McG2003p13&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that Hitchcock was seven when he attended his first school, the Howrah House Convent in [[Poplar, London|Poplar]], which he entered in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spoto|1999|pp=20, 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], he stayed at Howrah House for at most two years. He also attended a convent school, the Wode Street School "for the daughters of gentlemen and little boys", run by the [[Faithful Companions of Jesus]]; briefly attended a primary school near his home; and was for a very short time, when he was nine, a boarder at [[Salesian College, Battersea|Salesian College]] in [[Battersea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1996|p=29}}; {{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family moved again when he was 11, this time to [[Stepney]], and on 5 October 1910 Hitchcock was sent to [[St Ignatius' College|St Ignatius College]] in [[Stamford Hill]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[grammar school]] with a reputation for discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Truffaut|1983|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Spoto|1999|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The priests used a hard rubber cane on the boys, always at the end of the day, so the boys had to sit through classes anticipating the punishment once they knew they'd been written up for it. He said it was here that he developed his sense of fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Truffaut|1983|p=26}}; {{harvnb|Fallaci|1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school register lists his year of birth as 1900 rather than 1899; Spoto writes that it seems he was deliberately enrolled as a 10-year-old, perhaps because he was a year behind with his schooling.{{sfn|Spoto|1999|pp=2324}} Hitchcock said he was "usually among the four or five at the top of the class";{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=26}} at the end of his first year, his work in Latin, English, French and religious education was noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adair|2002|p=15}}; {{harvnb|Truffaut|1983|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; His favourite subject was geography, and he became interested in maps, and railway and bus timetables; according to Taylor, he could recite all the stops on the [[Orient Express]].{{sfn|Taylor|1996|p=31}} He told [[Peter Bogdanovich]]: "The Jesuits taught me organization, control and, to some degree, analysis."{{sfn|Adair|2002|p=15}}&lt;!--replace source--&gt;

====Henley's====
Hitchcock told his parents that he wanted to be an engineer,{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=26}} and on 25 July 1913,&lt;ref name=Spoto1999p23&gt;{{harvnb|Spoto|1999|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; he left St Ignatius and enrolled in night classes at the London County Council School of Engineering and Navigation in Poplar. In a [[Hitchcock/Truffaut|book-length interview]] in 1962, he told [[Franois Truffaut]] that he had studied "mechanics, electricity, acoustics, and navigation".{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=26}} Then on 12 December 1914 his father, who had been suffering from emphysema and kidney disease, died at the age of 52.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; To support himself and his motherhis older siblings had left home by thenHitchcock took a job, for 15 [[Shilling (British coin)|shillings]] a week ({{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|0.75|1914}}}} in 2017),{{inflation-fn|UK}} as a technical clerk at the [[William Thomas Henley|Henley Telegraph and Cable Company]] in Blomfield Street near [[London Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adair|2002|p=15}}; {{harvnb|Spoto|1999|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept up his night classes, this time in art history, painting, economics, and political science.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spoto|1999|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; His older brother ran the family shops, while he and his mother continued to live in Salmon Lane.{{sfn|Ackroyd|2015|p=11}}

He was too young to enlist when [[World War I]] broke out in July 1914, and when he was old enough, in 1917, he was classified as "C3" ("free from serious organic disease, able to stand service conditions in garrisons at home&amp;nbsp;... only suitable for sedentary work").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1996|pp=2728}};&lt;!--check page--&gt; [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1918/jun/20/military-service-medical-grading "Military service (medical grading")], ''Hansard'', vol. 107, 20 June 1918, 607642.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined a volunteer corps of the [[Royal Engineers]] and took part in theoretical briefings; there was one session of practical exercises in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], during which, [[John Russell Taylor]] wrote, his [[puttees]] kept falling down around his ankles.{{sfn|Taylor|1996|p=28}}

After the war, Hitchcock began dabbling in creative writing. In June 1919 he became a founding editor and business manager of Henley's in-house publication, ''The Henley Telegraph'' (sixpence a copy), to which he submitted several short stories.{{sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=30}}{{efn|In his first story, "Gas" (June 1919), published in the first issue, a young woman is being assaulted by a mob of men in Paris, only to find she has been hallucinating in the dentist's chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duncan|2003|p=20}}; Hitchcock, Alfred (June 1919).

He apparently loved the job and would stay late at the office to examine the proofs; he told Truffaut that this was his "first step toward cinema".{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=26}}{{sfn|Taylor|1996|p=21}} He enjoyed watching films, especially American cinema, and from the age of 16 read the trade papers; he watched [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[D. W. Griffith]] and [[Buster Keaton]], and particularly liked [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Destiny (1921 film)|Der mde Tod]]'' (1921).{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=26}}

While still at Henley's, he read in a trade paper that [[Famous Players-Lasky]], the production arm of [[Paramount Pictures]], was opening a studio in London.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=27}} They were planning to film ''[[The Sorrows of Satan]]'' by [[Marie Corelli]], so he produced some drawings for the [[Intertitle|title cards]] and sent his work to the studio.{{sfn|Taylor|1996}}{{page needed|date=December 2017}} They hired him, and in 1919 he began working for [[Islington Studios]] in Poole Street, [[Hoxton]], as a title-card designer.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=27}} [[Donald Spoto]] writes that most of the staff were Americans with strict job specifications, but the English workers were encouraged to try their hand at anything, which meant that Hitchcock gained experience as a co-writer, art director and production manager on at least 18 silent films.{{sfn|Spoto|2008|p=3}} ''The Times'' wrote in February 1922 about the studio's "special art title department under the supervision of Mr. A.

When Paramount pulled out of London in 1922, Hitchcock was hired as an assistant director by a new firm run in the same location by [[Michael Balcon]], later known as [[Gainsborough Pictures]].{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=27}}{{sfn|Spoto|2008|pp=34}} Hitchcock worked on ''[[Woman to Woman (1923 film)|Woman to Woman]]'' (1923) with the director [[Graham Cutts]], designing the set, writing the script and producing. He said: "It was the first film that I had really got my hands onto."{{sfn|Spoto|2008|pp=34}} The editor and "script girl" on ''Woman to Woman'' was [[Alma Reville]], his future wife. He also worked as an assistant to Cutts on ''[[The White Shadow (film)|The White Shadow]]'' (1924), ''[[The Passionate Adventure]]'' (1924), ''[[The Blackguard]]'' (1925), and ''[[The Prude's Fall]]'' (1925).{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=30}} ''The Blackguard'' was produced at the [[Babelsberg Studios]] in Potsdam, where Hitchcock watched part of the making of [[F. W. Murnau]]'s film ''[[The Last Laugh (1924 film)|The Last Laugh]]'' (1924).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gottlieb|2002|p=42}}; {{harvnb|Gottlieb|2003|pp=157158}}; also see {{harvnb|Garncarz|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was impressed with Murnau's work and later used many of his techniques for the set design in his own productions.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2002|pp=4243}}&lt;!--check this and rewrite: He would also have been affected by other foreign filmmakers whose work he absorbed as one of the earliest members of the London Film Society, formed in 1925.&lt;ref name=Kehr /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Henry K.|last=Miller|title=Film Society, The (192539)|publisher= BFI Screenonline|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/454755/index.html |accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

&lt;!--say more about this and rearrange--&gt;In the summer of 1925, Balcon asked Hitchcock to direct ''[[The Pleasure Garden (film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'' (1925), starring [[Virginia Valli]], a co-production of Gainsborough and the German firm [[Emelka]] at the Geiselgasteig studio near Munich. Reville, by then Hitchcock's fiance, was assistant director-editor.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|pp=31, 36}}{{sfn|Spoto|1992|p=3}}&lt;!--explain about woman and water; Truffaut p. 34--&gt; Although the film was a commercial flop,{{sfn|McGilligan|2003|pp=6871}} Balcon liked Hitchcock's work; a ''Daily Express'' headline called him, "Young man with a master mind".{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=39}} Balcon asked him to direct a second film in Munich, ''[[The Mountain Eagle]]'' (1926), released in the United States as ''Fear o' God''. The film is lost; Hitchcock called it "a very bad movie".{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=39}}{{sfn|Spoto|1992|p=5}} 

&lt;!--explain that opinion was divided; see McGilligan, p. 83.--&gt;&lt;!--mention The Ring, his first original screenplay, British International Pictures--&gt;Hitchcock's luck changed with his first thriller, ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog]]'' (1927), about the hunt for a serial killer who, wearing a black cloak and carrying a black bag, is murdering young blonde women in London, and only on Tuesdays.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=45}} A landlady suspects that her lodger is the killer, but he turns out to be innocent. To convey that footsteps were being heard from an upper floor, Hitchcock had a glass floor made so that the audience could see the lodger pacing up and down in his room above the landlady.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=47}} Hitchcock had wanted the leading man to be guilty, or for the film at least to end ambiguously, but the star was [[Ivor Novello]], a [[matine idol]], and the "[[star system (filmmaking)|star system]]" meant that Novello could not be the villain. Hitchcock told Truffaut: "You have to clearly spell it out in big letters: 'He is innocent.'" (He had the same problem years later with [[Cary Grant]] in ''[[#Suspicion|Suspicion]]'' (1941).){{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=43}} Released in January 1927, ''The Lodger'' was a commercial and critical success in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kapsis|1992|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock told Truffaut that the film was the first of his to be influenced by the [[German Expressionism|Expressionist]] techniques he had witnessed in Germany: "In truth, you might almost say that ''The Lodger'' was my first picture."{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=44}}&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004 edition; is the date correct? --&gt; He made his first cameo appearances in the film, purely because an extra body was needed, sitting in a newsroom and later standing in a crowd as the leading man is arrested.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=49}}

It also established the quintessential English "Hitchcock blonde" ([[Madeleine Carroll]]) as the template for his succession of ice-cold, elegant leading ladies.

Hitchcock released two spy thrillers in 1936. ''[[Sabotage (1936 film)|Sabotage]]'' was loosely based on [[Joseph Conrad]]'s novel, ''[[The Secret Agent]]'' (1907), about a woman who discovers that her husband is a terrorist, and ''[[Secret Agent (1936 film)|Secret Agent]]'', based on two stories in ''[[Ashenden: Or the British Agent]]'' (1928) by [[W.

&lt;!--Mention Young and Innocent (1937); first meeting with Selznick--&gt;Hitchcock's next major success was ''[[The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938), "one of the greatest train movies from the genre's golden era", according to [[Philip French]], in which Miss Froy ([[May Whitty]]), a British spy posing as a governess, disappears on a train journey through the fictional European country of Bandrika.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Philip|last=French|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jul/24/my-favourite-hitchcock-lady-vanishes |title=My favourite Hitchcock: The Lady Vanishes|newspaper=The Guardian|date=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film saw Hitchcock receive the 1939&amp;nbsp;[[New York Film Critics Circle Award]] for Best Director, the only time he won an award for his direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lady Vanishes |work=Turner Classic Movies |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/80706/The-Lady-Vanishes/ |accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2018}} Benjamin Crisler, the ''New York Times'' film critic, wrote in June 1938: "Three unique and valuable institutions the British have that we in America have not: [[Magna Charta]], the [[Tower Bridge]] and Alfred Hitchcock, the greatest director of screen melodramas in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crisler|first1=B.

===Early Hollywood years: 19391945===
====Selznick contract====
&lt;!--check that it was March, and say more about sources of tension with Selznick that led him to lend Hitchcock to other studios--&gt;[[David O. Selznick]] signed Hitchcock to a seven-year contract beginning in March 1939, and the Hitchcocks moved to Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leff|1999|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In June that year ''Life'' magazine called him the "greatest master of melodrama in screen history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|date= 19 June 1939|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=b0kEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66 66] |title=Alfred Hitchcock: England's Best Director starts work in Hollywood}}&lt;/ref&gt; The working arrangements with Selznick were less than ideal. Selznick suffered from constant financial problems, and Hitchcock was often unhappy about Selznick's creative control over his films. In a later interview, Hitchcock said: "[Selznick] was the Big Producer.&amp;nbsp;... Producer was king. The most flattering thing Mr. Selznick ever said about meand it shows you the amount of controlhe said I was the 'only director' he'd 'trust with a film'."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gottlieb|2003|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Selznick complained about Hitchcock's "goddamn jigsaw cutting", which meant that the producer had to follow Hitchcock's vision of the finished product.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|pp= 251252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selznick lent Hitchcock to the larger studios more often than producing Hitchcock's films himself. Selznick made only a few films each year, as did fellow independent producer [[Samuel Goldwyn]], so he did not always have projects for Hitchcock to direct. Goldwyn had also negotiated with Hitchcock on a possible contract, only to be outbid by Selznick. Hitchcock was quickly impressed by the superior resources of the American studios compared to the financial limits he had often faced in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leff|1999|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rebecca (1940) - Trailer.webm|thumb|Trailer for ''Rebecca'' (1940)]]

The Selznick picture ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940) was Hitchcock's first American film, set in a Hollywood version of England's Cornwall and based on a novel by English novelist [[Daphne du Maurier]]. The film stars [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Joan Fontaine]]. The story concerns a nave (and unnamed) young woman who marries a widowed aristocrat. She goes to live in his huge [[English country house]], and struggles with the lingering reputation of his elegant and worldly first wife Rebecca, who died under mysterious circumstances. The film won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] at the [[13th Academy Awards]]; the statuette was given to Selznick, as the film's producer. Hitchcock was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], his first of five such nominations.&lt;ref name=Rebecca&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1941 |title=The 13th Academy Awards, 1941|accessdate=30 December 2017|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duncan|2003|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock's second American film was the thriller ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' (1940), set in Europe, based on [[Vincent Sheean]]'s book ''Personal History'' (1935) and produced by [[Walter Wanger]]. It was nominated for Best Picture that year. Hitchcock felt uneasy living and working in Hollywood while his country was at war; his concern resulted in a film that overtly supported the British war effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duncan|2003|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filmed in the first year of [[World War II]], it was inspired by the rapidly changing events in Europe, as covered by an American newspaper reporter played by [[Joel McCrea]]. Mixing footage of European scenes with scenes filmed on a Hollywood backlot, the film avoided direct references to [[Nazism]], [[Nazi Germany]], and [[German people|Germans]] to comply with Hollywood's [[Motion Picture Production Code]] censorship at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2017}}

In September 1940 the Hitchcocks bought the {{convert|200|acre|km2|sing=on}} Cornwall Ranch near [[Scotts Valley]], California, in the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Their primary residence was an English-style home in Bel Air, purchased in 1942.&lt;ref name="Variety obituary"/&gt; Hitchcock's films were diverse during this period, ranging from the romantic comedy ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (1941 film)|Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith]]'' (1941) to the bleak [[film noir]] ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943).

[[File:Cary Grant Joan Fontaine Suspicion.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Cary Grant]] and [[Joan Fontaine]] in a publicity shot for ''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]'' (1941)]]
{{anchor|Suspicion}}''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]'' (1941) marked Hitchcock's first film as a producer and director. It is set in England; Hitchcock used the north coast of [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] for the English coastline sequence. The film is the first of four projects on which [[Cary Grant]] worked with Hitchcock, and it is one of the rare occasions that Grant was cast in a sinister role. Grant plays Johnnie Aysgarth, an English  [[Confidence trick|con man]] whose actions raise suspicion and anxiety in his shy young English wife, Lina McLaidlaw ([[Joan Fontaine]]).{{sfn|Whitty|2016|pp=434435}} In one scene Hitchcock placed a light inside a glass of milk, perhaps poisoned, that Grant is bringing to his wife; the light makes sure that the audience's attention is on the glass. Grant's character is a killer in the book on which the film was based, ''[[Before the Fact]]'' by [[Francis Iles]], but the studio felt that Grant's image would be tarnished by that. Hitchcock therefore settled for an ambiguous finale, although, as he told Franois Truffaut, he would have preferred to end with the wife's murder.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|pp=142143}}{{efn|Hitchcock told [[Bryan Forbes]] in 1967: "They had gone through the film in my absence and taken out every scene that indicated the possibility that Cary Grant was a murderer. So there was no film existing at all. That was ridiculous. Nevertheless, I had to compromise on the end. What I wanted to do was that the wife was aware that she was going to be murdered by her husband, so she wrote a letter to her mother saying that she was very much in love with him, she didn't want live anymore, she was going to be killed but society should be protected. She therefore brings up this fatal glass of milk, drinks it and before she does she says, "Will you mail this letter to mother?" Then she drinks the milk and dies. You then have just one final scene of a cheerful Cary Grant going to the mailbox and posting the letter.&amp;nbsp;... But this was never permitted because of the basic error in casting."&lt;ref name=HitchcockForbes/&gt;}} Fontaine won [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for her performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luther|first1=Claudia|title=Joan Fontaine, actress who won Oscar for 'Suspicion,' dies at 96|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/dec/15/entertainment/la-et-mn-joan-fontaine-actress-who-won-oscar-for-suspicion-dies-at-96-20131215|work=Los Angeles Times|date=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--added something about mother's death (26 September 1942) and brother's (4 January 1943)--&gt;''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]'' (1942) is the first of two films that Hitchcock made for [[Universal Studios|Universal]] during the decade. Hitchcock was forced by Universal Studios to use Universal contract player [[Robert Cummings]] and [[Priscilla Lane]], a freelancer who signed a one-picture deal with Universal, both known for their work in comedies and light dramas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Humphries|1994|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breaking with Hollywood conventions of the time, Hitchcock did extensive location filming, especially in New York City, and depicted a confrontation between a suspected saboteur (Cummings) and a real saboteur ([[Norman Lloyd (actor)|Norman Lloyd]]) atop the [[Statue of Liberty]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} He also directed ''Have You Heard?''

&lt;!--why was it his favourite?--&gt;''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943) was Hitchcock's personal favourite and the second of the early Universal films. Charlotte "Charlie" Newton ([[Teresa Wright]]) suspects her beloved uncle Charlie Oakley ([[Joseph Cotten]]) of being a serial killer. Hitchcock again filmed extensively on location, this time in the Northern California city of [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leitch|first1=Thomas|title=Shadow of a Doubt|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/static/national-film-preservation-board/documents/shadow_of_doubt.pdf|accessdate=31 December 2017|publisher=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working at [[20th Century Fox]], Hitchcock adapted a script of [[John Steinbeck]]'s, which recorded the experiences of the survivors of a German U-boat attack in the film ''[[Lifeboat (film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944). The action sequences were shot in a small boat in the studio water tank. The locale posed problems for Hitchcock's traditional cameo appearance. That was solved by having Hitchcock's image appear in a newspaper that [[William Bendix]] is reading in the boat, showing the director in a before-and-after advertisement for "Reduco-Obesity Slayer".&lt;ref name=Spoto1999p267&gt;The film was ''[[Lifeboat (film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944).

Hitchcock's typical dinner before the weight loss had been a roast chicken, boiled ham, potatoes, bread, vegetables, relishes, salad, dessert, a bottle of wine and some brandy. To lose weight, he stopped drinking, drank black coffee for breakfast and lunch, and ate steak and salad for dinner, but it was hard to maintain; Spoto writes that his weight fluctuated considerably over the next 40 years. At the end of 1943, despite the weight loss, the Occidental Insurance Company of Los Angeles refused him life insurance.{{sfn|Spoto|1999|pp=266267}}

Hitchcock returned to the UK for an extended visit in late 1943 and early 1944. While there he made two short [[propaganda film]]s, ''[[Bon Voyage (1944 film)|Bon Voyage]]'' (1944) and ''[[Aventure Malgache]]'' (1944), for the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]]. In June and July 1945 Hitchcock served as "treatment advisor" on a [[Holocaust]] documentary that used Allied Forces footage of the liberation of [[Nazi concentration camps]]. The film was assembled in London and produced by [[Sidney Bernstein, Baron Bernstein|Sidney Bernstein]] of the Ministry of Information, who brought Hitchcock (a friend of his) on board. It was originally intended to be broadcast to the Germans, but the British government deemed it too traumatic to be shown to a shocked post-war population. Instead, it was transferred in 1952 from the [[British War Office]] film vaults to London's [[Imperial War Museum]] and remained unreleased until 1985, when an edited version was broadcast as an episode of [[PBS]] ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'', under the title the Imperial War Museum had given it: ''Memory of the Camps''. The full-length version of the film, ''[[German Concentration Camps Factual Survey]]'', was restored in 2014 by scholars at the Imperial War Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|pages=372374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jeffries9Jan2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jeffries|first1=Stuart|title=The Holocaust film that was too shocking to show|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/09/holocaust-film-too-shocking-to-show-night-will-fall-alfred-hitchcock|work=The Guardian|date=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memory of the Camps: Frequently Asked Questions|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/camp/faqs.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Later Selznick films====
[[File:Spellbound-1945.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gregory Peck]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]] in ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945)]]
Hitchcock worked for David Selznick again when he directed ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), which explores [[psychoanalysis]] and features a [[dream sequence]] designed by [[Salvador Dal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boyd |first=David |title=The Parted Eye: ''Spellbound'' and Psychoanalysis |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/6/spellbound.html |year=2000 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224214107/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/6/spellbound.html |archivedate=24 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dream sequence as it appears in the film is ten minutes shorter than was originally envisioned; Selznick edited it to make it "play" more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leff|1987|pp=164165}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gregory Peck]] plays amnesiac Dr. Anthony Edwardes under the treatment of analyst Dr. Peterson ([[Ingrid Bergman]]), who falls in love with him while trying to unlock his repressed past.{{sfn|Whitty|2016|pp=408412}} Two point-of-view shots were achieved by building a large wooden hand (which would appear to belong to the character whose point of view the camera took) and out-sized props for it to hold: a bucket-sized glass of milk and a large wooden gun. For added novelty and impact, the climactic gunshot was hand-coloured red on some copies of the black-and-white film. The original musical score by [[Mikls Rzsa]] makes use of the [[theremin]], and some of it was later adapted by the composer into Rozsa's Piano Concerto Op. 31 (1967) for piano and orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Miklos Rozsa Society Website |url=http://www.miklosrozsa.info/mrs/works/aboutPianoConcerto.html |year=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2017}}

&lt;!--mention ''The Paradine Case'' (1947) and the Motion Picture Production Code--&gt;''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946) followed ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]''.
Hitchcock told Franois Truffaut that Selznick had sold him, Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant, and the screenplay by [[Ben Hecht]], to RKO Radio Pictures as a "package" for $500,000 ({{Inflation|US|500,000|1946|fmt=eq}}) because of cost overruns on Selznick's ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} ''Notorious'' stars Bergman and Grant, both Hitchcock regulars, and features a plot about Nazis, [[uranium]] and South America. His prescient use of uranium as a plot device led to him being briefly placed under surveillance by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} According to McGilligan, in or around March 1945 Hitchcock and [[Ben Hecht]] consulted [[Robert Millikan]] of the [[California Institute of Technology]] about the development of a uranium bomb. Selznick complained that the notion was "science fiction", only to be confronted by the news of the detonation of two atomic bombs on [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in Japan in August 1945.{{sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=370371}}

====Transatlantic Pictures====
[[File:Ropetrailer2.jpg|thumb|A typical shot from ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948) with [[James Stewart]] turning his back to the fixed camera|alt=A typical scene from ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' showing [[James Stewart]]]]

Hitchcock formed an independent production company, [[Transatlantic Pictures]], with his friend [[Sidney Bernstein, Baron Bernstein|Sidney Bernstein]]. He made two films with Transatlantic, one of which was his first colour film. With ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948), Hitchcock experimented with marshalling suspense in a confined environment, as he had done earlier with ''[[Lifeboat (film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944). The film appears to have been shot in a single take, but it was actually shot in 10 takes ranging from 4- to 10 minutes each; a 10-minute length of film was the most that a camera's film magazine could hold at the time. Some transitions between reels were hidden by having a dark object fill the entire screen for a moment. Hitchcock used those points to hide the cut, and began the next take with the camera in the same place. The film features [[James Stewart]] in the leading role, and was the first of four films that Stewart made with Hitchcock. It was inspired by the [[Leopold and Loeb]] case of the 1920s.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The film was not well received.{{sfn|Evans|2017}}

''[[Under Capricorn]]'' (1949), set in 19th-century Australia, also uses the short-lived technique of long takes, but to a more limited extent. He again used Technicolor in this production, then returned to black-and-white films for several years. Transatlantic Pictures became inactive after these two unsuccessful films.&lt;ref name="Leigh 1995"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name="Stephen Rebello 1990"&gt;{{harvnb|Rebello|1990|loc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2017}} Hitchcock filmed ''[[Stage Fright (1950 film)|Stage Fright]]'' (1950) at studios in [[Elstree Studios|Elstree]], England, where he had worked during his British International Pictures contract many years before.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Warren|2001|pp=62, 72}}&lt;/ref&gt; He matched one of [[Warner Bros.]]' most popular stars, [[Jane Wyman]], with the expatriate German actor [[Marlene Dietrich]] and used several prominent British actors, including [[Michael Wilding (actor)|Michael Wilding]], [[Richard Todd]] and [[Alastair Sim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|Lasky|2002|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was Hitchcock's first proper production for Warner Bros., which had distributed ''Rope'' and ''Under Capricorn'', because Transatlantic Pictures was experiencing financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|pp= 429, 774775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Mention that, after falling out with Raymond Chandler, Hitchcock hired Czenzi Ormonde to work with Barbara Keon and Alma Reville; say more about the film, "crisscross", and murder in spectacles scene--&gt;His film ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951) was based on the novel of the [[Strangers on a Train (novel)|same name]] by [[Patricia Highsmith]]. Hitchcock combined many elements from his preceding films. He approached [[Dashiell Hammett]] to write the dialogue, but [[Raymond Chandler]] took over, then left over disagreements with the director. In the film, two men casually meet, one of whom speculates on a foolproof method to murder; he suggests that two people, each wishing to do away with someone, should each perform the other's murder. [[Farley Granger]]'s role was as the innocent victim of the scheme, while [[Robert Walker (actor, born 1918)|Robert Walker]], previously known for "boy-next-door" roles, played the villain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|pp=320, 322}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[I Confess (film)|I Confess]]'' (1953) was set in [[Quebec City|Quebec]] with [[Montgomery Clift]] as a Catholic priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/78777/I-Confess/notes.html | title=Notes: ''I Confess'' (1953)| author= | publisher=TCM | accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Dial M for Murder'' and ''Rear Window''====
[[File:Rearwindow trailer 2.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Still image from the film Read Window featuring Stewart and Kelly|[[James Stewart]] and [[Grace Kelly]] in ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954)]]
''I Confess'' was followed by three colour films starring [[Grace Kelly]]: ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' (1954), ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), and ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955). In ''Dial M for Murder'', [[Ray Milland]] plays the villain who tries to murder his unfaithful wife (Kelly) for her money. She kills the hired assassin in self-defence, so Milland manipulates the evidence to make it look like murder. Her lover, Mark Halliday ([[Robert Cummings]]), and Police Inspector Hubbard ([[John Williams (actor)|John Williams]]) save her from execution.&lt;ref name="Leitch 2002. p. 78-80"&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock experimented with [[3-D film|3D cinematography]] for ''Dial M''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=French|first1=Philip|title=Dial M for Murder 3D  review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/28/dial-m-for-murder-3d-review|work=The Observer|date=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--when did he move to Paramount?  Rear Window, To Catch a Thief, The Trouble with Harry (1955), The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960)--&gt;Hitchcock moved to [[Paramount Pictures]] and filmed ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), starring James Stewart and Kelly again, as well as [[Thelma Ritter]] and [[Raymond Burr]]. Stewart's character is a photographer (based on [[Robert Capa]]) who must temporarily use a wheelchair. Out of boredom, he begins observing his neighbours across the courtyard, then becomes convinced that one of them (Raymond Burr) has murdered his wife. Stewart eventually manages to convince his policeman buddy ([[Wendell Corey]]) and his girlfriend (Kelly). As with ''Lifeboat'' and ''Rope'', the principal characters are depicted in confined or cramped quarters, in this case Stewart's studio apartment. Hitchcock uses close-ups of Stewart's face to show his character's reactions, "from the comic voyeurism directed at his neighbours to his helpless terror watching Kelly and Burr in the villain's apartment".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His introductions always included some sort of wry humour, such as the description of a recent multi-person execution hampered by having only one [[electric chair]], while two are shown with a sign "Two chairsno waiting!". He directed 18 episodes of the series, which aired from 1955 to 1965. It became ''[[The Alfred Hitchcock Hour]]'' in 1962, and NBC broadcast the final episode on 10 May 1965. In the 1980s, a [[Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1985 TV series)|new version]] of ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' was produced for television, making use of Hitchcock's original introductions in a [[Film colorization|colourised]] form.&lt;ref name="Alfred Hitchcock Presents"/&gt;&lt;!--making this invisible for now; not sure where to place it: Hitchcock also appears as a character in the juvenile detective book series, ''[[Three Investigators|Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators]]''.

====From ''To Catch a Thief'' to ''Vertigo''====
[[File:Camo - La main au collet.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cameo appearance]] of Hitchcock next to Grant in his ''[[To Catch a Thief]]''|alt=Scene from ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' showing Hitchcock appearing next to [[Cary Grant]]]]

In 1955 Hitchcock became a United States citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p= 512}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, his third Grace Kelly film, ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'', was released; it is set in the French Riviera, and pairs Kelly with Cary Grant. Grant plays retired thief John Robie, who becomes the prime suspect for a spate of robberies in the Riviera. A thrill-seeking American heiress played by Kelly surmises his true identity and tries to seduce him. "Despite the obvious age disparity between Grant and Kelly and a lightweight plot, the witty script (loaded with double entendres) and the good-natured acting proved a commercial success."&lt;ref name="Leitch 2002. p. 366"&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|p=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Hitchcock's last film with Kelly. She married [[Prince Rainier]] of Monaco in 1956, and ended her film career. Hitchcock then remade his own [[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)|1934 film]] ''The Man Who Knew Too Much'' [[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|in 1956]]. This time, the film starred James Stewart and [[Doris Day]], who sang the theme song "[[Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)|Que Sera, Sera]]", which won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Oscar for Best Original Song]] and became a big hit for her. They play a couple whose son is kidnapped to prevent them from interfering with an assassination. As in the 1934 film, the climax takes place at the [[Royal Albert Hall]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1994|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--January 1957: hernia surgery; March 1957: gallbladder removed--&gt;''[[The Wrong Man]]'' (1957), Hitchcock's final film for Warner Bros., is a low-key black-and-white production based on a real-life case of mistaken identity reported in ''Life'' magazine in 1953. This was the only film of Hitchcock to star [[Henry Fonda]], playing a Stork Club musician mistaken for a liquor store thief, who is arrested and tried for robbery while his wife ([[Vera Miles]]) emotionally collapses under the strain. Hitchcock told Truffaut that his lifelong fear of the police attracted him to the subject and was embedded in many scenes.&lt;ref name="Leitch 2002. p. 377"&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|p=377}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--this needs sources and a rewrite: At the height of Hitchcock's success in 1956, he was asked to introduce a set of short-story collections with his name attached.

&lt;!--1957, [[Claude Chabrol]] and [[ric Rohmer]], first book-length study of his work--&gt;&lt;!--moved this from the "relationship with actors" section: In the late 1950s, [[French New Wave]] critics, especially Truffaut, [[Claude Chabrol]] and [[ric Rohmer]], were among the first to see and promote Hitchcock's films as artistic works. Hitchcock was one of the first directors to whom they applied their [[auteur theory]], which stresses the artistic authority of the director in the [[filmmaking]] process.&lt;ref name="Moerbeek2006"&gt;{{harvnb|Moerbeek|2006|loc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2017}}--&gt;[[File:Vertigo 1958 trailer Kim Novak at Golden Gate Bridge Fort Point.jpg|thumb|alt=Still image from the film Vertigo|[[Kim Novak]] by the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] in ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958).{{efn|A 2012 [[British Film Institute]] poll ranked ''Vertigo'' as the [[Sight &amp; Sound#2012|greatest film ever made]].&lt;ref name=Christie2012&gt;{{cite news|last=Christie|first=Ian|title=The 50 Greatest Films of All Time|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/50-greatest-films-all-time|work=Sight &amp; Sound|date=September 2012}}; also see {{cite news|title=Critics' top 100 |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/critics|publisher=British Film Institute|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}]]

Hitchcock's next film, ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958) again starred James Stewart, this time with [[Kim Novak]] and [[Barbara Bel Geddes]]. He had wanted [[Vera Miles]] to play the lead, but she was pregnant. He told [[Oriana Fallaci]]: "I was offering her a big part, the chance to become a beautiful sophisticated blonde, a real actress. Wed have spent a heap of dollars on it, and she has the bad taste to get pregnant. I hate pregnant women, because then they have children."{{sfn|Fallaci|1963}}

In the film, James Stewart plays Scottie, a former police investigator suffering from [[acrophobia]], who develops an obsession with a woman he has been hired to shadow (Kim Novak). Scottie's obsession leads to tragedy, and this time Hitchcock does not opt for a happy ending. Some critics, including [[Donald Spoto]] and [[Roger Ebert]], agree that ''Vertigo'' is the director's most personal and revealing film, dealing with the ''[[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]]''-like obsessions of a man who crafts a woman into the woman he desires. ''Vertigo'' explores more frankly and at greater length his interest in the relation between sex and death than any other work in his filmography.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kehr|2011|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--say something about the camera technique--&gt;''Vertigo'' contains a camera technique developed by Irmin Roberts, commonly referred to as a [[dolly zoom]], that has been copied many times by filmmakers.

====''North by Northwest'' and ''Psycho''====
{{see also|Psycho (franchise)}}
Hitchcock followed ''Vertigo'' with three more successful films, which are also recognised as among his best: ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960) and ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963). In ''North by Northwest'', Cary Grant portrays Roger Thornhill, a Madison Avenue advertising executive who is mistaken for a government secret agent. He is hotly pursued across the United States by enemy agents, including (it appears) Eve Kendall ([[Eva Marie Saint]]). Thornhill at first believes Kendall is helping him, then that she is an enemy agent; he eventually learns that she is working undercover for the CIA. During its opening two-week run at [[Radio City Music Hall]], the film grossed $404,056 ({{Inflation|US|404,056|1959|fmt=eq}}), setting a record in that theatre's non-holiday gross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,864921,00.html |title= Box Office: For the Books |date= 31 August 1959 |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called the film "smoothly troweled and thoroughly entertaining".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,937893,00.html |title= Cinema: The New Pictures |date= 17 August 1959 |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}{{pb}}

====Truffaut interview====
{{further|Hitchcock/Truffaut|Hitchcock/Truffaut (film)}}
&lt;!--expand--&gt;On 13 August 1962, Hitchcock's 63rd birthday, the French director [[Franois Truffaut]] began a 50-hour interview of Hitchcock, filmed over eight days at Universal Studios, during which Hitchcock agreed to answer 500 questions. It took four years to transcribe the tapes and organize the images; it was published as a book in 1967 (the "hitchbook", as Truffaut called it), and the footage was released as a documentary in 2015.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=12}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jeffries|first1=Stuart|title='Actors are cattle': when Hitchcock met Truffaut|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/12/when-hitchcock-met-truffaut-hitchcock-truffaut-documentary-cannes|work=The Guardian|date=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Truffaut sought the interview because it was clear to him that Hitchcock was not simply the entertainer the American media made him out to be. It was obvious from his films, Truffaut wrote, that Hitchcock had "given more thought to the potential of his art than any of his colleagues". He compared the interview to "Oedipus' consultation of the oracle".{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|pp=1112}}

The film scholar Peter William Evans writes that ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963) and ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964) are regarded as "undisputed masterpieces".{{sfn|Evans|2017}} Hitchcock had intended to film ''Marnie'' first, and in March 1962 it was announced that [[Grace Kelly]], Princess Grace of Monaco since 1956, would come out of retirement to star in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alden|first1=Robert|title=Princess Grace Will Star in Hitchcock Movie|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9406E6DE1239E43BBC4851DFB5668389679EDE&amp;legacy=true|work=The New York Times|date=20 March 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kelly asked Hitchcock to postpone ''Marnie'' until 1963 or 1964, he recruited [[Ed McBain|Evan Hunter]], author of ''The Blackboard Jungle'' (1954), to develop a screenplay based on a [[Daphne du Maurier]] short story, "[[The Birds (story)|The Birds]]" (1952), which Hitchcock had republished in his ''My Favorites in Suspense'' (1959). He hired [[Tippi Hedren]] to play the lead role.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|pp=611613}}; {{harvnb|MacDonald|2012|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was her first role; she had been a model in New York when Hitchcock saw her, in October 1961, in an NBC television ad for [[Sego (diet drink)|Sego]], a diet drink:{{sfn|Moral|2013|p=15}} "I signed her because she is a classic beauty. Movies don't have them any more. Grace Kelly was the last." He insisted, without explanation, that her first name be written in single quotation marks: 'Tippi'.{{efn|Thomas McDonald (''The New York Times'', 1 April 1962): "Starring in the film are Rod Taylor, Suzanne Pleshette, Jessica Tandy and 'Tippi' Hedren.

He insisted that she enclose her first name in single quotation marks, but would not explain why."&lt;ref name=McDonald1April1962&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDonald|first1=Thomas|title=Watching 'Birds': Happy Hitchcock Films Terror-Ridden Tale|url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/film/040162hitch-birds-making.html|work=The New York Times|date=1 April 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Spoto|2008|p=245}}}}

In ''The Birds'', Melanie Daniels, a young socialite, meets lawyer Mitch Brenner ([[Rod Taylor]]) in a bird shop; [[Jessica Tandy]] plays his possessive mother. Hedren visits him in [[Bodega Bay, California|Bodega Bay]] (where ''The Birds'' was filmed)&lt;ref name=McDonald1April1962/&gt; carrying a pair of [[lovebird]]s as a gift.

An [[HBO]]/[[BBC]] television film, ''[[The Girl (2012 TV film)|The Girl]]'' (2012), depicted Hedren's experiences on set; she said that Hitchcock [[#Tippi Hedren|became obsessed with her]] and sexually harassed her.

She broke down after a bird cut her lower eyelid, and filming was halted on doctor's orders.{{sfn|Spoto|1999|pp=457459}}

====''Marnie''====
[[File:Marnie (1964) trailer.webm|thumb|Trailer for ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964)]]

In June 1962, Grace Kelly announced that she had decided against appearing in ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964).&lt;!--explain why?--&gt; Hedren had signed an exclusive seven-year, $500-a-week contract with him in October 1961,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1996|p=270}};
{{harvnb|Moral|2013|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he decided to cast her in the lead role opposite [[Sean Connery]]. In 2016, describing Hedren's performance as "one of the greatest in the history of cinema", [[Richard Brody]] called the film a "story of sexual violence" inflicted on the character played by Hedren: "The film is, to put it simply, sick, and it's so because Hitchcock was sick. He suffered all his life from furious sexual desire, suffered from the lack of its gratification, suffered from the inability to transform fantasy into reality, and then went ahead and did so virtually, by way of his art."&lt;ref name=Brody17Aug2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brody|first1=Richard|author-link=Richard Brody|title="Marnie" Is the Cure for Hitchcock Mania|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/marnie-is-the-cure-for-hitchcock-mania|work=The New Yorker|date=17 August 2016}}{{pb}}

In the film, Marnie Edgar (Hedren) steals $10,000 ({{Inflation|US|10,000|1964|fmt=eq}}) from her employer and goes on the run. She applies for a job at Mark Rutland's (Connery) company in Philadelphia and steals from there too. Earlier she is shown having a panic attack during a thunderstorm and fearing the colour red. Mark tracks her down and blackmails her into marrying him. She explains that she does not want to be touched, but during the "honeymoon", Mark rapes her. Marnie and Mark discover that Marnie's mother had been a prostitute when Marnie was a child, and that, while the mother was fighting with a client during a thunderstormthe mother believed the client had tried to molest MarnieMarnie had killed the client to save her mother. Cured of her fears when she remembers what happened, she decides to stay with Mark.&lt;ref name=Brody17Aug2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cleaver13Aug2012&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cleaver|first1=Emily|title=My favourite Hitchcock: Marnie|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/aug/13/my-favourite-hitchcock-marnie|work=The Guardian|date=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pat Nixon Alfred Hitchcock 1411-15A.jpg|thumb|The Hitchcocks with First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] and first daughter [[Julie Nixon Eisenhower]] in 1969]]

No longer speaking to her because she had rebuffed him, Hitchcock apparently referred to Hedren throughout as "the girl" rather than by name. He told [[Robert Burks]], the cinematographer, that the camera had to be placed as close as possible to Hedren when he filmed her face.{{sfn|Spoto|1999|p=471}} [[Ed McBain|Evan Hunter]], the screenwriter of ''The Birds'' who was writing ''Marnie'' too, explained to Hitchcock that, if Mark loved Marnie, he would comfort her, not rape her. Hitchcock reportedly replied: "Evan, when he sticks it in her, I want that camera right on her face!"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moral|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2WFCQednbTMC&amp;pg=PA37 37]}}, citing Evan Hunter (1997).

===Later years: 19661980===
====Final films====
Failing health reduced Hitchcock's output during the last two decades of his life. Biographer [[Stephen Rebello]] claimed Universal "forced" two movies on him, ''[[Torn Curtain]]'' (1966) and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'' (1969).&lt;ref name="Stephen Rebello 1990"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name="Leigh 1995"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2017}} Both were spy thrillers with [[Cold War]]-related themes. ''Torn Curtain'', with [[Paul Newman]] and [[Julie Andrews]], precipitated the bitter end of the 12-year collaboration between Hitchcock and composer [[Bernard Herrmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2002|pp=272274}}; {{cite news|last=Stephens|first=Andrew|title=The sound of Hitchcock: How Bernard Herrmann's music brought his films to life|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/the-sound-of-hitchcock-how-bernard-herrmanns-music-brought-his-films-to-life-20160104-glys29.html|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock was unhappy with Herrmann's score and replaced him with [[John Addison]], [[Jay Livingston]] and [[Ray Evans]].{{sfn|Smith|2002|pp=273274}} ''[[Topaz (novel)|Topaz]]'' (1967), based on a [[Leon Uris]] novel, is partly set in Cuba.

Hitchcock returned to Britain to make his penultimate film, ''[[Frenzy]]'' (1972), based on the novel ''[[Goodbye Piccadilly, Farewell Leicester Square]]'' (1966). After two espionage films, the plot marked a return to the murder-thriller genre. Richard Blaney ([[Jon Finch]]), a volatile barman with a history of explosive anger, becomes the prime suspect in the investigation into the "Necktie Murders", which are actually committed by his friend Bob Rusk ([[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]]). This time, Hitchcock makes the victim and villain kindreds, rather than opposites as in ''Strangers on a Train''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|pp=114115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Frenzy'', Hitchcock allowed nudity for the first time. Two scenes show naked women, one of whom is being raped and strangled;{{sfn|Evans|2017}} Spoto called the latter "one of the most repellent examples of a detailed murder in the history of film". Both actors, [[Barbara Leigh-Hunt]] and [[Anna Massey]], refused to do the scenes, so models were used instead.{{sfn|Spoto|1999|pp=513514}} Biographers have noted that Hitchcock had always pushed the limits of film censorship, often managing to fool [[Joseph Breen]], the longtime head of Hollywood's [[Motion Picture Production Code]]. Many times Hitchcock slipped in subtle hints of improprieties forbidden by censorship until the mid-1960s. Yet McGilligan wrote that Breen and others often realised that Hitchcock was inserting such things and were actually amused, as well as alarmed by Hitchcock's "inescapable inferences".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Family Plot]]'' (1976) was Hitchcock's last film. It relates the escapades of "Madam" Blanche Tyler, played by [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]], a fraudulent spiritualist, and her taxi-driver lover [[Bruce Dern]], making a living from her phony powers. While ''Family Plot'' was based on the [[Victor Canning]] novel ''[[The Rainbird Pattern]]'' (1972), the novel's tone is more sinister. Screenwriter [[Ernest Lehman]] originally wrote the film with a dark tone but was pushed to a lighter, more comical tone by Hitchcock.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

====Knighthood and death====
&lt;!--add American Film Institute Life Achievement Award and speech about his wife--&gt;Toward the end of his life, Hitchcock was working on the script for a spy thriller, ''[[The Short Night]]'', collaborating with [[James Costigan]], [[Ernest Lehman]] and [[David Freeman (screenwriter)|David Freeman]]. Despite preliminary work, it was never filmed. Hitchcock's health was declining and he was worried about his wife, who had suffered a stroke. The screenplay was eventually published in Freeman's book ''The Last Days of Alfred Hitchcock'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|pp= 73134}}; {{harvnb|Freeman|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victims in ''The Lodger'' are all blondes. In ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935), [[Madeleine Carroll]] is put in handcuffs. [[Ingrid Bergman]], whom Hitchcock directed three times (''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), and ''[[Under Capricorn]]'' (1949)), is dark blonde. In ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), Lisa ([[Grace Kelly]]) risks her life by breaking into Lars Thorwald's apartment. In ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), Francie (Grace Kelly again) offers to help a man she believes is a burglar. In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958) and ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959) respectively, [[Kim Novak]] and [[Eva Marie Saint]] play the blonde heroines. In ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), [[Janet Leigh]]'s character steals $40,000 ({{Inflation|US|40,000|1960|fmt=eq}}) and is murdered by Norman Bates, a reclusive psychopath. [[Tippi Hedren]], a blonde, appears to be the focus of the attacks in ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963). In ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964), the title character, again played by Hedren, is a thief. Hitchcock's last blonde heroine was [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] as a phony psychic turned amateur sleuth in ''[[Family Plot]]'' (1976), his final film. In the same film, the diamond smuggler played by [[Karen Black]] wears a long blonde wig in several scenes.

His films often feature characters struggling in their relationships with their mothers, such as [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norman Bates]] in ''Psycho''. In ''North by Northwest'' (1959), Roger Thornhill ([[Cary Grant]]) is an innocent man ridiculed by his mother for insisting that shadowy, murderous men are after him. In ''The Birds'' (1963), the Rod Taylor character, an innocent man, finds his world under attack by vicious birds, and struggles to free himself from a clinging mother ([[Jessica Tandy]]). The killer in ''Frenzy'' (1972) has a loathing of women but idolises his mother. The villain Bruno in ''Strangers on a Train'' hates his father, but has an incredibly close relationship with his mother (played by [[Marion Lorne]]). Sebastian ([[Claude Rains]]) in ''Notorious'' has a clearly conflicting relationship with his mother, who is (rightly) suspicious of his new bride, Alicia Huberman ([[Ingrid Bergman]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaganski|1997|pp=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--replace source--&gt;

I said, "That's one of the things you've got to learn to have&amp;nbsp;... authority." Out of authority comes control and out of control you get the range&amp;nbsp;... Whether you do little acting, a lot of acting in a given scene. You know exactly where you're going. And these were the first things that she had to know.

Hitchcock became known for having remarked that "actors are cattle."{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=140}}{{efn|Hitchcock told Fallaci in 1963: "When they [actors] aren't cows, theyre children: that's something else Ive often said. And everyone knows that there are good children, bad children, and stupid children. The majority of actors, though, are stupid children. Theyre always quarreling, and they give themselves a lot of airs. The less I see of them, the happier I am. I had much less trouble directing fifteen hundred crows than one single actor. Ive always said that Walt Disney has the right idea. His actors are made of paper; when he doesnt like them, he can tear them up."{{sfn|Fallaci|1963}}}} During the filming of ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (1941 film)|Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith]]'' (1941), [[Carole Lombard]] brought three cows onto the set wearing the name tags of Lombard, [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]], and [[Gene Raymond]], the stars of the film, to surprise him.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=140}}

Hitchcock believed that actors should concentrate on their performances and leave work on script and character to the directors and screenwriters. He told [[Bryan Forbes]] in 1967: "I remember discussing with a method actor how he was taught and so forth. He said, 'We're taught using improvisation. We are given an idea and then we are turned loose to develop in any way we want to.' I said 'That's not acting. That's writing.'"&lt;ref name=HitchcockForbes&gt;{{cite web |title=Alfred Hitchcock |publisher=British Film Institute|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/interviews/hitchcock.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210051052/http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/interviews/hitchcock.html#actors |archivedate=10 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Slezak]] said that Hitchcock knew the mechanics of acting better than anyone he knew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=It's Only a Movie: Alfred Hitchcock A Personal Biography |publisher=Simon and Schuster |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oKRhkdxsFs8C&amp;pg=PT133}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Critics observed that, despite his reputation as a man who disliked actors, actors who worked with him often gave brilliant performances. He used the same actors in many of his films; Cary Grant worked with Hitchcock four times,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White|2011|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ingrid Bergman three. [[James Mason]] said that Hitchcock regarded actors as "animated props".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whitty|2016|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Hitchcock, the actors were part of the film's setting. He told Franois Truffaut: "[T]he chief requisite for an actor is the ability to do nothing well, which is by no means as easy as it sounds. He should be willing to be utilised and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera. He must allow the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Truffaut|1983|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing, storyboards and production===
Hitchcock planned his scripts in detail with his writers. In ''Writing with Hitchcock'' (2001), Steven DeRosa noted that Hitchcock supervised them through every draft, asking that they tell the story visually.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|DeRosa|2001|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told [[Roger Ebert]] in 1969:

{{quote|Once the screenplay is finished, I'd just as soon not make the film at all. All the fun is over. I have a strongly visual mind. I visualize a picture right down to the final cuts. I write all this out in the greatest detail in the script, and then I don't look at the script while I'm shooting. I know it off by heart, just as an orchestra conductor needs not look at the score. It's melancholy to shoot a picture. When you finish the script, the film is perfect. But in shooting it you lose perhaps 40 per cent of your original conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Ebert|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/hitchcock-never-mess-about-with-a-dead-body-you-may-be-one|title=Hitchcock: "Never mess about with a dead bodyyou may be one&amp;nbsp;....|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=14 December 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hitchcock's films were extensively [[storyboard]]ed to the finest detail. He was reported to have never even bothered looking through the [[viewfinder]], since he did not need to, although in publicity photos he was shown doing so. He also used this as an excuse to never have to change his films from his initial vision. If a studio asked him to change a film, he would claim that it was already shot in a single way, and that there were no alternate takes to consider.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[File:Alfred Hitchcock on the set of North By Northwest.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Image of Hitchcock pictured under Mount Rushmore during the filming of North by Northwest|Hitchcock at [[Mount Rushmore]] filming ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959)]]
This view of Hitchcock as a director who relied more on pre-production than on the actual production itself has been challenged by Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of French film magazine ''[[Cahiers du cinma]]'', in his book ''Hitchcock at Work''. After investigating script revisions, notes to other production personnel written by or to Hitchcock, and other production material, Krohn observed that Hitchcock's work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned.&lt;ref name= "krohn17"&gt;{{harvnb|Krohn|2000|pp=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to Hitchcock, often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his films, was to a great degree perpetuated by Hitchcock himself or the publicity arm of the studios. For example, the celebrated crop-spraying sequence of ''North by Northwest'' was not storyboarded at all. After the scene was filmed, the publicity department asked Hitchcock to make storyboards to promote the film, and Hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detail.&lt;ref name="Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217"&gt;{{harvnb|Bellour|Penley|2000|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=December 2017}}

Even when storyboards were made, scenes that were shot differed from them significantly. Krohn's analysis of the production of Hitchcock classics like ''Notorious'' reveals that Hitchcock was flexible enough to change a film's conception during its production. Another example Krohn notes is the American remake of ''The Man Who Knew Too Much,'' whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule, something that, as Krohn notes, was not an uncommon occurrence on many of Hitchcock's films, including ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]''. While Hitchcock did do a great deal of preparation for all his films, he was fully cognisant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best-laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines utilised during many other film productions.&lt;ref name="Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217"/&gt;{{verify source|date=December 2017}}

[[File:Alfred Hitchcock Extended Interview.ogv|thumb|alt= Close-up of Hitchcock for a media clip of a 1966 interview|Hitchcock interview, around 1966]]
Krohn's work also sheds light on Hitchcock's practice of generally shooting in chronological order, which he notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and, more importantly, differed from the standard operating procedure of Hollywood in the Studio System Era. Equally important is Hitchcock's tendency to shoot alternate takes of scenes. This differed from coverage in that the films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give the editor options to shape the film how he/she chooses (often under the producer's aegis).&lt;ref name="Heritage02-28-07"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lehman|first=David|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml|title=Alfred Hitchcock's America|work=American Heritage|date=AprilMay 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711184905/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml|archivedate=11 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2017}} Rather they represented Hitchcock's tendency to give himself options in the editing room, where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of the work. According to Krohn, this and a great deal of other information revealed through his research of Hitchcock's personal papers, script revisions and the like refute the notion of Hitchcock as a director who was always in control of his films, whose vision of his films did not change during production, which Krohn notes has remained the central long-standing myth of Alfred Hitchcock. Both his fastidiousness and attention to detail also found their way into each [[film poster]] for his films. Hitchcock preferred to work with the best talent of his dayfilm poster designers such as [[Bill Gold]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The New York Times|title=Poster Master With a Cool Hand|first=Mekado|last=Murphy|date=3 December 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/movies/05posters.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saul Bass]]who would produce posters that accurately represented his films.&lt;ref name="Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217"/&gt;{{verify source|date=December 2017}}
