{{Martin Luther King Jr. sidebar}}
'''Martin Luther King Jr.''' (January 15, 1929&amp;nbsp; April 4, 1968) was an American [[Baptist]] minister and activist who became the most visible spokesperson and leader in the [[civil rights movement]] from 1954 until his death in 1968. King is best known for advancing [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] through [[nonviolence]] and [[civil disobedience]], tactics his [[Christian]] beliefs and the nonviolent activism of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] helped inspire.

King led the 1955 [[Montgomery bus boycott]] and in 1957 became the first president of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC). With the SCLC, he led an unsuccessful [[Albany Movement|1962 struggle against segregation]] in [[Albany, Georgia]], and helped organize the nonviolent 1963 protests in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. He also helped organize the 1963 [[March on Washington]], where he delivered his famous "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech. 

On October 14, 1964, King won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for combating [[Racism in the United States|racial inequality]] through [[nonviolent resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/1014.html |title=Martin Luther King Wins The Nobel Prize for Peace |date=October 15, 1964 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=February 13, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, he helped organize the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]]. The following year, he and the SCLC took the movement north to [[Chicago]] to work on segregated housing. In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards [[Poverty in the United States|poverty]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. He alienated many of his [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] allies with a 1967 speech titled "[[Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence|Beyond Vietnam]]". [[J. Edgar Hoover]] considered him a radical and made him an object of the FBI's [[COINTELPRO]] from 1963 on. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, recorded his extramarital liaisons and reported on them to government officials, and on one occasion mailed King a threatening anonymous letter, which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide.

In 1968, King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., to be called the [[Poor People's Campaign]], when he was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassinated]] on April 4 in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. His death was followed by [[King assassination riots|riots in many U.S. cities]]. Allegations that [[James Earl Ray]], the man convicted of killing King, had been framed or acted in concert with government agents persisted for decades after the shooting.
He was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] and the [[Congressional Gold Medal]]. [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]] was established as a holiday in numerous cities and states beginning in 1971, and as a [[U.S. federal holiday]] in 1986. [[List of streets named after Martin Luther King Jr.|Hundreds of streets]] in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, and a [[King County, Washington|county]] in Washington State was also rededicated for him. The [[Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial]] on the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C., was dedicated in 2011.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Atlanta Trip 130.JPG|alt=|thumb|300px|The high school that King attended was named after African-American educator [[Booker T. Washington]].]]
King was born on January 15, 1929, in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], to the Reverend [[Martin Luther King Sr.]] and [[Alberta Williams King]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=All Deliberate Speed: Reflections on the First Half Century of Brown v. Board of Education| publisher=W W Norton &amp; Co | p=138 | last=Ogletree | first=Charles J. | isbn=0-393-05897-2| year=2004}}
&lt;/ref&gt; King's legal name at birth was Michael King, and his father was also born Michael King, but, after a period of gradual transition on the elder King's part, he changed both his and his son's names in 1934.&lt;ref name="The King Center"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|King|1992|pp=3031}} The elder King would later state that "Michael" was a mistake by the attending physician to his son's birth,&lt;ref name=Snopes&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.snopes.com/history/american/mlking.asp |title=Four Things About King |last=Mikkelson |first=David |date=July 19, 2003 |website=Snopes |publisher=Snopes.com |access-date=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the younger King's birth certificate was altered to read "Martin Luther King Jr." in 1957.{{sfn|King|1992|p=31}} King's parents were both African-American, and he also had [[Irish American|Irish]] ancestry through his paternal great-grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=King, James Albert|url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_king_james_albert_1864_1933/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nsenga|first=Burton|title=AfricanAncestry.com Reveals Roots of MLK and Marcus Garvey|url=http://www.theroot.com/africanancestry-com-reveals-roots-of-mlk-and-marcus-gar-1790862357}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Alondra|last=Nelson|title=The Social Life of DNA|pages=160161|date=2016|isbn=9780807027189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King was a middle child, between older sister [[Christine King Farris]] and younger brother [[A.D. King]].{{sfn|King|1992|p=76}} King sang with his church choir at the 1939 Atlanta premiere of the movie ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Katznelson| first=Ira| page=5| title=When Affirmative Action was White: An Untold History of Racial Inequality in Twentieth-Century America| isbn=0-393-05213-3| year=2005| publisher=WW Norton &amp; Co}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he enjoyed singing and music. His mother was an accomplished organist and choir leader who took him to various churches to sing, and he received attention for singing "I Want to Be More and More Like Jesus". King later became a member of the junior choir in his church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Martin Luther King Jr.: Young Man with a Dream|first=Dharathula H.|last=Millender|pp=4546|year=1986|isbn=978-0-02-042010-1|publisher=Aladdin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King said that his father regularly whipped him until he was fifteen; a neighbor reported hearing the elder King telling his son "he would make something of him even if he had to beat him to death." King saw his father's proud and fearless protests against segregation, such as King Sr. refusing to listen to a traffic policeman after being referred to as "boy," or stalking out of a store with his son when being told by a shoe clerk that they would have to "move to the rear" of the store to be served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Marshall|last=Frady|title=Martin Luther King, Jr: A Life|pp=1215|date=2005|isbn=978-0-14-303648-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When King was a child, he befriended a white boy whose father owned a business near his family's home. When the boys were six, they started school: King had to attend a school for African Americans and the other boy went to one for whites (public schools were among the facilities segregated by state law). King lost his friend because the child's father no longer wanted the boys to play together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|first=Alan|last=Pierce|p=14|year=2004|publisher=Abdo Pub Co|isbn=978-1-59197-727-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King suffered from [[depression (mood disorder)|depression]] through much of his life. In his adolescent years, he initially felt resentment against whites due to the "racial humiliation" that he, his family, and his neighbors often had to endure in the segregated South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blake|first=John|title=How MLK became an angry black man|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/16/us/king-birmingham-jail-letter-anniversary/}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 12, shortly after his maternal grandmother died, King blamed himself and jumped out of a second-story window, but survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carson|first=Clayborn|title=Martin Luther King Jr.|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/318311/Martin-Luther-King-Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King was initially skeptical of many of Christianity's claims. At the age of 13, he denied the [[Resurrection of Jesus|bodily resurrection of Jesus]] during [[Sunday school]].&lt;ref name=Autobiography&gt;{{cite web|title=An Autobiography of Religious Development|url=http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/documentsentry/doc_501122_00/|website=The Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=April 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this point, he stated, "doubts began to spring forth unrelentingly."{{sfn|King|1998|p=6}}&lt;ref name=Autobiography/&gt; However, he later concluded that the Bible has "many profound truths which one cannot escape" and decided to enter the [[seminary]].&lt;ref name=Autobiography/&gt;

Growing up in Atlanta, King attended [[Washington High School (Atlanta)|Booker T. Washington High School]]. He became known for his public speaking ability and was part of the school's debate team.&lt;ref name=Fleming9 /&gt; When King was thirteen in 1942, he became the youngest assistant manager of a newspaper delivery station for the ''[[Atlanta Journal]]''.{{sfn|King|1992|p=82}} During his junior year, he won first prize in an oratorical contest sponsored by the Negro Elks Club in [[Dublin, Georgia]]. On the ride home to Atlanta by bus, he and his teacher were ordered by the driver to stand so that white passengers could sit down. King initially refused but complied after his teacher told him that he would be breaking the law if he did not submit. During this incident, King said that he was "the angriest I have ever been in my life."&lt;ref name=Fleming9&gt;{{cite book|title=Martin Luther King Jr.: A Dream of Hope|page=9|first=Alice|last=Fleming|year=2008|publisher=Sterling|isbn=978-1-4027-4439-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An outstanding student, he skipped both the ninth and the twelfth grades of high school.{{sfn|King|1992|pp=3536}}

During King's junior year in high school, [[Morehouse College]]a respected [[historically black college]]announced that it would accept any high school juniors who could pass its entrance exam. At that time, many students had abandoned further studies to enlist in [[World War II]]. Due to this, Morehouse was eager to fill its classrooms. At the age of 15, King passed the exam and entered Morehouse.&lt;ref name=Fleming9 /&gt; The summer before his last year at Morehouse, in 1947, the 18-year-old King chose to enter the ministry. He had concluded that the church offered the most assuring way to answer "an inner urge to serve humanity." King's "inner urge" had begun developing, and he made peace with the Baptist Church, as he believed he would be a "rational" minister with sermons that were "a respectful force for ideas, even social protest."{{sfn|Frady|2002|p=18}}

In 1948, King graduated at age 19 from Morehouse with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[sociology]]. He then enrolled in [[Crozer Theological Seminary]] in [[Chester, Pennsylvania]], from which he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Divinity|B.Div.]] degree in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=To See the Promised Land: The Faith Pilgrimage of Martin Luther King, Jr | p=150| last=Downing | first=Frederick L.| publisher=Mercer University Press| year=1986| isbn=0-86554-207-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; King's father fully supported his decision to continue his education.

While attending Crozer, King was joined by Walter McCall, a former classmate at Morehouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Through It All: Reflections on My Life, My Family, and My Faith|pages=4447|first=Christine King|last=Farris|authorlink=Christine King Farris|year=2009|publisher=Atria Books|isbn=978-1-4165-4881-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Crozer, King was elected president of the student body.{{sfn|Frady|2002|pp=2022}} The African-American students of Crozer for the most part conducted their social activity on Edwards Street. King became fond of the street because a classmate had an aunt who prepared collard greens for them, which they both relished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=King: A Biography|first=David|last=L. Lewis|p=27|year=2013|publisher=University of Illinois Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King once reproved another student for keeping beer in his room, saying they had shared responsibility as African Americans to bear "the burdens of the Negro race." For a time, he was interested in [[Walter Rauschenbusch]]'s "social gospel."{{sfn|Frady|2002|pp=2022}} In his third year at Morehouse, King became romantically involved with the white daughter of an immigrant German woman who worked as a cook in the cafeteria. The daughter had been involved with a professor prior to her relationship with King. King planned to marry her, but friends advised against it, saying that an interracial marriage would provoke animosity from both blacks and whites, potentially damaging his chances of ever pastoring a church in the South. King tearfully told a friend that he could not endure his mother's pain over the marriage and broke the relationship off six months later. He continued to have lingering feelings toward the women he left; one friend was quoted as saying, "He never recovered."{{sfn|Frady|2002|pp=2022}}

King married [[Coretta Scott King|Coretta Scott]] on June 18, 1953, on the lawn of her parents' house in her hometown of [[Heiberger, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; They became the parents of four children: [[Yolanda King]] (19552007), [[Martin Luther King III]] (b. 1957), [[Dexter Scott King]] (b. 1961), and [[Bernice King]] (b. 1963).&lt;ref name=fam&gt;{{cite book|title=King Came Preaching: The Pulpit Power of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr |p=35|last= Warren|first= Mervyn A. |isbn= 0-8308-2658-0 |year= 2001 | publisher=InterVarsity Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; During their marriage, King limited Coretta's role in the civil rights movement, expecting her to be a housewife and mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwVbfvfYEZkC&amp;pg=PA408 |title=Civil Rights History from the Ground Up: Local Struggles, a National Movement|p=410|publisher=University of Georgia Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 25 in 1954, King was called as pastor of the [[Dexter Avenue Baptist Church]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Fuller | first=Linda K.| p=314| publisher=Greenwood Publishing| year=2004| isbn=0-275-97270-4 | title=National Days, National Ways: Historical, Political, And Religious Celebrations around the World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doctoral studies===
{{see also|Martin Luther King Jr. authorship issues}}
King began doctoral studies in [[systematic theology]] at [[Boston University]] and received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree on June 5, 1955, with a [[dissertation]] (initially supervised by [[Edgar S. Brightman]] and, upon the latter's death, by [[Lotan Harold DeWolf]]) titled ''A Comparison of the Conceptions of God in the Thinking of [[Paul Tillich]] and [[Henry Nelson Wieman]].''&lt;ref name=Radin/&gt; While pursuing doctoral studies, King worked as an assistant minister at Boston's historic [[Twelfth Baptist Church, Boston|Twelfth Baptist Church]] with Rev. William Hunter Hester. Hester was an old friend of King's father, and was an important influence on King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baldwin|first1=Lewis V.|title=The Voice of Conscience: The Church in the Mind of Martin Luther King, Jr.|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195380316|pp=4244|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BVWBdKUylBYC&amp;pg=PA42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decades later, an academic inquiry in October 1991 concluded that portions of his dissertation had been [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] and he had acted improperly. However, {{nowrap|"[d]espite}} its finding, the committee said that 'no thought should be given to the revocation of Dr. King's doctoral degree,' an action that the panel said would serve no purpose."&lt;ref name=Radin&gt;{{cite news |title=Panel Confirms Plagiarism by King at BU |first=Charles A. |last=Radin |work=The Boston Globe |date=October 11, 1991 |page=1}}

A letter is now attached to the copy of King's dissertation held in the university library, noting that numerous passages were included without the appropriate quotations and citations of sources.&lt;ref&gt;

In March 1955, [[Claudette Colvin]]a fifteen-year-old black schoolgirl in Montgomeryrefused to give up her bus seat to a white man in violation of [[Jim Crow laws]], local laws in the [[Southern United States]] that enforced [[racial segregation]]. King was on the committee from the Birmingham African-American community that looked into the case; [[Edgar Nixon|E. D. Nixon]] and [[Clifford Durr]] decided to wait for a better case to pursue because the incident involved a minor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Martin Luther King Jr.: Dreaming of Equality |last=Manheimer|first=Ann S. |page=103|year=2004|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|isbn=1-57505-627-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine months later on December 1, 1955, a similar incident occurred when [[Rosa Parks]] was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a city bus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=December 1, 1955: Rosa Parks arrested| date=March 11, 2003|publisher=CNN|accessdate=June 8, 2008|url= http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/03/10/sprj.80.1955.parks/}}

==Southern Christian Leadership Conference==
In 1957, King, [[Ralph Abernathy]], [[Fred Shuttlesworth]], [[Joseph Lowery]], and other civil rights activists founded the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC). The group was created to harness the [[moral authority]] and organizing power of black churches to conduct nonviolent protests in the service of civil rights reform. The group was inspired by the crusades of evangelist [[Billy Graham]], who befriended King after he attended a 1957 Graham crusade in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WBKaYVni9Z8C&amp;pg=PA92|title=Billy Graham and the Rise of the Republican South|page=92|first=Steven P. |last=Miller|year=2009|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-8122-4151-8|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; King led the SCLC until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Let Nobody Turn Us Around: Voices of Resistance, Reform, and Renewal: an African American Anthology|last= Marable| first= Manning | first2=Leith|last2=Mullings|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=0-8476-8346-X|year=2000|pages=3912}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SCLC's 1957 [[Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom]] was the first time King addressed a national audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom|url=http://crdl.usg.edu/events/prayer_pilgrimage/?Welcome|publisher=Civil Rights Digital Library|accessdate=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other civil rights leaders involved in the SCLC with King included: [[James Bevel]], [[Allen Johnson (activist)|Allen Johnson]], [[Curtis W.

On September 20, 1958, King was signing copies of his book ''[[Stride Toward Freedom]]'' in Blumstein's department store in Harlem&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Hugh (2002).

&lt;/ref&gt; when he narrowly escaped death. [[Izola Curry]]a mentally ill black woman who thought that King was conspiring against her with communistsstabbed him in the chest with a letter opener. King underwent emergency surgery with three doctors: [[Aubre de Lambert Maynard]], Emil Naclerio and [[John W. V. Cordice]]; he remained hospitalized for several weeks. Curry was later found mentally incompetent to stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-7694472.html |title='King' is a Deft Exploration of the Civil Rights Leader's Stabbing |date=February 4, 2002 |author=Graham, Renee |work=The Boston Globe |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-51d3eceac5094ac7a08d8dd326287c79.html |title=Today in History, September 20 |agency=Associated Press |date=September 19, 2012|publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, he published a short book called ''The Measure of A Man'', which contained his sermons "[[What Is Man? (King essay)|What is Man?]]" and "The Dimensions of a Complete Life." The sermons argued for man's need for God's love and criticized the racial injustices of Western civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_the_measure_of_man_1959/ |title=Measure of a Man, The (1959) |work=Martin Luther King Jr. and the Global Freedom Struggle |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=January 24, 2013 |archivedate=January 24, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DukPjX2x?url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_the_measure_of_man_1959/ |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harry H. Wachtel|Harry Wachtel]] joined King's legal advisor Clarence B. Jones in defending four ministers of the SCLC in the libel case ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]''; the case was litigated in reference to the newspaper advertisement "[[Heed Their Rising Voices]]". Wachtel founded a tax-exempt fund to cover the expenses of the suit and to assist the nonviolent civil rights movement through a more effective means of fundraising. This organization was named the "Gandhi Society for Human Rights." King served as honorary president for the group. He was displeased with the pace that President Kennedy was using to address the issue of segregation. In 1962, King and the Gandhi Society produced a document that called on the President to follow in the footsteps of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and issue an executive order to deliver a blow for civil rights as a kind of [[Second Emancipation Proclamation]]. Kennedy did not execute the order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_gandhi_society_for_human_rights/|title=Martin Luther King Jr. and the Global Freedom Struggle: Gandhi Society for Human Rights|publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] was under written directive from Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]] when it began [[telephone tapping|tapping]] King's telephone line in the fall of 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The FBI: A Comprehensive Reference Guide|last= Theoharis | first= Athan G. |first2=Tony G.|last2=Poveda|first3=Richard Gid|last3=Powers|first4=Susan|last4=Rosenfeld|page=148|isbn=0-89774-991-X| publisher=Greenwood Publishing | year=1999}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Kennedy was concerned that public allegations of communists in the SCLC would derail the administration's civil rights initiatives. He warned King to discontinue these associations and later felt compelled to issue the written directive that authorized the FBI to wiretap King and other SCLC leaders.{{sfn|Herst|2007|pp=37274}} FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] feared the civil rights movement and investigated the allegations of communist infiltration. When no evidence emerged to support this, the FBI used the incidental details caught on tape over the next five years in attempts to force King out of his leadership position, in the [[COINTELPRO]] program.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book| title=The FBI: A Comprehensive Reference Guide|last=Theoharis|first=Athan G.|first2=Tony G.|last2=Poveda|first3=Richard Gid|last3=Powers|first4=Susan|last4=Rosenfeld| page=123|isbn=0-89774-991-X|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King believed that organized, nonviolent protest against the system of southern segregation known as [[Jim Crow laws]] would lead to extensive media coverage of the struggle for black equality and voting rights. Journalistic accounts and televised footage of the daily deprivation and indignities suffered by Southern blacks, and of segregationist violence and harassment of civil rights workers and marchers, produced a wave of sympathetic public opinion that convinced the majority of Americans that the civil rights movement was the most important issue in American politics in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Race and Labor Matters in the New U.S. Economy|last=Wilson|first=Joseph|first2=Manning|last2=Marable|first3=Immanuel|last3=Ness| page= 47|isbn= 0-7425-4691-8|publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year= 2006}}

King organized and led marches for blacks' right to [[Voting|vote]], [[desegregation]], [[labor rights]], and other basic civil rights.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=53}} Most of these rights were successfully enacted into the [[law of the United States]] with the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the 1965 [[Voting Rights Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= International Encyclopedia of Public Policy and Administration|last=Shafritz|first= Jay M.|page= 1242|year= 1998| isbn=0-8133-9974-2| publisher= Westview Press}}

King and the SCLC put into practice many of the principles of the [[Christian Left]] and applied the tactics of nonviolent protest with great success by strategically choosing the method of protest and the places in which protests were carried out. There were often dramatic stand-offs with segregationist authorities, who sometimes turned violent.{{sfn|Glisson|2006|p=190}}

King was criticized by many groups during the course of his participation in the civil rights movement. This included opposition by more militant blacks such as [[Nation of Islam (religious movement)|Nation of Islam]] member [[Malcolm X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page= 105| publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2007|isbn=0-7425-2928-2|last=Bobbitt|first=David|title=The Rhetoric of Redemption: Kenneth Burke's Redemption Drama and Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" Speech}}

===Albany Movement, 1961===
{{Main|Albany Movement}}
The Albany Movement was a desegregation coalition formed in [[Albany, Georgia]], in November 1961. In December, King and the SCLC became involved. The movement mobilized thousands of citizens for a broad-front nonviolent attack on every aspect of segregation within the city and attracted nationwide attention. When King first visited on December 15, 1961, he "had planned to stay a day or so and return home after giving counsel."&lt;ref name=Hatchette&gt;King, Martin Luther. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pynSnGuC964C&amp;pg=PT147 The Autobiography of Martin Luther King Jr.] Hatchette Digital. 2001. Accessed January 4, 2013.
&lt;/ref&gt;
The following day he was swept up in a [[mass arrest]] of peaceful demonstrators, and he declined bail until the city made concessions. According to King, "that agreement was dishonored and violated by the city" after he left town.&lt;ref name=Hatchette /&gt;

King returned in July 1962 and was given the option of forty-five days in jail or a $178 fine ({{Inflation|US|178|1962|r=-2|fmt=eq}}); he chose jail. Three days into his sentence, Police Chief Laurie Pritchett discreetly arranged for King's fine to be paid and ordered his release. "We had witnessed persons being kicked off lunch counter stools&amp;nbsp;... ejected from churches&amp;nbsp;... and thrown into jail&amp;nbsp;... But for the first time, we witnessed being kicked out of jail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Testament of Hope: The Essential Writings and Speeches of Martin Luther King Jr. |last=King |first=Martin Luther |year=1990 |publisher=Harper Collins |isbn=978-0-06-064691-2 |page=105 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qnoc3JhV5iUC&amp;pg=PA106}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later acknowledged by the King Center that [[Billy Graham]] was the one who bailed King out of jail during this time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/theme/2179 King Center:Billy Graham] Accessed September 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

After nearly a year of intense activism with few tangible results, the movement began to deteriorate. King requested a halt to all demonstrations and a "Day of Penance" to promote nonviolence and maintain the moral high ground. Divisions within the black community and the canny, low-key response by local government defeated efforts.{{sfn|Glisson|2006|pp=19093}} Though the Albany effort proved a key lesson in tactics for King and the national civil rights movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis61.htm#1961albany| title= Albany, GA Movement|publisher= Civil Rights Movement Veterans | accessdate=September 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the national media was highly critical of King's role in the defeat, and the SCLC's lack of results contributed to a growing gulf between the organization and the more radical SNCC. After Albany, King sought to choose engagements for the SCLC in which he could control the circumstances, rather than entering into pre-existing situations.{{sfn|Frady|2002|p=96}}

===Birmingham campaign, 1963===
{{Main|Birmingham campaign}}
[[File:MLK mugshot birmingham.jpg|thumb|300px|King was arrested in 1963 for protesting the treatment of blacks in Birmingham.]]
In April 1963, the SCLC began a campaign against racial segregation and economic injustice in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. The campaign used nonviolent but intentionally confrontational tactics, developed in part by Rev. [[Wyatt Tee Walker]]. Black people in Birmingham, organizing with the SCLC, occupied public spaces with marches and [[sit-in]]s, openly violating laws that they considered unjust.

King's intent was to provoke mass arrests and "create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation."&lt;ref&gt;Garrow, (1986) p.&amp;nbsp;246.
&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign's early volunteers did not succeed in shutting down the city, or in drawing media attention to the police's actions. Over the concerns of an uncertain King, SCLC strategist [[James Bevel]] changed the course of the campaign by recruiting children and young adults to join in the demonstrations.&lt;ref name="McWhorter 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=McWhorter|first=Diane|title=Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama: The Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution|year=2001|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-2648-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7jnr8GdvSZcC|chapter=Two Mayors and a King}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the protests, the Birmingham Police Department, led by [[Eugene "Bull" Connor]], used high-pressure water jets and police dogs against protesters, including children. Footage of the police response was broadcast on national television news and dominated the nation's attention, shocking many white Americans and consolidating black Americans behind the movement.{{sfn|Frady|2002|pp=11314}} Not all of the demonstrators were peaceful, despite the avowed intentions of the SCLC. In some cases, bystanders attacked the police, who responded with force. King and the SCLC were criticized for putting children in harm's way. But the campaign was a success: Connor lost his job, the "Jim Crow" signs came down, and public places became more open to blacks. King's reputation improved immensely.&lt;ref name="Harrell 2005 1055"/&gt;

King was arrested and jailed early in the campaignhis 13th arrest&lt;ref name="newsweek4-22"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Integration: Connor and King|journal=[[Newsweek]]|date=April 22, 1963|pages=&amp;nbsp;28,&amp;nbsp;33}}&lt;/ref&gt; out of 29.&lt;ref name="holiday"&gt;{{cite web|last=King |first=Coretta Scott |title=The Meaning of The King Holiday |url=http://www.thekingcenter.org/meaning-king-holiday |publisher=The King Center |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |archivedate=January 9, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DXtPnY4E?url=http://www.thekingcenter.org/meaning-king-holiday |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; From his cell, he composed the now-famous [[Letter from Birmingham Jail]] that responds to [[A Call for Unity|calls on the movement]] to pursue legal channels for social change. King argues that the crisis of racism is too urgent, and the current system too entrenched: "We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed."&lt;ref name=LetterFromBirmJail /&gt; He points out that the [[Boston Tea Party]], a celebrated act of rebellion in the American colonies, was illegal civil disobedience, and that, conversely, "everything [[Adolf Hitler]] did in Germany was 'legal'."&lt;ref name=LetterFromBirmJail /&gt; King also expresses his frustration with white moderates and clergymen too timid to oppose an unjust system:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Councilor or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action"; who paternalistic-ally believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a "more convenient season."&lt;ref name=LetterFromBirmJail&gt;{{cite web|last=King |first=Martin Luther |title=Letter from Birmingham Jail |date=April 16, 1963 |publisher=The Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute |url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/resources/article/annotated_letter_from_birmingham/ |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |archivedate=January 9, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DXtUBxxX?url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/resources/article/annotated_letter_from_birmingham/ |deadurl=no |df=mdy }} King began writing the letter on newspaper margins and continued on bits of paper brought by friends.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===St. Augustine, Florida, 1964===
{{Main|St. Augustine movement}}
In March 1964, King and the SCLC joined forces with Robert Hayling's then-controversial movement in St. Augustine, Florida. Hayling's group had been affiliated with the NAACP but was forced out of the organization for advocating armed self-defense alongside nonviolent tactics. However, the pacifist SCLC accepted them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augustine.com/history/black_history/dr_robert_hayling/ Augustine.com&amp;nbsp; "Black History: Dr. Robert B. Hayling"] ; David J.

&lt;/ref&gt;
During June, the movement marched nightly through the city, "often facing counter demonstrations by the Klan, and provoking violence that garnered national media attention." Hundreds of the marchers were arrested and jailed. During the course of this movement, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed.&lt;ref name="KOE"&gt;{{cite web|title=St. Augustine Movement |url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_st_augustine_movement/ |work=King Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |archivedate=January 9, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DXtaBV4v?url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_st_augustine_movement/ |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A local judge issued an injunction that barred any gathering of three or more people affiliated with the SNCC, SCLC, DCVL, or any of 41 named civil rights leaders.

===New York City, 1964===
On February 6, 1964, King delivered the inaugural speech of a lecture series initiated at the [[New School]] called "The American Race Crisis." No audio record of his speech has been found, but in August 2013, almost 50 years later, the school discovered an audiotape with 15 minutes of a question-and-answer session that followed King's address. In these remarks, King referred to a conversation he had recently had with [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] in which he compared the sad condition of many African Americans to that of India's [[Dalit|untouchables]].&lt;ref name="El Naggar"&gt;{{cite news|last=El Naggar|first=Mona|title=Found After Decades, a Forgotten Tape of King 'Thinking on His Feet{{'-}}|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/22/found-after-decades-a-forgotten-tape-of-king-thinking-on-his-feet/|accessdate=August 31, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==March on Washington, 1963==

King, representing the SCLC, was among the leaders of the "Big Six" civil rights organizations who were instrumental in the organization of the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], which took place on August 28, 1963. The other leaders and organizations comprising the Big Six were [[Roy Wilkins]] from the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]]; [[Whitney Young]], [[National Urban League]]; [[A. Philip Randolph]], [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]]; [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]], SNCC; and [[James L. Farmer Jr.]], of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience|last=Gates|first=Henry Louis|first2=Anthony|last2=Appiah|publisher=Basic Civitas Books|isbn= 0-465-00071-1| year=1999| page=1251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayard Rustin's open homosexuality, support of [[democratic socialism]], and his former ties to the [[Communist Party USA]] caused many white and African-American leaders to demand King distance himself from Rustin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | page=62 | last=Arsenault|first=Raymond|title=Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice|isbn= 0-19-513674-8| publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which King agreed to do.{{sfn|Frady|2002|p=42}} However, he did collaborate in the 1963 March on Washington, for which Rustin was the primary logistical and strategic organizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages= 138143|first= David|last= De Leon|title= Leaders from the 1960s: A biographical sourcebook of American activism|year=1994|publisher=Greenwood Publishing |isbn= 0-313-27414-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c15NAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= African-Americans and the Quest for Civil Rights, 19001990| last= Cashman| first= Sean Dennis| page=162 | isbn=0-8147-1441-2|publisher=NYU Press|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For King, this role was another which courted controversy, since he was one of the key figures who acceded to the wishes of [[John F. Kennedy|United States President John F. Kennedy]] in changing the focus of the march.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Robert Kennedy and His Times|last=Schlesinger Jr. |first= Arthur M. |page= 351| isbn=0-618-21928-5|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Books|origyear=1978 | year=2002}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy initially opposed the march outright, because he was concerned it would negatively impact the drive for passage of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|civil rights legislation]]. However, the organizers were firm that the march would proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Kennedy, Johnson, and the Quest for Justice: The Civil Rights Tapes| last= Rosenberg|first= Jonathan|first2=Zachary|last2=Karabell| page= 130| isbn= 0-393-05122-6| year= 2003| publisher=WW Norton &amp; Co}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the march going forward, the Kennedys decided it was important to work to ensure its success. President Kennedy was concerned the turnout would be less than 100,000. Therefore, he enlisted the aid of additional church leaders and [[Walter Reuther]], president of  the [[United Automobile Workers]], to help mobilize demonstrators for the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Robert Kennedy and His Times|last=Schlesinger Jr. |first= Arthur M. |pages= 350, 351| isbn=0-618-21928-5|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Books|origyear=1978 | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|King gave his most famous speech, "I Have a Dream", before the [[Lincoln Memorial]] during the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]].]]
The march originally was conceived as an event to dramatize the desperate condition of blacks in the southern U.S. and an opportunity to place organizers' concerns and grievances squarely before the seat of power in the nation's capital. Organizers intended to denounce the federal government for its failure to safeguard the civil rights and physical safety of civil rights workers and blacks. The group acquiesced to presidential pressure and influence, and the event ultimately took on a far less strident tone.&lt;ref name=farce&gt;{{cite book | title=Living for Change: An Autobiography|last=Boggs|first=Grace Lee|page= 127|publisher= U of Minnesota Press|year= 1998 | isbn=0-8166-2955-2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result, some civil rights activists felt it presented an inaccurate, sanitized pageant of racial harmony; Malcolm X called it the "Farce on Washington", and the Nation of Islam forbade its members from attending the march.&lt;ref name=farce/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Mysteries in History: From Prehistory to the Present| last=Aron| first=Paul| page=399|isbn=1-85109-899-2|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2005}}

{{poemquote|I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.'
I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.
I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
I have a dream today.
I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; one day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.

The March, and especially King's speech, helped put civil rights at the top of the agenda of reformers in the United States and facilitated passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&lt;ref&gt;James T.

In 1963, Raveling, then 26, was standing near the podium, and immediately after the oration, impulsively asked King if he could have his copy of the speech.

==Selma voting rights movement and "Bloody Sunday", 1965==
{{Main|Selma to Montgomery marches}}
[[File:Selma to Montgomery Marches protesters.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The civil rights [[Selma to Montgomery marches|march from Selma to Montgomery]], Alabama, in 1965.]]

Acting on James Bevel's call for a march from Selma to Montgomery, King, Bevel, and the SCLC, in partial collaboration with SNCC, attempted to organize the march to the state's capital. The first attempt to march on March 7, 1965, was aborted because of mob and police violence against the demonstrators. This day has become known as [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Bloody Sunday]] and was a major turning point in the effort to gain public support for the civil rights movement. It was the clearest demonstration up to that time of the dramatic potential of King's nonviolence strategy. King, however, was not present.{{sfn|King|1998|p=6}}

On March 5, King met with officials in the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Administration|Johnson Administration]] in order to request an [[injunction]] against any prosecution of the demonstrators. He did not attend the march due to church duties, but he later wrote, "If I had any idea that the state troopers would use the kind of brutality they did, I would have felt compelled to give up my church duties altogether to lead the line."{{sfn|King|1998|pp=27679}} Footage of [[police brutality]] against the protesters was broadcast extensively and aroused national public outrage.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|pp=22223}}

King next attempted to organize a march for March 9. The SCLC petitioned for an injunction in federal court against the State of Alabama; this was denied and the judge issued an order blocking the march until after a hearing. Nonetheless, King led marchers on March 9 to the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] in Selma, then held a short prayer session before turning the marchers around and asking them to disperse so as not to violate the court order. The unexpected ending of this second march aroused the surprise and anger of many within the local movement.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=223}} The march finally went ahead fully on March 25, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Isserman|first= Maurice|title= America Divided: The Civil War of the 1960s |first2=Michael|last2=Kazin|page=175|publisher=Oxford University Pressk|year= 2000|isbn= 0-19-509190-6}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
At the conclusion of the march on the steps of the [[Alabama State Capitol|state capitol]], King delivered a speech that became known as "[[How Long, Not Long]]." In it, King stated that equal rights for African Americans could not be far away, "because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice" and "you shall reap what you sow".{{efn|Though commonly attributed to King, this expression originated with 19th-century abolitionist [[Theodore Parker]].&lt;ref name=NPR /&gt;}}&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129609461 |title=Theodore Parker And The 'Moral Universe' |date=September 2, 2010 |publisher=National Public Radio |accessdate=January 24, 2013 |archivedate=January 24, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DumX05kw?url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129609461 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Leeman|first= Richard W.| title= African-American Orators: A Bio-critical Sourcebook|page=220|isbn=0-313-29014-8|publisher=Greenwood Publishing |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media| people = Democracy Now!| title = Rare Video Footage of Historic Alabama 1965 Civil Rights Marches, MLK's Famous Montgomery Speech| accessdate = 2018-05-05| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBm48Scju9E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, after several successes in the south, King, Bevel, and others in the civil rights organizations took the movement to the North, with [[Chicago]] as their first destination. King and Ralph Abernathy, both from the middle class, moved into a building at 1550 S. Hamlin Avenue, in the slums of [[North Lawndale]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He spoke strongly against the U.S.'s role in the war, arguing that the U.S. was in Vietnam "to occupy it as an American colony"{{sfn|Robbins|2007|p=107}} and calling the U.S. government "the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today."{{sfn|Robbins|2007|p=102}} He also connected the war with economic injustice, arguing that the country needed serious moral change:

King also opposed the Vietnam War because it took money and resources that could have been [[Social programs in the United States|spent on social welfare at home]]. The [[United States Congress]] was spending more and more on the military and less and less on [[poverty reduction|anti-poverty programs]] at the same time.

King's stance on Vietnam encouraged [[Allard K.

On April 15, 1967, King participated and spoke at an anti-war march from Manhattan's Central Park to the [[United Nations]].

King also brought up issues of civil rights and the draft.

In 1968, King and the SCLC organized the "[[Poor People's Campaign]]" to address issues of economic justice. King traveled the country to assemble "a multiracial army of the poor" that would march on Washington to engage in nonviolent [[civil disobedience]] at the Capitol until Congress created an "economic bill of rights" for poor Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Ernesto B.|last=Vigil|title=The Crusade for Justice: Chicano Militancy and the Government's War on Dissent|page= 54| publisher =University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=0-299-16224-9|year=1999}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign was preceded by King's final book, ''[[Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?]]'' which laid out his view of how to address social issues and poverty. King quoted from [[Henry George]] and George's book, ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'', particularly in support of a [[basic income|guaranteed basic income]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Dan|title=Where Was Martin Luther King Heading?|url=http://savingcommunities.org/issues/race/king.martin.html|website=savingcommunities.org|accessdate=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Luther King&amp;nbsp; Final Advice |url=http://www.progress.org/tpr/martin-luther-king-final-advice/ |date=January 9, 2007 |website=The Progress Report |accessdate=February 4, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204201039/https://www.progress.org/tpr/martin-luther-king-final-advice/ |archivedate=February 4, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yglesias|first1=Matthew|title=Martin Luther King's Case for a Guaranteed Basic Income|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/08/28/martin_luther_king_guaranteed_basic_income.html|accessdate=January 20, 2015|agency=Slate|date=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign culminated in a march on Washington, D.C., demanding economic aid to the poorest communities of the United States.

King and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]] called on the government to invest in rebuilding America's cities. He felt that Congress had shown "hostility to the poor" by spending "military funds with alacrity and generosity." He contrasted this with the situation faced by poor Americans, claiming that Congress had merely provided "poverty funds with miserliness."&lt;ref name=lied/&gt; His vision was for change that was more revolutionary than mere reform: he cited systematic flaws of "racism, poverty, militarism and materialism", and argued that "reconstruction of society itself is the real issue to be faced."{{sfn|Lawson|Payne|Patterson|2006|p=14849}}

The Poor People's Campaign was controversial even within the civil rights movement. Rustin resigned from the march, stating that the goals of the campaign were too broad, that its demands were unrealizable, and that he thought that these campaigns would accelerate the backlash and repression on the poor and the black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Other American: The Life of Michael Harrington|last=Isserman|first=Maurice|page=281|isbn=1-58648-036-7|publisher=Public Affairs|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After King's death===
The plan to set up a [[shantytown]] in Washington, D.C., was carried out soon after the April 4 [[assassination]]. Criticism of King's plan was subdued in the wake of his death, and the SCLC received an unprecedented wave of donations for the purpose of carrying it out.

On April 3, King addressed a rally and delivered his "I've Been to the Mountaintop" address at [[Mason Temple]], the world headquarters of the [[Church of God in Christ]].

&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[prophetic]] [[peroration]] of the last speech of his life, in reference to the bomb threat, King said the following:

{{Quote |And then I got to Memphis. And some began to say the threats, or talk about the threats that were out. What would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers?

Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land. So I'm happy, tonight.

King was booked in Room 306 at the [[Lorraine Motel]] (owned by Walter Bailey) in Memphis. Abernathy, who was present at the assassination, testified to the [[United States House Select Committee on Assassinations]] that King and his entourage stayed at Room 306 so often that it was known as the "King-Abernathy suite."&lt;ref name="usdoj"&gt;{{cite book| title= United States Department of Justice Investigation of Recent Allegations Regarding the Assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr|chapter=King V.

According to Jesse Jackson, who was present, King's last words on the balcony before his assassination were spoken to musician [[Ben Branch]], who was scheduled to perform that night at an event King was attending: "Ben, make sure you play '[[Take My Hand, Precious Lord]]' in the meeting tonight.

King was fatally shot by [[James Earl Ray]] at 6:01&amp;nbsp;p.m., April 4, 1968, as he stood on the motel's second-floor balcony.

Two months after King's death, [[James Earl Ray]]who was on the loose from a previous prison escapewas captured at [[London Heathrow Airport]] while trying to leave England on a false Canadian passport.

Supporters of this assertion said that Ray's confession was given under pressure and that he had been threatened with the death penalty.&lt;ref name=cbs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Conspiracy Theories in American History: An Encyclopedia| last =Knight | first =Peter| page= 402| isbn= 1-57607-812-4| publisher= ABC-CLIO| year= 2003}}

They admitted that Ray was a thief and burglar, but claimed that he had no record of committing violent crimes with a weapon.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; However, prison records in different U.S. cities have shown that he was incarcerated on numerous occasions for charges of armed robbery.&lt;ref name=mlkassassin /&gt; In a 2008 interview with CNN, Jerry Ray, the younger brother of James Earl Ray, claimed that James was smart and was sometimes able to get away with armed robbery. Jerry Ray said that he had assisted his brother on one such robbery. "I never been with nobody as bold as he is," Jerry said. "He just walked in and put that gun on somebody, it was just like it's an everyday thing."&lt;ref name=mlkassassin /&gt;

Those suspecting a conspiracy in the assassination point to the two successive [[ballistics]] tests which proved that a rifle similar to Ray's [[Remington Arms|Remington]] Gamemaster had been the murder weapon.

Witnesses near King at the moment of his death said that the shot came from another location.

In 1997, King's son Dexter Scott King met with Ray, and publicly supported Ray's efforts to obtain a [[new trial]].&lt;ref name=CNN2&gt;{{cite news|title=James Earl Ray, convicted King assassin, dies|publisher=CNN|date=April 23, 1998|url=http://edition.cnn.com/US/9804/23/ray.obit/#2|accessdate=September 17, 2006}}

Two years later,  King's widow Coretta Scott King and the couple's children won a [[wrongful death claim]] against [[Loyd Jowers]] and "other unknown co-conspirators." Jowers claimed to have received $100,000 to arrange King's assassination. The jury of six whites and six blacks found in favor of the King family, finding Jowers to be complicit in a conspiracy against King and that government agencies were party to the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2000, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] completed the investigation into Jowers' claims but did not find evidence to support allegations about conspiracy.

In 2002, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that a church minister, Rev. Ronald Denton Wilson, claimed his father, Henry Clay Wilsonnot James Earl Rayassassinated King. He stated, "It wasn't a racist thing; he thought Martin Luther King was connected with communism, and he wanted to get him out of the way."

King researchers [[David Garrow]] and [[Gerald Posner]] disagreed with William F.

==Legacy==
[[File:Martin Luther King memorial Westminster Abbey.jpg|thumb|upright|Martin Luther King Jr. statue over the west entrance of [[Westminster Abbey]], installed in 1998.]]

King's main legacy was to secure progress on civil rights in the U.S. Just days after King's assassination, Congress passed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]].&lt;ref name=HUDHistory&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Fair Housing|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/aboutfheo/history|publisher=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|accessdate=April 19, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327032116/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fprogram_offices%2Ffair_housing_equal_opp%2Faboutfheo%2Fhistory|archivedate=March 27, 2012|df=mdy-all}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Title VIII of the Act, commonly known as the Fair Housing Act, prohibited discrimination in housing and housing-related transactions on the basis of race, religion, or national origin (later expanded to include sex, familial status, and disability). This legislation was seen as a tribute to King's struggle in his final years to combat residential discrimination in the U.S.&lt;ref name=HUDHistory /&gt;

Bush]]'s 1992 proclamation, the holiday is observed on the third Monday of January each year, near the time of King's birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=47329|title=Proclamation 6401&amp;nbsp; Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday | year =1992|publisher=The American Presidency Project| accessdate=September 8, 2008}}

On January 17, 2000, for the first time, Martin Luther King Jr. Day was officially observed in all fifty U.S. states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E0DC1031F935A15756C0A96F958260| title= Contrarian New Hampshire To Honor Dr. King, at Last|work=The New York Times|last= Goldberg|first=Carey|date=May 26, 1999 | accessdate=June 15, 2008}}

[[Arizona]] (1992), [[New Hampshire]] (1999) and [[Utah]] (2000) were the last three states to recognize the holiday.

&lt;/ref&gt; The Peace Committee operates out of the chaplaincies of the city's two universities, Northumbria and Newcastle, both of which remain centres for the study of Martin Luther King and the US civil rights movement. Inspired by King's vision, it undertakes a range of activities across the UK as it seeks to "build cultures of peace."

In 2017, Newcastle University unveiled a bronze statue of King to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his honorary doctorate ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/press/articles/archive/2017/11/martinlutherkingstatueunveiled/|title=Statue unveiled in honour of Martin Luther King Jr.|date=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Students Union also voted to rename their bar 'Luthers'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/new-name-newcastle-universitys-student-12725758|title=New name for Newcastle University's Student Union Mensbar revealed|date=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas, influences, and political stances==

===Religion===
[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mathew Ahmann in a crowd.) - NARA - 542015 - Restoration.jpg |thumb|King at the 1963 Civil Rights March in Washington, D.C.]]

As a [[Christian]] minister, King's main influence was [[Jesus Christ]] and the Christian gospels, which he would almost always quote in his religious meetings, speeches at church, and in public discourses. King's faith was strongly based in Jesus' commandment of [[Golden Rule|loving your neighbor as yourself]], loving God above all, and loving your enemies, praying for them and blessing them. His [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] thought was also based in the injunction to ''[[turn the other cheek]]'' in the [[Sermon on the Mount]], and Jesus' teaching of putting the sword back into its place (Matthew 26:52).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/resources/article/king_quotes_on_war_and_peace/ |title=Martin Luther King Jr., Justice Without Violence&amp;nbsp; April 3, 1957 |publisher=Mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu |accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his famous [[Letter from Birmingham Jail]], King urged action consistent with what he describes as Jesus' "extremist" love, and also quoted numerous other [[Christian pacifism|Christian pacifist]] authors, which was very usual for him. In another sermon, he stated:
{{Quote|Before I was a civil rights leader, I was a preacher of the Gospel. This was my first calling and it still remains my greatest commitment. You know, actually all that I do in civil rights I do because I consider it a part of my ministry. I have no other ambitions in life but to achieve excellence in the Christian ministry. I don't plan to run for any political office. I don't plan to do anything but remain a preacher. And what I'm doing in this struggle, along with many others, grows out of my feeling that the preacher must be concerned about the whole man.&lt;ref&gt;The Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute.

In his speech "[[I've Been to the Mountaintop]]", he stated that he just wanted to do [[God's will]].

===Nonviolence===
[[File:BayardRustinAug1963-LibraryOfCongress crop.jpg|alt=A close-up of Rustin|thumb|King worked alongside Quakers such as [[Bayard Rustin]] to develop non-violent tactics.]]

Veteran African-American civil rights activist [[Bayard Rustin]] was King's first regular advisor on nonviolence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spirit of the Sixties: Making Postwar Radicalism| last= Farrell|first= James J.|page= 90|isbn= 0-415-91385-3|publisher= Routledge| year= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; King was also advised by the white activists [[Harris Wofford]] and [[Glenn Smiley]].&lt;ref name="mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_wofford_harris_llewellyn_1926/|title=Wofford, Harris Llewellyn (1926 )|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rustin and Smiley came from the [[Christian pacifist]] tradition, and Wofford and Rustin both studied Gandhi's teachings. Rustin had applied nonviolence with the [[Journey of Reconciliation]] campaign in the 1940s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Book Review: Bayard Rustin: Troubles I've Seen |last=Kahlenberg |first=Richard D. |work=Washington Monthly |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n4_v29/ai_19279952 |accessdate=June 12, 2008 |year=1997 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005121547/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n4_v29/ai_19279952 |archivedate=October 5, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wofford had been promoting Gandhism to Southern blacks since the early 1950s.&lt;ref name="mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu"/&gt; 

King had initially known little about [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] and rarely used the term "nonviolence" during his early years of activism in the early 1950s. King initially believed in and practiced self-defense, even obtaining guns in his household as a means of defense against possible attackers. The pacifists guided King by showing him the alternative of nonviolent resistance, arguing that this would be a better means to accomplish his goals of civil rights than self-defense. King then vowed to no longer personally use arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Enger|first=Mark and Paul|title=When Martin Luther King Jr. gave up his guns|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/01/20/when_martin_luther_king_jr_gave_up_his_guns_partner/|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| page= 217| last=Bennett | first=Scott H.| title=Radical Pacifism: The War Resisters League and Gandhian Nonviolence in America, 19151963 | publisher=Syracuse University Press| year=2003| isbn=0-8156-3003-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the boycott, King wrote ''[[Stride Toward Freedom]]'', which included the chapter ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20150514151301/http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/primarydocuments/Vol4/1-Sept-1958_MyPilgrimageToNonviolence.pdf Pilgrimage to Nonviolence].'' King outlined his understanding of nonviolence, which seeks to win an opponent to friendship, rather than to humiliate or defeat him. The chapter draws from an address by Wofford, with Rustin and [[Stanley Levison]] also providing guidance and ghostwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_stride_toward_freedom_the_montgomery_story_1958/|title=Stride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story (1958)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King was inspired by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and his success with nonviolent activism, and as a theology student, King described Gandhi as being one of the "individuals who greatly reveal the working of the Spirit of God".&lt;ref&gt;[http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_gandhi_mohandas_karamchand_1869_1948/ Gandhi, Mohandas Karamchand (1869-1948)], King Encyclopedia, Stanford University&lt;/ref&gt; King had "for a long time&amp;nbsp;... wanted to take a trip to India."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King Jr. |first=Martin Luther |author2=Clayborne Carson |title=The Papers of Martin Luther King Jr., Volume V: Threshold of a New Decade, January 1959&amp;nbsp; December 1960 |publisher=University of California Press |year=2005 |page=231 |url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/primarydocuments/Vol5/July1959_MyTriptotheLandofGandhi.pdf |isbn=0-520-24239-4 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615084051/http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/primarydocuments/Vol5/July1959_MyTriptotheLandofGandhi.pdf |archivedate=June 15, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With assistance from Harris Wofford, the [[American Friends Service Committee]], and other supporters, he was able to fund the journey in April 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_kings_trip_to_india/|title=India Trip (1959)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|King|1992|p=13}} The trip to India affected King, deepening his understanding of [[nonviolent resistance]] and his commitment to America's struggle for civil rights. In a radio address made during his final evening in India, King reflected, "Since being in India, I am more convinced than ever before that the method of nonviolent resistance is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for justice and human dignity."

King's admiration of Gandhi's nonviolence did not diminish in later years. He went so far as to hold up his example when receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, hailing the "successful precedent" of using nonviolence "in a magnificent way by Mohandas K. Gandhi to challenge the might of the British Empire&amp;nbsp;... He struggled only with the weapons of truth, soul force, non-injury and courage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nobel Lecture by MLK|date=December 11, 1964|author= Martin Luther King|page=12|url=http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/nobel-lecture-mlk|publisher=The King Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influence for King's nonviolent method was [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s essay ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|On Civil Disobedience]]'' and its theme of refusing to cooperate with an evil system.&lt;ref&gt;King, M. L. Morehouse College (Chapter 2 of The Autobiography of Martin Luther King Jr.)&lt;/ref&gt; He also was greatly influenced by the works of Protestant theologians [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and Paul Tillich,&lt;ref&gt;Reinhold Niebuhr and Contemporary Politics: God and Power&lt;/ref&gt; and said that [[Walter Rauschenbusch]]'s ''Christianity and the Social Crisis'' left an "indelible imprint" on his thinking by giving him a theological grounding for his social concerns.&lt;ref name="Ansbro 1982 p. 163"&gt;{{cite book | last=Ansbro | first=J.J. | title=Martin Luther King, Jr: Nonviolent Strategies and Tactics for Social Change | publisher=Madison Books | year=1982 | isbn=978-1-56833-169-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hm3ocS-jg8YC&amp;pg=PA163 | page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baldwin Burrow Fairclough 2013 p. 133"&gt;{{cite book | last=Baldwin | first=L.V. | last2=Burrow | first2=R. | last3=Fairclough | first3=A. | title=The Domestication of Martin Luther King Jr.: Clarence B.

Even after renouncing his personal use of guns, King had a complex relationship with the phenomenon of self-defense in the movement. He publicly discouraged it as a widespread practice, but acknowledged that it was sometimes necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/nonviolence-the-only-road-to-freedom/|title=Nonviolence: The Only Road to Freedom&amp;nbsp; Teaching American History|work=teachingamericanhistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his career King was frequently protected by other civil rights activists who carried arms, such as [[Colonel Stone Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2012/01/birmingham_civil_rights_activi.html|title=Birmingham civil rights activist Colonel Stone Johnson has died (slideshow)|work=AL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Augustine Movement|Robert Hayling]], and the [[Deacons for Defense and Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prospect.org/article/armed-resistance-civil-rights-movement-charles-e-cobb-and-danielle-l-mcguire-forgotten|title=Armed Resistance in the Civil Rights Movement: Charles E.

===Politics===
As the leader of the SCLC, King maintained a policy of not publicly endorsing a U.S. political party or candidate: "I feel someone must remain in the position of non-alignment, so that he can look objectively at both parties and be the conscience of bothnot the servant or master of either."&lt;ref name="Oates1993"&gt;{{cite book|first=Stephen B.|last=Oates|title=Let the Trumpet Sound: A Life of Martin Luther King, Jr|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=85fOOMQaNaQC&amp;pg=PA159|date=December 13, 1993|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-092473-7|page=159}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In a 1958 interview, he expressed his view that neither party was perfect, saying, "I don't think the Republican party is a party full of the almighty God nor is the Democratic party. They both have weaknesses&amp;nbsp;... And I'm not inextricably bound to either party."&lt;ref name="King-Carson2000p364"&gt;{{cite book|first=Martin Luther|last=King Jr.|editor1-first=Clayborne|editor1-last=Carson|editor2-first=Peter|editor2-last=Holloran|editor3-first=Ralph|editor3-last=Luker|editor4-first=Penny A.|editor4-last=Russell|title=The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr: Symbol of the Movement, January 1957&amp;nbsp; December 1958|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qW-NYdIefPgC&amp;pg=PA364|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-22231-1|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;
King did praise Democratic Senator [[Paul Douglas]] of Illinois as being the "greatest of all senators" because of his fierce advocacy for civil rights causes over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merriner|first1=James L.|title=Illinois' liberal giant, Paul Douglas|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-03-09/entertainment/0303080081_1_illinois-gov-paul-douglas-liberal/2|accessdate=May 17, 2015|publisher=''[[Chicago Tribune]]''|date=March 9, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King critiqued both parties' performance on promoting racial equality: {{Quote|Actually, the Negro has been betrayed by both the Republican and the Democratic party. The Democrats have betrayed him by capitulating to the whims and caprices of the Southern Dixiecrats. The Republicans have betrayed him by capitulating to the blatant hypocrisy of reactionary right wing northern Republicans. And this coalition of southern Dixiecrats and right wing reactionary northern Republicans defeats every bill and every move towards liberal legislation in the area of civil rights.&lt;ref name="King-Carson2000p84"&gt;{{cite book|first=Martin Luther|last=King Jr.|editor1-first=Clayborne|editor1-last=Carson|editor2-first=Peter|editor2-last=Holloran|editor3-first=Ralph|editor3-last=Luker|editor4-first=Penny A.|editor4-last=Russell|title=The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr: Symbol of the Movement, January 1957&amp;nbsp; December 1958|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qW-NYdIefPgC&amp;pg=PA84|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-22231-1|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although King never publicly supported a political party or candidate for president, in a letter to a civil rights supporter in October 1956 he said that he was undecided as to whether he would vote for [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] or [[Dwight Eisenhower]], but that "In the past I always voted the Democratic ticket."&lt;ref name="King-Carson1992p384"&gt;{{cite book|first=Martin Luther|last=King Jr.|editor1-first=Clayborne|editor1-last=Carson|editor2-first=Peter|editor2-last=Holloran|editor3-first=Ralph|editor3-last=Luker|editor4-first=Penny A.|editor4-last=Russell|title=The papers of Martin Luther King Jr.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ysIWgsSr9AC&amp;pg=PA384|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-07951-9|page=384}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In his autobiography, King says that in 1960 he privately voted for Democratic candidate [[John F. Kennedy]]: "I felt that Kennedy would make the best president. I never came out with an endorsement. My father did, but I never made one." King adds that he likely would have made an exception to his non-endorsement policy for a second Kennedy term, saying "Had President Kennedy lived, I would probably have endorsed him in 1964."&lt;ref name="King-Carson1998p187"&gt;{{cite book|first=Martin Luther|last=King Jr.|first2=Clayborne|last2=Carson|title=The Autobiography of Martin Luther King Jr. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pynSnGuC964C&amp;pg=PT187|year=1998|publisher=Hachette Digital|isbn=978-0-446-52412-4|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, King urged his supporters "and all people of goodwill" to vote against Republican Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] for president, saying that his election "would be a tragedy, and certainly suicidal almost, for the nation and the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJyWWM9OHKA|title=Mr. Conservative: Barry Goldwater's Opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1964|date=September 18, 2006|accessdate=May 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King supported the ideals of democratic socialism, although he was reluctant to speak directly of this support due to the anti-communist sentiment being projected throughout the [[United States]] at the time, and the association of socialism with communism. King believed that capitalism could not adequately provide the basic necessities of many American people, particularly the African-American community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hendricks Jr.|first=Obery M.|title=The Uncompromising Anti-Capitalism of Martin Luther King Jr.|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/obery-m-hendricks-jr-phd/the-uncompromising-anti-capitalism-of-martin-luther-king-jr_b_4629609.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compensation===
{{See also|Reparations for slavery debate in the United States}}
King stated that black Americans, as well as other disadvantaged Americans, should be compensated for historical wrongs. In an interview conducted for ''[[Playboy]]'' in 1965, he said that granting black Americans only equality could not realistically close the economic gap between them and whites. King said that he did not seek a full restitution of wages lost to slavery, which he believed impossible, but proposed a government compensatory program of $50&amp;nbsp;billion over ten years to all disadvantaged groups.{{sfn|Washington|1991|p=366}}

He posited that "the money spent would be more than amply justified by the benefits that would accrue to the nation through a spectacular decline in school dropouts, family breakups, crime rates, illegitimacy, swollen relief rolls, rioting and other social evils."{{sfn|Washington|1991|pp=36567}} He presented this idea as an application of the [[common law]] regarding settlement of unpaid labor, but clarified that he felt that the money should not be spent exclusively on blacks. He stated, "It should benefit the disadvantaged of ''all'' races."{{sfn|Washington|1991|pp=36768}}

===Family planning===
On being awarded the [[Planned Parenthood Federation of America]]'s [[Margaret Sanger Awards|Margaret Sanger Award]] on [[Sermons and speeches of Martin Luther King Jr.#cite note-8|May 5, 1966]], King said:

{{quote|Recently, the press has been filled with reports of sightings of [[flying saucers]].

They would also observe that we spend millions to prevent death by [[disease]] and other causes. Finally they would observe that we spend paltry sums for [[population planning]], even though its [[Population growth|spontaneous growth]] is an urgent threat to life on our planet. Our visitors from outer space could be forgiven if they reported home that our planet is inhabited by a race of insane men whose future is bleak and uncertain.&lt;br /&gt;There is no human circumstance more tragic than the persisting existence of a harmful condition for which a remedy is readily available.

===FBI surveillance and wiretapping===
FBI director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] personally ordered surveillance of King, with the intent to undermine his power as a civil rights leader.&lt;ref name="MED08"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Honey2007ch4&gt;{{cite book|last=Honey|first=Michael K.|title=Going down Jericho Road the Memphis strike, Martin Luther King's last campaign|year=2007|publisher=Norton|isbn=978-0-393-04339-6|edition=1|chapter=Standing at the Crossroads|quote=Hoover developed around-the-clock surveillance campaign aimed at destroying King.}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[Church Committee]], a 1975 investigation by the [[U.S. Congress]], "From December 1963 until his death in 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. was the target of an intensive campaign by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to 'neutralize' him as an effective civil rights leader."&lt;ref name=Church /&gt;

In the fall of 1963, the FBI received authorization from Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]] to proceed with wiretapping of King's phone lines.&lt;ref name="the atlantic"&gt;{{cite news | title= The FBI and Martin Luther King | last= Garrow | first =David J.| authorlink =David Garrow |date=JulyAugust 2002|work=The Atlantic Monthly |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200207/garrow}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau informed President [[John F. Kennedy]]. He and his brother unsuccessfully tried to persuade King to dissociate himself from [[Stanley Levison]], a New York lawyer who had been involved with Communist Party USA.&lt;ref name=right /&gt;{{sfn|Kotz|2005}} Although Robert Kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of King's telephone lines "on a trial basis, for a month or so",{{sfn|Herst|2007|p=372}} Hoover extended the clearance so his men were "unshackled" to look for evidence in any areas of King's life they deemed worthy.{{sfn|Herst|2007|pp=37274}} 

The Bureau placed wiretaps on the home and office phone lines of Levison and King, and bugged King's rooms in hotels as he traveled across the country.&lt;ref name=right&gt;{{cite news|title=JFK and RFK Were Right to Wiretap MLK |last=Ryskind |first=Allan H. |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3827/is_200602/ai_n17173432/pg_2 |accessdate=August 27, 2008 |work=Human Events |date=February 27, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004205959/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3827/is_200602/ai_n17173432/pg_2 |archivedate=October 4, 2008 |df= }}

In 1967, Hoover listed the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]] as a black nationalist hate group, with the instructions: "No opportunity should be missed to exploit through counterintelligence techniques the organizational and personal conflicts of the leaderships of the groups&amp;nbsp;... to insure the targeted group is disrupted, ridiculed, or discredited."&lt;ref name=Honey2007ch4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=War at Home: Covert Action Against U.S. Activists and What We Can Do About It |last=Glick |first=Brian |year=1989 |publisher=South End Press |isbn=978-0-89608-349-3 |page=77 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=M4uvwy_C3egC&amp;pg=PA77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NSA monitoring of King's communications===
In a secret operation code-named "[[Project MINARET|Minaret]]", the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) monitored the communications of leading Americans, including King, who criticized the U.S. war in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;The Guardian, September 26, 2013, "Declassified NSA Files Show Agency Spied on Muhammad Ali and MLK Operation Minaret Set Up in 1960s to Monitor Anti-Vietnam Critics, Branded 'Disreputable If Not Outright Illegal' by NSA Itself," [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/nsa-surveillance-anti-vietnam-muhammad-ali-mlk The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt; A review by the NSA itself concluded that Minaret was "disreputable if not outright illegal."&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

===Allegations of communism===
For years, Hoover had been suspicious about potential influence of communists in social movements such as labor unions and civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= To See the Promised Land: The Faith Pilgrimage of Martin Luther King, Jr|pages=2467|last= Downing|first= Frederick L.|publisher= Mercer University Press| year= 1986| isbn =0-86554-207-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Hoover directed the FBI to track King in 1957, and the SCLC as it was established (it did not have a full-time executive director until 1960).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; The investigations were largely superficial until 1962, when the FBI learned that one of King's most trusted advisers was New York City lawyer Stanley Levison.{{sfn|Kotz|2005|p=233}}

The FBI feared Levison was working as an "agent of influence" over King, in spite of its own reports in 1963 that Levison had left the Party and was no longer associated in business dealings with them.{{sfn|Kotz|2005|pp=7074}} Another King lieutenant, [[Hunter Pitts O'Dell]], was also linked to the Communist Party by sworn testimony before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Woods | first= Jeff|page=126|year=2004|publisher=LSU Press|isbn= 0-8071-2926-7|title= Black Struggle, Red Scare: Segregation and Anti-communism in the South, 19481968}} See also: {{cite book| page= 87| title= The Real J. Edgar Hoover: For the Record | last =Wannall|first=Ray|isbn=1-56311-553-0|year=2000|publisher= Turner Publishing}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
However, by 1976 the FBI had acknowledged that it had not obtained any evidence that King himself or the SCLC were actually involved with any communist organizations.&lt;ref name=Church&gt;{{citation|last=Church|first= Frank|authorlink= Frank Church|title= Church Committee Book III| work =Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Case Study| publisher= [[Church Committee]]| date=April 23, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his part, King adamantly denied having any connections to communism. In a 1965 ''Playboy'' interview, he stated  that "there are as many Communists in this freedom movement as there are Eskimos in Florida."{{sfn|Washington|1991|p=362}} He argued that Hoover was "following the path of appeasement of political powers in the South" and that his concern for communist infiltration of the civil rights movement was meant to "aid and abet the salacious claims of southern racists and the extreme right-wing elements."&lt;ref name=Church /&gt;
Hoover did not believe King's pledge of innocence and replied by saying that King was "the most notorious liar in the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Martin Luther King Jr.: A Biography |last=Bruns |first=Roger |page=67 |isbn=0-313-33686-5 | publisher =Greenwood Publishing |year= 2006}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
After King gave his "I Have A Dream" speech during the March on Washington on August 28, 1963, the FBI described King as "the most dangerous and effective Negro leader in the country."&lt;ref name=track /&gt; It alleged that he was "knowingly, willingly and regularly cooperating with and taking guidance from communists."{{sfn|Kotz|2005|p=83}}

The attempt to prove that King was a communist was related to the feeling of many segregationists that blacks in the South were happy with their lot but had been stirred up by "communists" and "outside agitators."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Democratic Individuality: A Theory of Moral Progress |page=435 |last=Gilbert |first=Alan |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1990 |isbn=0-521-38709-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the 1950s and '60s civil rights movement arose from activism within the black community dating back to before World War I. King said that "the Negro revolution is a genuine revolution, born from the same womb that produces all massive social upheavalsthe womb of intolerable conditions and unendurable situations."{{sfn|Washington|1991|p=363}}

===CIA surveillance===

CIA files declassified in 2017 revealed that the agency was investigating possible links between King and Communism after a Washington Post article dated November 4, 1964 claimed he was invited to the Soviet Union and that Ralph Abernathy, spokesman for subject, refused to comment on the source of the invitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/docid-32397512.pdf |title=Martin Luther King |author=CIA |date=November 5, 1967 |accessdate=February 13, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adultery===
[[File:MLK and Malcolm X USNWR cropped.jpg|thumb|King and [[Malcolm X]], March 26, 1964.]]
Having concluded that King was dangerous due to communist infiltration, the FBI attempted to discredit King through revelations regarding his private life. FBI surveillance of King, some of it since made public, attempted to demonstrate that he also engaged in numerous extramarital affairs.&lt;ref name=track/&gt; [[Lyndon Johnson]] once said that King was a "hypocritical preacher."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=L.B.J., Hoover and Domestic Spying |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,912799-2,00.html |work=Time |last=Sidey |first=Hugh |accessdate=June 14, 2008 |date=February 10, 1975 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921122310/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C912799-2%2C00.html |archivedate=September 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1989 autobiography ''[[And the Walls Came Tumbling Down]]'', Ralph Abernathy stated that King had a "weakness for women", although they "all understood and believed in the biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage. It was just that he had a particularly difficult time with that temptation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=And the walls came tumbling down: an autobiography |last=Abernathy |first=Ralph |year=1989 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=978-0-06-016192-7 |page=471 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JFx2AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22all+understood+and+believed+in+the+biblical+prohibition+against+sex+outside+of+marriage.+It+was+just+that+he+had+a+particularly+difficult+time+with+that+temptation%22&amp;dq=%22all+understood+and+believed+in+the+biblical+prohibition+against+sex+outside+of+marriage.+It+was+just+that+he+had+a+particularly+difficult+time+with+that+temptation%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later interview, Abernathy said that he only wrote the term "womanizing", that he did not specifically say King had [[extramarital sex]] and that the infidelities King had were [[emotional affair|emotional]] rather than sexual.&lt;ref name=abertappva&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.booknotes.org/Transcript/index_print.asp?ProgramID=1442 | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071211111242/http://www.booknotes.org/Transcript/index_print.asp?ProgramID=1442 | archivedate=December 11, 2007 | title=And the Walls Came Tumbling Down | first=Ralph David |last=Abernathy |publisher=Booknotes |date=October 29, 1989 | accessdate=June 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Abernathy criticized the media for sensationalizing the statements he wrote about King's affairs,&lt;ref name=abertappva /&gt; such as the allegation that he admitted in his book that King had a sexual affair the night before he was assassinated.&lt;ref name=abertappva /&gt; In his original wording, Abernathy had claimed he saw King coming out of his room with a lady when he awoke the next morning and later claimed that "he may have been in there discussing and debating and trying to get her to go along with the movement, I don't know."&lt;ref name=abertappva /&gt;

In his 1986 book ''Bearing the Cross'', David Garrow wrote about a number of extramarital affairs, including one woman King saw almost daily. According to Garrow, "that relationship&amp;nbsp;... increasingly became the emotional centerpiece of King's life, but it did not eliminate the incidental couplings&amp;nbsp;... of King's travels." He alleged that King explained his extramarital affairs as "a form of anxiety reduction." Garrow asserted that King's supposed promiscuity caused him "painful and at times overwhelming guilt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title =Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference|year=1986|pages=3756 | publisher=William Morrow &amp; Co}}&lt;/ref&gt; King's wife Coretta appeared to have accepted his affairs with equanimity, saying once that "all that other business just doesn't have a place in the very high level relationship we enjoyed."{{sfn|Frady|2002|p=67}} Shortly after ''Bearing the Cross'' was released, civil rights author [[Howell Raines]] gave the book a positive review but opined that Garrow's allegations about King's sex life were "sensational" and stated that Garrow was "amassing facts rather than analyzing them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/02/07/nnp/garrow.html|title=Driven to Martyrdom|author=Raines, Howell |work=The New York Times|date=November 30, 1986|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI distributed reports regarding such affairs to the executive branch, friendly reporters, potential coalition partners and funding sources of the SCLC, and King's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Conspiracy Encyclopedia]] |last= Burnett | first =Thom |isbn=1-84340-287-4 |publisher=Collins &amp; Brown |year= 2005 |page= 58}}

The letter was accompanied by a tape recordingexcerpted from FBI wiretapsof several of King's extramarital liaisons.{{sfn|Frady|2002|pp=158159}} King interpreted this package as an attempt to drive him to suicide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page= 466 |last= Wilson |first= Sondra K. | publisher =Oxford University Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-19-511633-X |title=In Search of Democracy: The NAACP Writings of James Weldon Johnson, Walter White, and Roy Wilkins (19201977)}}
&lt;/ref&gt; although William Sullivan, head of the Domestic Intelligence Division at the time, argued that it may have only been intended to "convince Dr. King to resign from the SCLC."&lt;ref name=Church /&gt; King refused to give in to the FBI's threats.&lt;ref name=track/&gt;

In 1977, [[United States District Judge|Judge]] [[John Lewis Smith Jr.]] ordered all known copies of the recorded audiotapes and written transcripts resulting from the FBI's electronic surveillance of King between 1963 and 1968 to be held in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] and sealed from public access until 2027.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Documenting the Struggle for Racial Equality in the Decade of the Sixties | publisher=The National Archives and Records Administration | url =https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1997/summer/equality-in-the-sixties.html#f3 |date=Summer 1997 | last=Phillips | first=Geraldine N. | work=Prologue | accessdate=June 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police observation during the assassination===
A fire station was located across from the Lorraine Motel, next to the boarding house in which James Earl Ray was staying.

&lt;/ref&gt;
The antagonism between King and the FBI, the lack of an [[all points bulletin]] to find the killer, and the police presence nearby led to speculation that the FBI was involved in the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | pages= 4089 |title= Conspiracy Theories in American History: An Encyclopedia |last=Knight |first=Peter |isbn=1-57607-812-4 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] was posthumously awarded to King by President [[Jimmy Carter]]. The citation read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Martin Luther King Jr. was the conscience of his generation. He gazed upon the great wall of segregation and saw that the power of love could bring it down. From the pain and exhaustion of his fight to fulfill the promises of our founding fathers for our humblest citizens, he wrung his eloquent statement of his dream for America. He made our nation stronger because he made it better. His dream sustains us yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=7784 |title=Presidential Medal of Freedom Remarks on Presenting the Medal to Dr. Jonas E.

===Five-dollar bill===
On April 20, 2016, [[Treasury Secretary]] [[Jacob Lew]] announced that the $5, $10, and $20 bills would all undergo redesign prior to 2020. Lew said that while Lincoln would remain on the obverse of the $5 bill, the reverse would be redesigned to depict various historical events that had occurred at the Lincoln Memorial. Among the planned designs are images from King's "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech and the 1939 concert by opera singer [[Marian Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/04/20/report-lew-considered-anthony-10-bill/83274530/ |title=Anti-slavery activist Harriet Tubman to replace Jackson on the front of the $20 bill |publisher=USAToday.com |date=April 21, 2016 |access-date=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
