Following his time at [[LSU Tigers men's basketball|Louisiana State University]], O'Neal was drafted by the [[Orlando Magic]] with the [[List of first overall NBA draft picks|first overall pick]] in the [[1992 NBA draft]]. He quickly became one of the best [[Center (basketball)|centers]] in the league, winning [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] in [[199293 NBA season|199293]] and leading his team to the [[1995 NBA Finals]]. After four years with the Magic, O'Neal signed as a [[free agent]] with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. They won [[Three-peat|three consecutive championships]] in [[2000 NBA Finals|2000]], [[2001 NBA Finals|2001]], and [[2002 NBA Finals|2002]]. Amid [[ShaqKobe feud|tension between O'Neal and Kobe Bryant]], O'Neal was traded to the [[Miami Heat]] in [[20042005 NBA season|2004]], and his fourth NBA championship followed in [[2006 NBA Finals|2006]]. Midway through the 20072008 season he was traded to the [[Phoenix Suns]].

==Early life==
[[File:Shaquille O'Neal - Cole High School 1989.jpg|thumb|left|upright|O'Neal playing for the Cole High School varsity basketball team in 198889.]]
O'Neal was born on March 6, 1972, in [[Newark, New Jersey]], to Lucille O'Neal and Joe Toney, who played high school basketball (he was an All-State guard) and was offered a basketball scholarship to play at [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|Seton Hall]]. Toney struggled with [[drug addiction]] and was imprisoned for drug possession when O'Neal was an infant. Upon his release, he did not resume a place in O'Neal's life and instead agreed to relinquish his parental rights to O'Neal's stepfather, Phillip A. Harrison, a career [[United States Army|Army]] sergeant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.filmreference.com/film/16/Shaquille-O-Neal.html|title=Shaquille O'Neal Biography (1972) |work= filmreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LAT Plaschke"/&gt; O'Neal remained estranged from his biological father for decades; O'Neal had not spoken with Toney or expressed an interest in establishing a relationship.&lt;ref name="LAT Plaschke"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jun/11/sports/sp-plaschke11|title='Biological Didn't Bother'| first= Bill| last= Plaschke|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 12, 2002|accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his 1994 [[Hip hop music|rap]] album, ''Shaq Fu: The Return'', O'Neal voiced his feelings of disdain for Toney in the song "[[Biological Didn't Bother]]", dismissing him with the line "Phil is my father." However, O'Neal's feelings toward Toney mellowed in the years following Harrison's death in 2013, and the two met for the first time in March 2016, with O'Neal telling him, "I dont hate you. I had a good life. I had Phil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theundefeated.com/features/shaq-to-biological-father-i-dont-hate-you/ |title=Shaq to biological father: I dont hate you |first=Mike |last=Wise |work=The Undefeated |publisher=ESPN |date= September 9, 2016 |accessdate=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Neal credits the [[Boys and Girls Club of America]] in Newark with giving him a safe place to play and keeping him off the streets. "It gave me something to do," he said. "I'd just go there to shoot. I didn't even play on a team."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan |first=Michael |title=Where They Gave Me A Chance |work=Parade |url=http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2000/edition_02-13-2000/Boys_And_Girls_Clubs |date=February 13, 2000 |accessdate=March 21, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060628074957/http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2000/edition_02-13-2000/Boys_And_Girls_Clubs |archivedate= June 28, 2006 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his stepfather's career in the military, the family left Newark, moving to [[military bases]] in [[Germany]] and [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/article/122380/Shaq_sets_bar_high_for_Young_Lives__BIG_Stories_campaign/ |title=Shaq Sets Bar High for Young Lives, BIG Stories Campaign| publisher= United States Army |website=Army.mil |date= |accessdate=February 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Robert G. Cole Junior-Senior High School|Robert G. Cole High School]] in [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]], O'Neal led his team to a 681 record over two years and helped the team win the state championship during his senior year.&lt;ref name="key moments"&gt;{{cite web |title=Key Moments In Shaquille O'neal History |work= [[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]] |url= http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2004-07-11/sports/0407110264_1_lucille-o-neal-shaq-attack-shaquille-rashaun-o-neal |date= July 11, 2004|accessdate=January 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His 791 rebounds during the 1989 season remains a state record for a player in any classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Bill| last= McMurray| title= Bill McMurray's Texas High School All-Time Sports Record Book| edition= 6th| publisher= Four Star Publications| year= | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Neal's tendency to make [[hook shot]]s earned comparisons to [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], inspiring him to wear the same jersey number as Abdul-Jabbar, ''33''. However, his high school team did not have a ''33'' jersey, so O'Neal chose to wear ''32'' before college.&lt;ref name= number&gt;{{cite news| url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-08-25/sports/9208250132_1_shaq-catledge-oneal |title= Shaquille Shows Class In Switching To No. 32| first= Brian | last= Schmitz| work= [[Orlando Sentinel]] | date= August 25, 1992| access-date= July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had first met [[Dale Brown (basketball)|Dale Brown]], [[LSU Tigers basketball|LSU's men's basketball coach]], years earlier in Europe.

With the tandem of O'Neal and teenage superstar [[Kobe Bryant]], expectations for the Lakers increased.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 20012002 season, O'Neal told friends that he did not want another season of limping and being in virtually constant pain from his big right toe. His trademark mobility and explosion had been often absent. The corrective options ranged from [[reconstructive surgery]] on the toe to rehabilitation exercises with more shoe inserts and [[inflammation|anti-inflammation]] medication. O'Neal was already wary of the long-term damage his frequent consumption of these medications might have. He did not want to rush a decision with his career potentially at risk.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;

O'Neal missed the first 12 games of the [[200203 NBA season|20022003 season]] recovering from toe surgery.&lt;ref name=nbabio&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nba.com/playerfile/shaquille_oneal/bio.html | title = Shaquille O'Neal Bio Page | accessdate =June 1, 2011 | website= NBA.com | quote = sat out the first 12 games of the season (Oct.&amp;nbsp;29-Nov. 22) on the Injured List recovering from off-season foot surgery}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sidelined with [[hallux rigidus]], a degenerative arthritis in his toe.&lt;ref name=oneal2011_p155&gt;[[#oneal2011|O'Neal, MacMullan 2011]], p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; He waited the whole summer until just before training camp for the surgery and explained, "I got hurt on company time, so Ill heal on company time."&lt;ref name=ventre&gt;{{cite news | first = Mark | last = Ventre | title = It looks like Shaq's reshuffling Heat house | date = December 12, 2005 | url = http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/10439131/ | work=NBCSports.com | accessdate =October 13, 2010 | quote = Remember, this is the same Shaquille O'Neal who, while with the Lakers, once waited all summer to have his injured toe operated on, then did so just before training camp and explained, "I got hurt on company time, so Ill heal on company time."}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Neal debated whether to have a more invasive surgery that would have kept him out an additional three months, but he opted against the more involved procedure.&lt;ref name=oneal2011_p155/&gt; The Lakers started the season with a record of 1119.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/2003_games.html | title = 200203 Los Angeles Lakers Schedule and Results | accessdate =October 13, 2010 | work=basketball-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the season, the Lakers had fallen to the fifth seed and failed to reach the Finals in 2003.

For the [[200304 Los Angeles Lakers season|2003-04 season]], the team made a concerted off-season effort to improve its roster. They sought the free-agent services of forward [[Karl Malone]] and aging guard [[Gary Payton]], but due to [[NBA Salary Cap|salary cap]] restrictions, could not offer either one nearly as much money as they could have made with some other teams. O'Neal assisted in the recruitment efforts and personally persuaded both men to join the squad. Ultimately, both signed, each forgoing larger salaries in favor of a chance to win an NBA championship, which neither had accomplished in his career (and which neither would achieve with the Lakers). At the beginning of the [[200304 NBA season|200304 season]], O'Neal wanted a contract extension with a pay raise on his remaining three years for $30&amp;nbsp;million. The Lakers had hoped O'Neal would take less money due to his age, physical conditioning, and games missed due to injuries. During a preseason game, O'Neal had yelled at Lakers owner [[Jerry Buss]], "Pay me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lazenby |first=Roland |authorlink=Roland Lazenby |title=The Show: The Inside Story of the Spectacular Los Angeles Lakers in the Words of Those Who Lived It |page=421|year=2006 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Professional]] |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-07-143034-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HiH8z6EmSIsC&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;vq=balloons&amp;dq=the%20show%20roland%20lazenby&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |ref=lazenby2006 |accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There had been increasing [[ShaqKobe feud|tension between O'Neal and Bryant]]. The feud climaxed during training camp prior to the 20032004 season when Bryant, in an interview with ESPN journalist [[Jim Gray (sportscaster)|Jim Gray]], criticized O'Neal for being out of shape, a poor leader, and putting his salary demands over the best interest of the Lakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1648431|title=Kobe critical of Shaq's leadership|publisher=ESPN|first= Kobe| last= Bryant| interviewer= Jim Gray| date=October 28, 2003 |accessdate= December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lakers made the playoffs in 2004 and lost to the [[Detroit Pistons]] in the [[2004 NBA Finals]]. Lakers assistant coach [[Tex Winter]] said, "Shaq defeated himself against Detroit. He played way too passively. He had one big game ... He's always interested in being a scorer, but he hasn't had nearly enough concentration on defense and rebounding."&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt; After the series, O'Neal was angered by comments made by Lakers general manager [[Mitch Kupchak]] regarding O'Neal's future with the club, as well as by the departure of Lakers coach [[Phil Jackson]] at the request of Buss. O'Neal made comments indicating that he felt the team's decisions were centered on a desire to appease Bryant to the exclusion of all other concerns, and O'Neal promptly demanded a trade. Kupchak wanted the [[Dallas Mavericks]]' [[Dirk Nowitzki]] in return but Mavericks owner [[Mark Cuban]] refused to let his 7-footer go. However, Miami showed interest, and eventually the two clubs agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/5397513/|website= MSNBC.com | publisher=NBC|title=Shaq happy, Lakers in shock after trade|date=July 15, 2004|accessdate=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winter said, "[O'Neal] left because he couldn't get what he wanteda huge pay raise. There was no way ownership could give him what he wanted. Shaq's demands held the franchise hostage, and the way he went about it didn't please the owner too much."&lt;ref&gt;[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miami Heat (20042008)===
[[File:Shaquille O'Neal1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|O'Neal with Miami in 2007]]

On July 14, 2004, O'Neal was traded to the [[Miami Heat]] for [[Caron Butler]], [[Lamar Odom]], [[Brian Grant]], and a future first-round [[draft (sports)|draft]] choice (who would turn into [[Jordan Farmar]] in the [[2006 NBA draft|2006 draft]]). O'Neal reverted from (his Lakers jersey) number 34 to number 32, which he had worn while playing for the Magic. Upon signing with the Heat, O'Neal promised the fans that he would bring a championship to Miami. He claimed one of the main reasons for wanting to be traded to Miami was because of their up-and-coming star [[Dwyane Wade]], to whom he gave the nickname "Flash". With O'Neal on board, the new-look Heat surpassed expectations, claiming the best record in the Eastern Conference in 200405 with 59 wins. He played in 73 games, his most since 2001 season, averaged 22.9 points a game along with 10.4 rebounds and 2.3 blocks. Shaq also made his 12th consecutive All-Star Team, made the All-NBA 1st Team, and won the Eastern Conference player of the Month award for his performance in March. O'Neal also narrowly lost the [[200405 NBA season|200405]] [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP Award]] to [[Phoenix Suns]] guard [[Steve Nash]] in one of the closest votes in NBA history.&lt;ref name="mvp_vote_2005"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_2005.html | publisher=Basketball Reference | title = 200405 NBA Awards Voting | accessdate =June 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being hobbled by a deep thigh bruise, O'Neal led the Heat to the [[2005 NBA Playoffs#Conference finals|Eastern Conference Finals]] and a Game 7 against the defending champion [[Detroit Pistons]], losing by a narrow margin. Afterwards, O'Neal and others criticized Heat head coach [[Stan Van Gundy]] for not calling enough plays for O'Neal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In August 2005, O'Neal signed a 5-year-extension with the Heat for $100&amp;nbsp;million. Supporters applauded O'Neal's willingness to take what amounted to a pay cut and the Heat's decision to secure O'Neal's services for the long term. They contended that O'Neal was worth more than $20&amp;nbsp;million per year, particularly given that lesser players earned almost the same amount.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2122716 "Shaq makes long-term plans in Miami"].

In the second game of the [[200506 NBA season|200506 season]], O'Neal injured his right ankle and subsequently missed the following 18 games. Upon O'Neal's return, Van Gundy resigned, citing family reasons, and [[Pat Riley]] assumed head coach responsibilities.&lt;ref name=ventre/&gt; O'Neal later referred to Van Gundy as a "frontrunner" and a "master of panic."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=3953133 "Shaq rips Van Gundy for flop comment"]. Retrieved December 4, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics stated that Heat coach Riley correctly managed O'Neal during the rest of the season, limiting his minutes to a career low. Riley felt doing so would allow O'Neal to be healthier and fresher come playoff time. Although O'Neal averaged career lows (or near-lows) in points, rebounds, and blocks, he said in an interview "Stats don't matter. I care about winning, not stats. If I score 0 points and we win I'm happy. If I score 50, 60 points, break the records, and we lose, I'm pissed off. 'Cause I knew I did something wrong. I'll have a hell of a season if I win the championship and average 20 points a game."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shaqquotes.com Shaq Quotes]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109171713/http://www.shaqquotes.com/ |date=January 9, 2016 }}.

In the [[2006 NBA Playoffs]], the Heat first faced the younger [[Chicago Bulls]], and O'Neal delivered a dominating 27 point, 16 rebound and 5 blocks performance in game 1 followed by a 22-point effort in game 2 to help Miami take a 2-0 lead in the series.  Chicago would respond with two dominating performances at home to tie the series, but Miami would respond right back with a victory at home in game 5. Miami returned to Chicago and closed out the series in the 6th game, highlighted by another dominating performance by O'Neal who finished with 30 points and 20 rebounds. Miami advanced to face New Jersey, who won a surprising game 1 victory before the Heat won four straight to assure a rematch with Detroit. The Pistons had no answer for Wade throughout the series, while O'Neal delivered 21 points and 12 rebounds in game 3 followed by 27 points and 12 boards in game 4 to help Miami take a 3-2 series lead.  The Pistons would win game 5 in Detroit, and Wade would once again get injured, but the Heat held on to win game 6 with O'Neal scoring 28 points with 16 rebounds and 5 blocks to help Miami reach their first ever NBA Finals.&lt;ref name="Heat Playoffs Summary"&gt;[http://www.nba.com/heat/history/playoff_history_2006.html "Heat Playoff History 2006"].

In the Finals, the Heat were underdogs against the [[Dallas Mavericks]] led by [[Dirk Nowitzki]], and the Mavericks won the first two games at home in dominating fashion.  The Heat led by Wade and a balanced effort by O'Neal, [[Antoine Walker]] and [[Jason Williams (basketball, born 1975)|Jason Williams]] would go on to win all three of the next games at home, before closing out the series in Dallas to deliver the first NBA title for the franchise and O'Neal's fourth title.

==National team career==
While in college, O'Neal was considered for the [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Dream Team]] to fill the college spot, but it eventually went to future teammate [[Christian Laettner]].&lt;ref&gt;[[ESPN]] [http://espn.go.com/nba/player/bio/_/id/614/shaquille-oneal]&lt;/ref&gt; His national team career began in the [[1994 FIBA World Championship]] in which he was named [[FIBA World Cup MVP|MVP of the Tournament]]. While he led the [[United States men's national basketball team#Olympics|Dream Team II]] to the gold medal with an 80 record, O'Neal averaged 18 points and 8.5 rebounds and recorded two double-doubles. In four games, he scored more than 20 points. Before 2010, he was the last active American player to have a gold from the [[FIBA World Cup]].

He was one of two players (the other being [[Reggie Miller]]) from the 1994 roster to be also named to the [[1996 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Dream Team III]]. Due to more star-power, he rotated with [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] and [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] and started 3 games. He averaged 9.3 points and 5.3 rebounds with 8 total blocks. Again, a perfect 80 record landed him another gold medal at the [[Basketball at the 1996 Summer Olympics  Men's tournament|1996 Olympics]] in Atlanta. O'Neal was upset that coach [[Lenny Wilkens]] played Robinson more minutes in the final game; Wilkens previously explained to O'Neal that it would probably be Robinson's last Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;[[#oneal2011|O'Neal, MacMullan 2011]], p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his 1996 experience, he declined to play in international competition.

O'Neal's "[[drop step]]", (called the "Black Tornado" by O'Neal) in which he posted up a defender, turned around and, using his elbows for leverage, powered past him for a very high-percentage [[slam dunk]], proved an effective offensive weapon. In addition, O'Neal frequently used a right-handed [[Hook shot|jump hook]] shot to score near the basket. The ability to dunk contributed to his career field goal accuracy of .582, second only to [[Artis Gilmore]] as the highest field goal percentage of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/FGP_career.html |title=Career Leaders and Records for Field Goal Pct |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |accessdate=December 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He led the NBA in field goal percentage 10 times, breaking [[Wilt Chamberlain]]'s record of nine.&lt;ref name=nbabio/&gt;

Opposing teams often used up many fouls on O'Neal, reducing the playing time of their own big men. O'Neal's imposing physical presence inside the paint caused dramatic changes in many teams' offensive and defensive strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=280429024|title=Phoenix Suns vs. San Antonio Spurs - Recap - April 29, 2008|publisher=ESPN|date=April 29, 2008|accessdate=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Neal's primary weakness was his [[free throw]] shooting, with a career average of 52.7%. He once missed all 11 of his free throw attempts in a game against the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] on December 8, 2000, a record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Through the 20042005 season |url=http://www.nba.com/history/records/regular_freethrows.html |title=Regular Season Records: Free Throws |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=December 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Neal believes his free throw woes were a mental issue, as he often shot 80&amp;nbsp;percent in practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[#oneal2011|O'Neal, MacMullan 2011]], p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; In hope of exploiting O'Neal's poor foul shooting, opponents often committed intentional fouls against him, a tactic known as "[[Hack-a-Shaq]]". O'Neal was the third-ranked player all-time in free throws taken,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/FTA_career.html |title=Career Leaders and Records for Free Throw Attempts  |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |accessdate=December 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; having attempted 11,252 free-throws in 1,207 games up to and including the 201011 season. On December 25, 2008, O'Neal missed his 5,000th free throw, becoming the second player in NBA history to do so, along with Chamberlain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nba.com/games/20081225/SASPHX/recap.html |title=Mason's 3-pointer gives Spurs 9190 win over Suns |agency=Associated Press |date=December 25, 2008 |author=Bob Baum |publisher=nba.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Neal only made one three point shot during his entire career. He made the shot during the 199596 NBA season with the Orlando Magic. His career three point shot record is 1 for 22 (a 4.5% career percentage).

O'Neal was a capable defender, named three times to the All-NBA Second Defensive Team. His presence intimidated opposing players shooting near the basket, and he averaged 2.3 blocked shots per game over the course of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, Josh. (September 21, 2012).

==Media personality==
O'Neal called himself "''The Big Aristotle''" and "''Hobo Master''" for his composure and insights during interviews.

O'Neal was fined by the union for crossing the [[picketing (protest)|picket line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117782988.html?categoryid=18&amp;cs=1 |title=Admen strike back against SAG/AFTRA |work=Variety |author=Dave McNary |date=June 23, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/801470.stm |work=BBC News  |title=Sports stars break Hollywood strike |date=June 22, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2005 NBA playoffs, O'Neal compared his poor play to [[Erick Dampier]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2005/news/story?id=2059037|publisher=ESPN|title=Shaq: 'I've been playing like Erick Dampier'|date=May 13, 2005|accessdate=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Dallas Mavericks]] center who had failed to score a single point in one of their recent games. The quip inspired countless citations and references by announcers during those playoffs, though Dampier himself offered little response to the insult. The two would meet in the [[2006 NBA Finals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/finals2006/|publisher=ESPN|title=NBA.com: Finals 2006| year=2006|accessdate=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Neal was very vocal with the media, often making jabs at former Laker teammate Kobe Bryant. In the summer of 2005, when asked about Bryant, he responded, "I'm sorry, who?" and continued to pretend that he did not know who Bryant was until well into the 200506 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1187093/2/index.htm An A-to-Z remembrance of Shaq's careerbasketball and (mostly) otherwise]  Sports Illustrated, CNN&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Neal also appeared on television on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (he was initially picked to host the second episode of season 24 in 1998, but had to back down due to scheduling conflicts, being replaced by [[Kelsey Grammer]]); however, he did appear in two sketches during the episode) and in 2007 hosted ''Shaq's Big Challenge'', a reality show on ABC in which he challenged Florida kids to lose weight and stay in shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-08-02|title=Shaq's Big Challenge|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shaq%27s_Big_Challenge&amp;oldid=732614366|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Lakers faced the Heat on January 16, 2006, O'Neal and Bryant made headlines by engaging in handshakes and hugs before the game, an event that was believed to signify the end of the so-called "[[BryantO'Neal feud]]" that had festered since the center left Los Angeles. O'Neal was quoted as saying that he accepted the advice of NBA legend [[Bill Russell]] to make peace with Bryant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=260116013 |publisher=ESPN |title=Miami vs. Los Angeles  Recap |date=January 16, 2006 |agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on June 22, 2008, O'Neal [[Freestyle rap|freestyled]] a diss rap about Bryant in a New York club. While rapping, O'Neal blamed Bryant for his divorce from his wife Shaunie and claims to have received a [[vasectomy]], as part of a rhyme.

===Education===
O'Neal left LSU for the NBA after three years. However, he promised his mother he would eventually return to his studies and complete his [[bachelor's degree]]. He fulfilled that promise in 2000, earning his bachelor of arts in general studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytexanonline.com/sports/o-neal-to-get-degree-from-lsu-1.985348 |title=O'Neal to get degree from LSU |agency=Associated Press |date=August 6, 2004 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coach [[Phil Jackson]] let O'Neal miss a home game so he could attend graduation. At the ceremony, he told the crowd "now I can go and get a real job".
Subsequently, O'Neal earned an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] online through the [[University of Phoenix]] in 2005. In reference to his completion of his MBA degree, he stated: "It's just something to have on my resume for when I go back into reality. Someday I might have to put down a basketball and have a regular 9-to-5 like everybody else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8357843/ |title=The Big Executive?

===Law enforcement===
O'Neal maintained a high level of interest in the workings of police departments and became personally involved in law enforcement. O'Neal went through the [[Los Angeles County]] [[Sheriff]]'s Reserve Academy and became a reserve officer with the [[Los Angeles Port Police]]. He appeared in a commercial for [[ESPN]] in [[Miami Police Department|Miami Police]] garb climbing a tree to rescue [[LSU Tigers|LSU]]'s costumed mascot [[Mike the Tiger]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

On March 2, 2005, O'Neal was given an honorary [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Deputy Marshal]] title and named the spokesman for the Safe Surfin' Foundation; he served an honorary role on the task force of the same name, which tracks down [[sexual predator]]s who target children on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/basketball/nba/specials/playoffs/2005/05/25/shaq/index.html?cnn=yes |publisher=SI.com |title=Going undercover -Shaq helps task force track Internet sex predators|date=May 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
