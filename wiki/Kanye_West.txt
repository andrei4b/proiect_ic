'''Kanye Omari West''' ({{IPAc-en||k||n|j|e}}; born June 8, 1977) is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]] and fashion designer. He is one of the most popular rappers in the world, and one of the world's [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]]. West's contributions to music and fashion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Morwenna |last= Ferrier |title= The rise and rise of Kanye Wests influence on fashion  |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |date= April 1, 2018 |accessdate= June 5, 2018 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/31/kanye-west-rise-fashion-virgil-abloh-louis-vuitton}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with his publicized personal life made him a global figure in [[popular culture]].

Born in [[Atlanta]] and raised in [[Chicago]], West first became known as a producer for [[Roc-A-Fella Records]] in the early 2000s, [[Kanye West production discography|producing and co-producing hit single]]s for artists such as [[Jay-Z]] and [[Talib Kweli]]. Intent on pursuing a solo career as a [[rapping|rapper]], West released his debut album ''[[The College Dropout]]'' in 2004 to widespread critical and commercial success, and founded the record label [[GOOD Music]]. He went on to pursue a variety of styles on subsequent albums ''[[Late Registration]]'' (2005), ''[[Graduation (album)|Graduation]]'' (2007), and the polarizing ''[[808s &amp; Heartbreak]]'' (2008). In 2010, he released his fifth album ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]'' to rave reviews from critics, and followed with the collaborative album ''[[Watch the Throne]]'' (2011) with Jay-Z. West released his abrasive sixth album ''[[Yeezus]]'' to further critical praise in 2013, and his seventh album ''[[The Life of Pablo]]'' in 2016, noted for its fragmented musical style.

He is the founder and head of the creative content company [[DONDA]].

According to his mother, West was the only foreigner in his class, but settled in well and quickly picked up the language, although he has since forgotten most of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=West|first=Donda|title=Raising Kanye: Life Lessons from the Mother of a Hip-Hop Superstar|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2007|location=New York, NY|pages=8593|isbn=978-1-4165-4470-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about his grades in high school, West replied, "I got A's and B's.

West demonstrated an affinity for the arts at an early age; he began writing poetry when he was five years old.&lt;ref name=Chicago&gt;{{cite news|title=Kanye and His Mom Shared Special Bond|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-11-13/news/0711130488_1_chicago-state-university-degree-from-auburn-university-kanye-west|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=November 13, 2007|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother recalled that she first took notice of West's passion for drawing and music when he was in the third grade.&lt;ref&gt;West, Donda, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; West started rapping in the third grade and began making musical compositions in the seventh grade, eventually selling them to other artists.&lt;ref name=KanplicatedPg2&gt;{{cite web|author=Calloway, Sway|author2=Reid, Shaheem|title=Kanye West: Kanplicated|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/w/west_kanye/news_feature_022404/index2.jhtml|date=February 20, 2004|publisher=MTV|accessdate=April 21, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406021640/http://www.mtv.com/bands/w/west_kanye/news_feature_022404/index2.jhtml|archivedate=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age thirteen, West wrote a rap song called "Green Eggs and Ham" and began to persuade his mother to pay $25 an hour for time in a recording studio. It was a small, crude basement studio where a microphone hung from the ceiling by a wire clothes hanger. Although this wasn't what West's mother wanted, she nonetheless supported him.&lt;ref name="Chicago" /&gt; West crossed paths with producer/DJ [[No I.D.]], with whom he quickly formed a close friendship. No I.D. soon became West's mentor, and it was from him that West learned how to sample and program beats after he received his first [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]] at age 15.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bXy2wTEsbCsC|title=Icons of Hip Hop: An Encyclopedia of the Movement, Music, and Culture|last=Dills|first=Todd|date=|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2007|isbn=9780313339042|editor-last=Hess|editor-first=Mickey|volume=2|location=Westport, CT|pages=555578|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|557}} After graduating from high school, West received a scholarship to attend Chicago's [[American Academy of Art]] in 1997 and began taking painting classes, but shortly after transferred to [[Chicago State University]] to study English. He soon realized that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his musical work, and at 20 he dropped out of college to pursue his musical dreams.&lt;ref&gt;West, Donda, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; This action greatly displeased his mother, who was also a professor at the university. She later commented, "It was drummed into my head that college is the ticket to a good life... but some career goals don't require college. For Kanye to make an album called ''College Dropout'' it was more about having the guts to embrace who you are, rather than following the path society has carved out for you."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|558}}

In 2015, West was awarded an honorary doctorate from the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago|School of the Art Institute in Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/11/kanye-west-receives-honorary-doctorate-chicago|title=Kanye West receives honorary doctorate in Chicago|first=Guardian|last=staff|date=May 11, 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===19962002: Early work and Roc-A-Fella Records===
Kanye West began his early production career in the mid-1990s, making beats primarily for burgeoning local artists, eventually developing a style that involved speeding up vocal samples from classic [[Soul music|soul]] records. His first official production credits came at the age of nineteen when he produced eight tracks on ''Down to Earth'', the 1996 debut album of a Chicago rapper named Grav.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photos: Kanye West's Career Highs  and Lows 1 of 24|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/photos-kanye-wests-career-highs-and-lows-20101210|work=Rolling Stone|date=December 10, 2010|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, West acted as a ghost producer for [[D-Dot|Deric "D-Dot" Angelettie]]. Because of his association with D-Dot, West wasn't able to release a solo album, so he formed and became a member and producer of the Go-Getters, a late-1990s Chicago rap group composed of him, [[GLC (rapper)|GLC]], Timmy G, [[Really Doe]], and Arrowstar.&lt;ref name=Barber&gt;{{cite web|author=Barber, Andrew|title=93.

After attending a series of promotional [[photo shoot]]s and making some radio appearances, The Go-Getters released their first and only studio album ''World Record Holders'' in 1999. The album featured other Chicago-based rappers such as [[Rhymefest]], Mikkey Halsted, Miss Criss, and Shayla G. Meanwhile, the production was handled by West, Arrowstar, Boogz, and Brian "All Day" Miller.&lt;ref name=Barber/&gt;

West spent much of the late 1990s producing records for a number of well-known artists and music groups.&lt;ref name="Saddleback"&gt;{{cite book|title=Kanye West: Hip-Hop Biographies|author=Saddleback|date=January 1, 2013|publisher=Saddleback Education Publishing|location=|isbn=978-1622500161|page=18|pages=|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third song on [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]]'s second studio album ''[[Chyna Doll (album)|Chyna Doll]]'' was produced by West. Her second effort subsequently became the very first hip-hop album by a female rapper to debut at the top of the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart in its first week of release.&lt;ref name="Saddleback"/&gt; West produced three of the tracks on [[Harlem World (group)|Harlem World]]'s first and only album ''[[The Movement (Harlem World album)|The Movement]]'' alongside [[Jermaine Dupri]] and the production duo [[Trackmasters]]. His songs featured rappers [[Nas]], [[Drag-On]], and [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] singer [[Carl Thomas (singer)|Carl Thomas]].&lt;ref name="Saddleback"/&gt; The ninth track from ''[[World Party (album)|World Party]]'', the last [[Goodie Mob]] album to feature the rap group's four founding members prior to their break-up, was co-produced by West with his manager Deric "D-Dot" Angelettie.&lt;ref name="Saddleback"/&gt; At the close of the millennium, West ended up producing six songs for ''[[Tell 'Em Why U Madd]]'', an album that was released by D-Dot under the alias of The Madd Rapper; a fictional character he created for a [[Hip hop skit|skit]] on [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]'s second and final studio album ''[[Life After Death]]''. West's songs featured guest appearances from rappers such as [[Mase|Ma$e]], [[Raekwon]], and [[Eminem]].&lt;ref name="Saddleback"/&gt;

West got his big break in the year 2000, when he began to produce for artists on [[Roc-A-Fella Records]]. West came to achieve recognition and is often credited with revitalizing Jay-Z's career with his contributions to the rap mogul's influential 2001 album ''[[The Blueprint]]''.&lt;ref name="Mitchum"/&gt; ''The Blueprint'' is consistently ranked among the greatest hip-hop albums, and the critical and financial success of the album generated substantial interest in West as a producer.&lt;ref name="RS500"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/jay-z-the-blueprint-20120524|title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time: #464 (The Blueprint)|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=November 18, 2003|accessdate=June 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serving as an in-house producer for Roc-A-Fella Records, West produced records for other artists from the label, including [[Beanie Sigel]], [[Freeway (rapper)|Freeway]], and [[Cam'ron]].

West recorded the remainder of the album in Los Angeles while recovering from the car accident. Once he had completed the album, it was leaked months before its release date.&lt;ref name="Road"/&gt; However, West decided to use the opportunity to review the album, and ''The College Dropout'' was significantly remixed, remastered, and revised before being released.

''The College Dropout'' was eventually issued by Roc-A-Fella in February 2004, shooting to number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] as his debut single, "[[Through the Wire]]" peaked at number fifteen on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for five weeks.&lt;ref name=acharts&gt;[http://acharts.us/song/337 Kanye West  Through the Wire  Music Charts]. aCharts.us.

''The College Dropout'' received near-universal critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, was voted the top album of the year by two major music publications, and has consistently been ranked among the great hip-hop works and debut albums by artists. "[[Jesus Walks]]", the album's fourth single, perhaps exposed West to a wider audience; the song's subject matter concerns faith and Christianity.

==Controversies==

===General media===

West has been an outspoken and controversial celebrity throughout his career, receiving both criticism and praise from many, including the mainstream media, other artists and entertainers, and two U.S. presidents.&lt;ref name="amg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes"/&gt; On September 2, 2005, during a benefit concert for [[Hurricane Katrina]] relief on NBC (''[[A Concert for Hurricane Relief]]''), he deviated from the prepared script to criticize the media's portrayal of, and the federal response to, black victims of the hurricane. He criticized President [[George W. Bush]] for not "car[ing] about black people".&lt;ref&gt;West's speech at ''A Concert for Hurricane Relief'': "I hate the way they portray us in the media. You see a black family, it says, 'They're looting.' You see a white family, it says, 'They're looking for food.' And, you know, it's been five days [waiting for federal help] because most of the people are black. And even for me to complain about it, I would be a hypocrite because I've tried to turn away from the TV because it's too hard to watch. I've even been shopping before even giving a donation, so now I'm calling my business manager right now to see what is the biggest amount I can give, and just to imagine if I was down there, and those are my people down there. So anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can helpwith the way America is set up to help the poor, the black people, the less well-off, as slow as possible. I mean, the Red Cross is doing everything they can. We already realize a lot of people that could help are at war right now, fighting another wayand they've given them permission to go down and shoot us!"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=44415a2b-7481-45f8-91a3-630b0b5510de&amp;entry=index|title=NBC KO's Kanye's Bush Bashing|last=Byrne|first=Bridget|work=E!

Reactions were mixed, but some felt that West had no need to apologize. "It was not the particulars of your words that mattered, it was the essence of a feeling of the insensitivity towards our communities that many of us have felt for far too long," argued [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]] co-founder [[Russell Simmons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=February 9, 2011|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/russell-simmons/dear-kanye-west_b_782932.html|title=Dear Kanye West...|work=The Huffington Post|location=USA|date=November 12, 2010|first=Russell|last=Simmons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 he said he will go down in history as "the voice of this generation", a comment that was widely ridiculed, notably in the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Fishsticks (South Park)|Fishsticks]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/id/27704066/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/kanye-west-says-hes-voice-generation/|title=Kanye West says he's 'voice of this generation'| date=November 13, 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/kanye-west-792-1336735|title=Kanye West claims he's the 'voice of this generation' - NME|date=November 14, 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2502167/kanye-west-still-perplexed-by-fish-sticks-joke-on-south-park-finale/|title=Kanye West Still Perplexed By Fish Sticks Joke On South Park Finale|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, West was widely rebuked by human rights groups for performing in [[Kazakhstan]], which has one of the [[Human rights in Kazakhstan|poorest human rights records in the world]], at the wedding of authoritarian President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]]'s grandson.&lt;ref name=Roth2Sept&gt;{{cite news|url=https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/kanye-west-sings-at-kazakh-wedding/|title=Kanye West Sings at Kazakh Wedding|work=The New York Times|date=September 2, 2013|accessdate=October 17, 2015|first=Andrew|last=Roth}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable Western performers, including [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], have previously cancelled performances in the country over human rights concerns.&lt;ref name=Blistein3Sept&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kanye-west-performed-for-kazakh-strongmans-family-20130903|title=Kanye West Performed for Kazakh Strongman's Family|work=Rolling Stone|date=September 3, 2013|accessdate=October 14, 2015|first=Jon|last=Blistein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Michaels2Sept/&gt; West was reportedly paid US$3 million for his performance.&lt;ref name=Michaels2Sept&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/02/kanye-west-gig-kazakhstan|title=Kanye West plays lucrative gig for controversial Kazakhstan president|date=September 2, 2013|accessdate=October 14, 2015|work=The Guardian|first=Sean|last=Michaels}}&lt;/ref&gt; West had previously participated in cultural boycotts, joining [[Shakira]] and [[Rage Against The Machine]] in refusing to perform in [[Arizona]] after the 2010 implementation of stop and search laws directed against potential illegal aliens.&lt;ref name=OSullivan12July&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.thenational.ae/arts-culture/music/the-recent-rise-in-musical-boycotts|title=The recent rise in cultural boycotts|work=The National|date=July 12, 2011|accessdate=October 17, 2015|first=Feargus|last=O'Sullivan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a November 26, 2013 radio interview, West explained why he believed that President Obama had problems pushing policies in Washington: "Man, let me tell you something about George Bush and oil money and Obama and no money. People want to say Obama can't make these moves or he's not executing. That's because he ain't got those connections. Black people don't have the same level of connections as Jewish people...We ain't Jewish. We don't got family that got money like that." In response to his comments, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] stated: "There it goes again, the age-old canard that Jews are all-powerful and control the levers of power in government."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/05/kanye-west-anti-semitism_n_4390590.html Kanye West's Week Includes Accusations Of Anti-Semitism, Weak Attendance At Kansas City Gig] by The Huffington Post, Matthew Jacobs, May 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; On December 21, 2013, West backed off of the original comment and told a Chicago radio station that "I thought I was giving a compliment, but if anything it came off more ignorant. I don't know how being told you have money is an insult."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=JPost.com Staff|date=December 22, 2013|title=Kanye West wants to take back 'ignorant compliment' about Jews|url=http://www.jpost.com/Arts-and-Culture/Arts/Kanye-West-wants-to-takes-back-ignorant-compliment-about-Jews-335795|newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|location=Jerusalem, Israel|publisher=Palestine Post Ltd.|accessdate=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, West again became embroiled in controversy when he posted a tweet seemingly asserting [[Bill Cosby]]'s innocence in the wake of [[Bill Cosby sexual assault allegations|over 50 women making allegations of sexual assault directed at Cosby.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/10/entertainment/kanye-west-bill-cosby-innocent-tweet/index.html|title=Kanye West's 'Bill Cosby Innocent' tweet sparks outrage|first=Leinz Vales|last=CNN|work=cnn.com|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, West caused controversy when he said, "When you hear about slavery for 400 years ... for 400 years? That sounds like a choice. You were there for 400 years and it's all of y'all. It's like we're mentally imprisoned." during an appearance on [[TMZ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=https://amp.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/01/kanye-west-on-slavery-for-400-years-that-sounds-like-a-choice|title=Kanye West on slavery: 'For 400 years?

My point is for us to have stayed in that position even though the numbers were on our side means that we were mentally enslaved" and "The reason why I brought up the 400 years point is because we can't be mentally imprisoned for another 400 years. We need free thought now. Even the statement was an example of free thought. It was just an idea. Once again I am being attacked for presenting new ideas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/01/entertainment/kanye-west-slavery-choice-trnd/index.html|title=Kanye West just said 400 years of slavery was a choice|first=Harmeet|last=Kaur|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of his career, West has been known to compare himself to various influential figures and entities in art and culture, including [[Donald Trump]], [[Steve Jobs]], [[Socrates]], [[Walt Disney]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Anna Wintour]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Howard Hughes]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Nike Inc.|Nike]], [[Kurt Cobain]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Axl Rose]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Jim Morrison]], [[Willy Wonka]], [[David Stern]],

===Award shows===
In 2004, West had his first of a number of public incidents during his attendance at music award events. At the [[American Music Awards of 2004]], West stormed out of the auditorium after losing Best New Artist to country singer [[Gretchen Wilson]]. He later commented, "I felt like I was definitely robbed [...] I was the best new artist this year."&lt;ref name="http"/&gt; After the 2006 Grammy nominations were released, West said he would "really have a problem" if he did not win the Album of the Year, saying, "I don't care what I do, I don't care how much I stunt  you can never take away from the amount of work I put into it. I don't want to hear all of that [[political correctness|politically correct]] stuff."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=April 26, 2008|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=7&amp;entry_id=2120|title=Kanye Has His Sights on Best Album|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=December 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 2, 2006, when his "Touch the Sky" failed to win Best Video at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]], West went onto the stage as the award was being presented to [[Justice (band)|Justice]] and [[Simian (band)|Simian]] for "[[We Are Your Friends (song)|We Are Your Friends]]" and argued that he should have won the award instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=April 24, 2008|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,227304,00.html|title=Kanye West Unleashes Tirade After Losing at MTV Europe Music Awards|publisher=Fox News Channel|date=November 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/channel/mtvuk/news/02112006/emas_shocker_kanye_stage_invasion|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603120826/http://www.mtv.co.uk/channel/mtvuk/news/02112006/emas_shocker_kanye_stage_invasion|archivedate=June 3, 2007|title=EMAs Shocker: Kanye Stage Invasion!|accessdate=June 7, 2007|publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of news outlets worldwide criticized the outburst.

On September 9, 2007, West suggested that his [[race (classification of human beings)|race]] had something to do with his being overlooked for opening the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards]] (VMAs) in favor of [[Britney Spears]]; he claimed, "Maybe my skin's not right."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 24, 2008|url=http://www.britneyspy.com/2007/09/09/kanye-west-jealous-of-britney-opening-the-vmas/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424051758/http://www.britneyspy.com/2007/09/09/kanye-west-jealous-of-britney-opening-the-vmas/|archivedate=April 24, 2008|title=Kanye West Jealous Of Britney Opening The VMAs|publisher=Britney Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt; West was performing at the event; that night, he lost all five awards that he was nominated for, including Best Male Artist and Video of the Year. After the show, he was visibly upset that he had lost at the VMAs two years in a row, stating that he would not come back to MTV ever again. He also appeared on several radio stations saying that when he made the song "Stronger" that it was his dream to open the VMAs with it.

===Legal issues===
In December 2006, [[Evel Knievel|Robert "Evel" Knievel]] sued West for trademark infringement in West's video for "[[Touch the Sky (Kanye West song)|Touch the Sky]]".

The suit sought monetary damages and an injunction to stop distribution of the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/1212061evel1.html|title=Evel Knievel Sues Kanye West|accessdate=June 7, 2007|publisher=[[The Smoking Gun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; West's attorneys argued that the music video amounted to satire and therefore was covered under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. Just days before his death in November 2007, Knievel amicably settled the suit after being paid a visit from West, saying, "I thought he was a wonderful guy and quite a gentleman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Evel Knievel, Kanye West settle lawsuit|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2007-11-27-kanye-knievel_N.htm|work=USA Today|date=November 27, 2007|accessdate=November 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, after an altercation with a [[paparazzo]] at Los Angeles Airport, West was sentenced to serve two years' probation for a misdemeanor battery conviction, and was required to attend 24 anger management sessions, perform 250 hours of community service, and pay restitution to the photographer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duke|first=Alan|title=Kanye West gets probation in paparazzi attack|publisher=CNN|date=March 17, 2014|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/17/showbiz/kanye-west-plea-deal/|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious beliefs===
After the success of his song "[[Jesus Walks]]" from the album ''[[The College Dropout]]'', West was questioned on his beliefs and said, "I will say that I'm spiritual. I have accepted Jesus as my Savior. And I will say that I fall short every day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=OGUNNAIKE|first=LOLA|title=A Trinity of Videos for One Religious Rap|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/23/arts/a-trinity-of-videos-for-one-religious-rap.html?scp=1&amp;sq=|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 23, 2004|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 interview with ''[[The Fader]]'', West stated that "I'm like a vessel, and God has chosen me to be the voice and the connector."&lt;ref name="vulturejesus"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lyons|first1=Margaret|title=Does Kanye West Think He's God?

In a 2009 interview with online magazine [[Bossip]], West clarified that he believed in God, but "would never go into a religion," explaining that "I feel like religion is more about separation and judgment than bringing people together and understanding. That's all I'm about."&lt;ref name="bossip"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=Exclusive* [Pt. 1] Kanye Discusses Religion|url=http://bossip.com/76535/exclusive-pt-1-kanye-religion-is-like-branding/|website=[[Bossip]]|accessdate=May 1, 2016|deadurl=unfit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211144515/http://bossip.com/76535/exclusive-pt-1-kanye-religion-is-like-branding/|archivedate=February 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2014, West referred to himself as a [[Christian]] during one of his concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Gabby|last1=Bess|title=Kanye West Proclaims: "I'm a Married, Christian Man!"|url=http://www.papermag.com/kanye-west-proclaims-im-a-married-christian-man-1427407473.html|website=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]|date=September 16, 2014|accessdate=November 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health===

In 2010, for a screening of his movie ''[[Runaway (2010 film)|Runaway]]'', West told the audience he once [[Suicidal ideation|considered suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/953402/kanye-west-says-he-had-considered-suicide|title=Kanye West Says He Had Considered Suicide|work=Billboard|date=October 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his song "FML" and his featured verse on [[Vic Mensa]]'s song "U Mad", he refers to using the antidepressant medication [[Lexapro]], and in his song "I Feel Like That", which has not been officially released, he mentions feeling many common symptoms of depression and anxiety. These songs had all been recorded during West's recording sessions for ''The Life of Pablo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/yvwbv7/one-of-the-most-powerful-kanye-west-songs-is-one-youve-probably-not-heard|title=One of the Most Powerful Kanye West Songs is One You've Probably Not Heard|work=Vice|date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box
|quote=Mr. West has had the most [[sui generis]] hip-hop career of the last decade. No rapper has embodied hip-hop's often contradictory impulses of narcissism and social good quite as he has, and no producer has celebrated the lush and the ornate quite as he has. He has spent most of his career in additive mode, figuring out how to make music that's majestic and thought-provoking and grand-scaled. And he's also widened the genre's gates, whether for middle-class values or high-fashion and high-art dreams.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Kanye West would be the first person to tell you he belongs on this list. The dude doesn't believe in false modesty, and he shouldn't [...] He fought for his place in the cultural pantheon with a purpose. In his debut album, over a decade ago, Kanye issued what amounted to a social critique and a call to arms (with a beat): "We rappers is role models: we rap, we don't think." But Kanye does think. Constantly. About everything. And he wants everybody else to do the same: to engage, question, push boundaries. Now that he's a pop-culture juggernaut, he has the platform to achieve just that. He's not afraid of being judged or ridiculed in the process.
