'''Victor Marie Hugo''' ({{IPA-fr|vikt mai yo|lang|Victor_Hugo.ogg}}; 26 February 1802  22 May 1885) was a French poet, novelist, and dramatist of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]]. Hugo is considered to be one of the greatest and best-known French writers. Outside of France, his most famous works are the novels ''[[Les Misrables]]'', 1862, and ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'' ({{lang-fr|links=no|Notre-Dame de Paris}}), 1831. In France, Hugo is known primarily for his poetry collections, such as {{lang|fr|[[Les Contemplations]]}} (''The Contemplations'') and {{lang|fr|[[La Lgende des sicles]]}} (''The Legend of the Ages''). 

Hugo was at the forefront of the [[Romanticism|romantic literary movement]] with his play ''[[Cromwell (play)|Cromwell]]'' and drama ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]''. Many of his works have inspired music, both during his lifetime and after his death, including the musicals ''[[Notre-Dame de Paris (musical)|Notre-Dame de Paris]]'' and ''[[Les Misrables (musical)|Les Misrables]]''. He produced more than 4,000 drawings in his lifetime, and campaigned for social causes such as the abolition of [[Capital punishment in France|capital punishment]]. 

Though a committed [[royalist]] when he was young, Hugo's views changed as the decades passed, and he became a passionate supporter of [[republicanism]]; his work touches upon most of the political and social issues and the artistic trends of his time. He is buried in the [[Panthon]] in Paris. His legacy has been honoured in many ways, including his portrait being placed on French currency.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Victor Hugo was the third son of [[Joseph Lopold Sigisbert Hugo]] (17741828) and {{lang|fr|Sophie Trbuchet}} (17721821); his brothers were {{lang|fr|Abel Joseph Hugo}} (17981855) and {{lang|fr|Eugne Hugo}} (18001837). He was born in 1802 in {{lang|fr|[[Besanon]]}} in the eastern region of {{lang|fr|[[Franche-Comt]]}}. On 19 November 1821, Lopold Hugo wrote to his son that he had been conceived on one of the highest peaks in the [[Vosges Mountains]], on a journey from Lunville to Besanon. " This elevated origin, he went on, seems to have had effects on you so that your muse is now continually sublime.&lt;ref&gt;Escholier, Raymond, ''Victor Hugo racont par ceux qui l'ont vu'', Librairie Stock, 1931, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;" Lopold Hugo was a [[freethought|freethinking]] [[republicanism|republican]] who considered [[Napoleon]] a hero; by contrast, Sophie Hugo was a Catholic [[House of Bourbon|Royalist]] who was intimately involved with her possible lover General {{lang|fr|[[Victor Lahorie]]}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Behr |first=Edward |title=The Complete Book of {{lang|fr|Les Misrables|nocat=y}} |year=1993 |publisher=Arcade Publishing |pages=8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qiCO4XZ2K6IC&amp;pg=PA8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was executed in 1812 for plotting against Napoleon.

Hugo's childhood was a period of national political turmoil. Napoleon was proclaimed [[Emperor of the French]] two years after Hugo's birth, and the [[Bourbon Restoration|Bourbon Monarchy was restored]] before his 13th birthday. The opposing political and religious views of Hugo's parents reflected the forces that would battle for supremacy in France throughout his life: Hugo's father was a high-ranking officer in Napoleon's army until he failed in Spain (one of the reasons why his name is not present on the {{lang|fr|[[Arc de Triomphe]]}}).

Since Hugo's father was an officer, the family moved frequently and Hugo learned much from these travels. On a childhood family trip to [[Naples]], Hugo saw the vast [[Alps|Alpine]] passes and the snowy peaks, the magnificently blue Mediterranean, and Rome during its festivities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Josephson |first=Matthew |title=Victor Hugo: A Realistic Biography of the Great Romantic |year=2006 |publisher=Jorge Pinto Books, Inc. |pages=4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tiP_ezL6v54C&amp;pg=PA4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he was only five years old at the time, he remembered the six-month-long trip vividly. They stayed in Naples for a few months and then headed back to Paris.

At the beginning of her marriage, Hugo's mother Sophie followed her husband to posts in Italy (where {{lang|fr|Lopold}} served as a governor of a province near Naples) and Spain (where he took charge of three Spanish provinces). Weary of the constant moving required by military life, and at odds with her husband's lack of Catholic beliefs, Sophie separated temporarily from {{lang|fr|Lopold}} in 1803 and settled in Paris with her children. Thereafter she dominated Hugo's education and upbringing. As a result, Hugo's early work in poetry and fiction reflect her passionate devotion to both [[Monarchism|King]] and [[Faith in Christianity|Faith]]. It was only later, during the events leading up to France's [[French Revolution of 1848|1848 Revolution]], that he would begin to rebel against his Catholic Royalist education and instead champion Republicanism and [[Freethought]].

Young Victor fell in love with and became secretly engaged to his childhood friend {{lang|fr|Adle Foucher}} (18031868), against his mother's wishes. Because of his close relationship with his mother, Hugo waited until after her death (in 1821) to marry {{lang|fr|Adle}} in 1822.

Adle and Victor Hugo had their first child, {{lang|fr|Lopold}}, in 1823, but the boy died in infancy. On 28 August 1824, the couple's second child, {{lang|fr|[[Lopoldine Hugo|Lopoldine]]}} was born, followed by [[Charles Hugo (writer)|Charles]] on 4 November 1826, {{lang|fr|[[Franois-Victor Hugo|Franois-Victor]]}} on 28 October 1828, and [[Adle Hugo|Adle]] on 24 August 1830.

Hugo's eldest and favourite daughter, {{lang|fr|Lopoldine}}, died aged 19 in 1843, shortly after her marriage to {{lang|fr|[[Charles Vacquerie]]}}. On 4 September, she drowned in the [[Seine]] at {{lang|fr|[[Villequier]]}}, pulled down by her heavy skirts when a boat overturned. Her young husband also died trying to save her. The death left her father devastated; Hugo was travelling with his mistress at the time in the south of France, and first learned about {{lang|fr|Lopoldine}}'s death from a newspaper he read in a caf.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|fr|Victor Hugo, tome 1: Je suis une force qui va}} by Max Gallo, pub. {{lang|fr|Broch}} (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

He describes his shock and grief in his famous poem {{lang|fr| Villequier}}:

&lt;poem lang="fr" style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;
Hlas ! vers le pass tournant un il d'envie,
Sans que rien ici-bas puisse m'en consoler,
Je regarde toujours ce moment de ma vie
O je l'ai vue ouvrir son aile et s'envoler!

Je verrai cet instant jusqu' ce que je meure,
L'instant, pleurs superflus !
O je criai : L'enfant que j'avais tout  l'heure,
Quoi donc ! je ne l'ai plus !
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem style="margin-left: 1em;"&gt;
Alas! turning an envious eye towards the past,
inconsolable by anything on earth,
I keep looking at that moment of my life
when I saw her open her wings and fly away!

I will see that instant until I die,
that instanttoo much for tears!
when I cried out: "The child that I had just now
what! I don't have her any more!"
&lt;/poem&gt;

He wrote many poems afterwards about his daughter's life and death, and at least one biographer claims he never completely recovered from it. His most famous poem is probably {{lang|fr|Demain, ds l'aube}} (Tomorrow, At Dawn), in which he describes visiting her grave.

Hugo decided to live in exile after [[Napoleon III]]'s [[French coup d'tat of 1851|{{lang|fr|coup d'tat|nocat=y}} at the end of 1851]]. After leaving France, Hugo lived in [[Brussels]] briefly in 1851, before moving to the [[Channel Islands]], first to [[Jersey]] (18521855) and then to the smaller island of [[Guernsey]] in 1855, where he stayed until Napoleon III's fall from power in 1870. Although Napoleon III proclaimed a general amnesty in 1859, under which Hugo could have safely returned to France, the author stayed in exile, only returning when Napoleon III was forced from power as a result of the French defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870. After the [[Siege of Paris (1870-71)|Siege of Paris]] from 1870 to 1871, Hugo lived again in Guernsey from 1872 to 1873, before finally returning to France for the remainder of his life.

==Writings==
[[File:Victor Hugo by Charles Hugo, c1850-55.jpg|thumb|250px|Victor Hugo in 1853]]

Hugo published his first novel the year following his marriage ({{lang|fr|[[Han d'Islande]]}}, 1823), and his second three years later (''[[Bug-Jargal]]'', 1826). Between 1829 and 1840, he published five more volumes of poetry ({{lang|fr|[[Les Orientales]]}}, 1829; {{lang|fr|[[Les Feuilles d'automne]]}}, 1831; {{lang|fr|[[Les Chants du crpuscule]]}}, 1835; {{lang|fr|[[Les Voix intrieures]]}}, 1837; and {{lang|fr|[[Les Rayons et les Ombres]]}}, 1840), cementing his reputation as one of the greatest elegiac and lyric poets of his time.

Like many young writers of his generation, Hugo was profoundly influenced by {{lang|fr|[[Franois-Ren de Chateaubriand]]}}, the famous figure in the literary movement of [[Romanticism]] and France's pre-eminent literary figure during the early 19th century. In his youth, Hugo resolved to be "{{lang|fr|Chateaubriand}} or nothing", and his life would come to parallel that of his predecessor in many ways. Like {{lang|fr|Chateaubriand}}, Hugo furthered the cause of Romanticism, became involved in politics (though mostly as a champion of [[Republicanism]]), and was forced into [[exile]] due to his political stances.

The precocious passion and eloquence of Hugo's early work brought success and fame at an early age. His first collection of poetry ({{lang|fr|[[Odes et posies diverses]]}}) was published in 1822 when he was only 20 years old and earned him a royal pension from [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]]. Though the poems were admired for their spontaneous fervour and fluency, the collection that followed four years later in 1826 ({{lang|fr|[[Odes et Ballades]]}}) revealed Hugo to be a great poet, a natural master of lyric and creative song.

Victor Hugo's first mature work of fiction was first published in February 1829 by Charles Gosselin without the author's name and reflected the acute social conscience that would infuse his later work. {{lang|fr|Le Dernier jour d'un condamn}} (''[[The Last Day of a Condemned Man]]'') would have a profound influence on later writers such as [[Albert Camus]], [[Charles Dickens]], and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]. {{lang|fr|[[Claude Gueux]]}}, a documentary short story about a real-life murderer who had been executed in France. On 15 March 1832, Hugo completed this story with a long preface and his signature which was later considered by Hugo himself to be a precursor to his great work on social injustice, {{lang|fr|[[Les Misrables]]}}.

Hugo became the figurehead of the Romantic literary movement with the plays ''Cromwell'' (1827) and ''Hernani'' (1830).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=State Library of Victoria |title=Victor Hugo: Les Misrables  From Page to Stage research guide |url=http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/victorhugo |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714180659/http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/victorhugo |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hernani'' announced the arrival of French romanticism: performed at the [[Comdie-Franaise]], it was greeted with several nights of rioting as romantics and traditionalists clashed over the play's deliberate disregard for neo-classical rules. Hugo's popularity as a playwright grew with subsequent plays, such as ''Marion Delorme'' (1831), ''The King Amuses Himself'' (1832), and ''Ruy Blas'' (1838).&lt;ref&gt;Brockett, Oscar G. ''History of the Theatre''. Eight Edition. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1999. P. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugo's novel {{lang|fr|Notre-Dame de Paris}} (''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'') was published in 1831 and quickly translated into other languages across Europe. One of the effects of the novel was to shame the City of Paris into restoring the much-neglected [[Notre Dame de Paris|Cathedral of Notre Dame]], which was attracting thousands of tourists who had read the popular novel. The book also inspired a renewed appreciation for pre-Renaissance buildings, which thereafter began to be actively preserved.

[[File:Ebcosette.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of "{{lang|fr|[[Cosette]]}}" by {{lang|fr|[[mile Bayard]]}}, from the original edition of {{lang|fr|[[Les Misrables]]}} (1862)]]
Hugo began planning a major novel about social misery and injustice as early as the 1830s, but a full 17 years were needed for {{lang|fr|Les Misrables}} to be realised and finally published in 1862.
Hugo had used the departure of prisoners for the [[Bagne of Toulon]] in one of his early stories, "Le Dernier Jour d'un condamn"  He went to Toulon to visit the Bagne in 1839 and took extensive notes, though he did not start writing the book until 1845.  On one of the pages of his notes about the prison, he wrote in large block letters a possible name for his hero: " JEAN TRJEAN".  When the book was finally written, Trjean became Jean Valjean.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Bagne de Toulon (17481873)'', Acadmie du Var, Autres Temps Editions (2010), {{ISBN|978-2-84521-394-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugo was acutely aware of the quality of the novel, as evidenced in a letter he wrote to his publisher, Albert Lacroix, on 23 March 1862, "My conviction is that this book is going to be one of the peaks, if not the crowning point of my work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alalettre.com/Hugo-miserables.htm|title=Les Misrables de Victor Hugo - aLaLettre|work=alalettre.com|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; So publication of the Miserables went to the highest bidder. The Belgian publishing house {{lang|fr|Lacroix}} and {{lang|nl|Verboeckhoven|nocat=y}} undertook a marketing campaign unusual for the time, issuing press releases about the work a full six months before the launch. It also initially published only the first part of the novel ("Fantine"), which was launched simultaneously in major cities. Installments of the book sold out within hours and had enormous impact on French society.

The critical establishment was generally hostile to the novel; {{lang|fr|[[Hippolyte Taine|Taine]]}} found it insincere, [[Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly|Barbey d'Aurevilly]] complained of its vulgarity, {{lang|fr|[[Gustave Flaubert]]}} found within it "neither truth nor greatness", the [[Goncourt brothers|{{lang|fr|Goncourt|nocat=y}} brothers]] lambasted its artificiality, and {{lang|fr|[[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]]}}  despite giving favourable reviews in newspapers  castigated it in private as "repulsive and inept". ''Les Misrables'' proved popular enough with the masses that the issues it highlighted were soon on the agenda of the [[National Assembly of France]]. Today, the novel remains his most enduringly popular work. It is popular worldwide and has been adapted for cinema, television, and stage shows.

An apocryphal tale&lt;ref&gt;Garson O'Toole, [http://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/06/14/exclamation/ "Briefest Correspondence: Question Mark? Exclamation Mark!"] (14 June 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; about the shortest correspondence in history is said to have been between Hugo and his publisher [[Hurst and Blackett]] in 1862. Hugo was on vacation when {{lang|fr|Les Misrables}} was published. He queried the reaction to the work by sending a single-character [[telegram]] to his publisher, asking &lt;tt&gt;?&lt;/tt&gt;. The publisher replied with a single &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt; to indicate its success.&lt;ref&gt;Norris McWhirter (1981). ''Guinness Book of World Records: 1981 Edition''. Bantam Books, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugo turned away from social/political issues in his next novel, {{lang|fr|Les Travailleurs de la Mer}} (''[[Toilers of the Sea]]''), published in 1866. The book was well received, perhaps due to the previous success of {{lang|fr|Les Misrables}}. Dedicated to the channel island of [[Guernsey]], where he spent 15 years of exile, Hugo tells of a man who attempts to win the approval of his beloved's father by rescuing his ship, intentionally marooned by its captain who hopes to escape with a treasure of money it is transporting, through an exhausting battle of human engineering against the force of the sea and a battle against an almost mythical beast of the sea, a giant squid. Superficially an adventure, one of Hugo's biographers calls it a "metaphor for the 19th centurytechnical progress, creative genius and hard work overcoming the immanent evil of the material world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robb |first=Graham |title=Victor Hugo: A Biography |year=1997 |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company |page=414 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kU9LloPylhQC&amp;pg=PA414&amp; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word used in Guernsey to refer to squid ({{lang|fr|pieuvre}}, also sometimes applied to octopus) was to enter the French language as a result of its use in the book. Hugo returned to political and social issues in his next novel, {{lang|fr|L'Homme Qui Rit}} (''[[The Man Who Laughs]]''), which was published in 1869 and painted a critical picture of the aristocracy. The novel was not as successful as his previous efforts, and Hugo himself began to comment on the growing distance between himself and literary contemporaries such as {{lang|fr|[[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]]}} and {{lang|fr|[[mile Zola]]}}, whose [[Literary realism|realist]] and [[naturalism (literature)|naturalist]] novels were now exceeding the popularity of his own work.

His last novel, {{lang|fr|Quatre-vingt-treize}} (''[[Ninety-Three]]''), published in 1874, dealt with a subject that Hugo had previously avoided: the [[Reign of Terror]] during the [[French Revolution]]. Though Hugo's popularity was on the decline at the time of its publication, many now consider ''Ninety-Three'' to be a work on par with Hugo's better-known novels.

After three unsuccessful attempts, Hugo was finally elected to the {{lang|fr|[[Acadmie franaise]]}} in 1841, solidifying his position in the world of French arts and letters. A group of French academicians, particularly [[Victor-Joseph tienne de Jouy|tienne de Jouy]], were fighting against the "romantic evolution" and had managed to delay Victor Hugo's election.&lt;ref&gt;On the role of E. de Jouy against V.Hugo, see {{lang|fr|Les aventures militaires, littraires et autres de Etienne de Jouy de l'Acadmie franaise}} by Michel Faul (Editions Seguier, France, 2009 {{ISBN|978-2-84049-556-7}})&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, he became increasingly involved in French politics.

He was elevated to the peerage by King {{lang|fr|[[Louis-Philippe]]}} in 1845 and entered the Higher Chamber as a {{lang|fr|[[pair de France]]}}, where he spoke against the [[capital punishment in France|death penalty]] and [[social injustice]], and in favour of [[freedom of the press]] and [[self-government]] for Poland.

In 1848, Hugo was elected to the National Assembly of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] as a conservative. In 1849, he broke with the conservatives when he gave a noted speech calling for the end of misery and poverty. Other speeches called for universal suffrage and free education for all children. Hugo's advocacy to abolish the death penalty was renowned internationally.

These parliamentary speeches are published in {{lang|fr|uvres compltes: actes et paroles I : avant l'exil, 18411851}}. Scroll down to the {{lang|fr|Assemble Constituante 1848}} heading and subsequent pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[State Library of Victoria]] |title=Victor Hugo: {{lang|fr|Les Misrables|nocat=y}}  From Page to Stage research guide |url=http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/content.php?pid=572687&amp;sid=4722472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Louis Napoleon ([[Napoleon III]]) [[French coup d'tat of 1851|seized complete power in 1851]], establishing an anti-parliamentary constitution, Hugo openly declared him a traitor to France. He relocated to [[Brussels]], then [[Jersey]], from which he was expelled for supporting a Jersey newspaper that had criticised Queen Victoria and finally settled with his family at [[Hauteville House]] in [[Saint Peter Port]], [[Guernsey]], where he would live in exile from October 1855 until 1870.

While in exile, Hugo published his famous political pamphlets against Napoleon III, {{lang|fr|[[Napolon le Petit]]}} and {{lang|fr|[[Histoire d'un crime]]}}. The pamphlets were banned in France but nonetheless had a strong impact there. He also composed or published some of his best work during his period in [[Guernsey]], including {{lang|fr|[[Les Misrables]]}}, and three widely praised collections of poetry ({{lang|fr|[[Les Chtiments]]}}, 1853; {{lang|fr|[[Les Contemplations]]}}, 1856; and {{lang|fr|[[La Lgende des sicles]]}}, 1859).

Like most of his contemporaries, Victor Hugo held colonialist views towards Africans. In a speech delivered on 18 May 1879, he declared that the [[Mediterranean Sea]] formed a natural divide between " ultimate civilisation and [] utter barbarism," adding "God offers Africa to Europe. Take it," in order to civilise its indigenous inhabitants. This might partly explain why in spite of his deep interest and involvement in political matters he remained strangely silent on the Algerian issue. He knew about the atrocities committed by the French Army during the [[French conquest of Algeria]] as evidenced by his diary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Choses Vues|last=Hugo|first=Victor|publisher=Gallimard|year=1972|isbn=2-07-040217-7|location=Paris|pages=28687|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he never denounced them publicly. A modern reader may also feel puzzled, to say the least, at the meaning of these lines from the conclusion to Le Rhin, chapter 17,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Rhin/Conclusion/XVIIP|title=Le Rhin|last=Hugo|first=Victor|date=|website=Wikisource.org|publisher=|access-date=31 January 2017}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1842, twelve years after French troops landed near Algiers.

{{Quotation|text=What France lacks in Algiers is a little barbarity. The Turks [...] knew how to cut heads better than we do. The first thing that strikes savages is not reason but strength. What France lacks, England has it; Russia too.|sign=Victor Hugo|source=Le Rhin}}

However, in ''Les Misrables'', Hugo says the following about the conquering of Algeria&lt;ref&gt;Les Misrables, Random House Publishing Group, 2000, 1280 pages, {{ISBN|9780679641551}}, p. 720.&lt;/ref&gt;:

{{Quotation|text=Algeria too harshly conquered, and, as in the case of India by the English, with more barbarism than civilization.|sign=Victor Hugo|source=Les Misrables}}

It should also be noted that before being exiled he never denounced slavery, and no trace of its abolition is to be found in the 27 April 1848 entry of his detailed diary.

On the other hand, Victor Hugo fought a lifelong battle for the abolition of the death penalty as a novelist, diarist, and member of Parliament. [[The Last Day of a Condemned Man]] published in 1829 analyses the pangs of a man awaiting execution; several entries of Things Seen (''Choses vues''), the diary he kept between 1830 and 1885, convey his firm condemnation of what he regarded as a barbaric sentence;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Choses vues|last=Hugo|first=Victor|publisher=Gallimard|year=1972|isbn=2-07-040217-7|location=Paris|pages=26769|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  on 15 September 1848, seven months after the [[French Revolution of 1848|Revolution of 1848]], he delivered a speech before the Assembly and concluded, "You have overthrown the throne. [] Now overthrow the scaffold."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Discours_%C3%A0_l%E2%80%99Assembl%C3%A9e_constituante_1848|title=Speech on the death penalty|last=Hugo|first=Victor|date=15 September 1848|website=Wikisource.org|publisher=|access-date=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His influence was credited in the removal of the death penalty from the constitutions of [[Capital punishment in Switzerland|Geneva]], [[Capital punishment in Portugal|Portugal]], and [[Colombia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/hugo/pedago/dossiers/mort/reperes/signe.htm |title=Victor Hugo, l'homme ocan |publisher={{lang|fr|Bibliothque nationale de France}} |accessdate=19 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had also pleaded for {{lang|se|[[Benito Jurez]]|nocat=y}} to spare the recently captured emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico]] but to no avail. His complete archives (published by Pauvert) show also that he wrote a letter asking the United States government, for the sake of their own reputation in the future, to spare [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown's]] life, but the letter arrived after Brown was executed.

Although Napoleon III granted an amnesty to all political exiles in 1859, Hugo declined, as it meant he would have to curtail his criticisms of the government. It was only after Napoleon III fell from power and the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] was proclaimed that Hugo finally returned to his homeland in 1870, where he was promptly elected to the National Assembly and the Senate.

[[File:Combats dans la rue Rivoli.jpg|thumb|[[Paris Commune|Communards]] defending a barricade on the Rue de Rivoli]]
He was in Paris during the [[Siege of Paris (187071)|siege by the Prussian Army in 1870]], famously eating animals given to him by the Paris Zoo. As the siege continued, and food became ever more scarce, he wrote in his diary that he was reduced to "eating the unknown".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7NtVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=keADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5281%2C6531479 |title=Victor Hugo's diary tells how Parisians dined on zoo animals |newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |location=[[Spokane, Washington]] |page=3 |date=7 February 1915 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Paris Commune]]  the revolutionary government that took power on 18 March 1871 and was toppled on 28 May  Victor Hugo was harshly critical of the atrocities committed on both sides. On 9 April, he wrote in his diary, "In short, this Commune is as idiotic as the National Assembly is ferocious. From both sides, folly."&lt;ref&gt;Hugo, Victor, Choses vues, 18701885, Gallimard, 1972, {{ISBN|2-07-036141-1}}, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Yet he made a point of offering his support to members of the Commune subjected to brutal repression. He had been in [[Brussels]] since 22 March 1871 when in the 27 May issue of the Belgian newspaper ''lIndpendance'' Victor Hugo denounced the governments refusal to grant political asylum to the Communards threatened with imprisonment, banishment or execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&amp;hl=fr&amp;id=GX5JAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=l'ind%C3%A9pendance#v=snippet&amp;q=l'ind%C3%A9pendance&amp;f=false|title=Actes et paroles: 187018711872|first=Victor|last=Hugo|date=1 January 1872|publisher=Michel Lvy frres|accessdate=3 April 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused so much uproar that in the evening a mob of fifty to sixty men attempted to force their way into the writers house shouting " Death to Victor Hugo! Hang him! Death to the scoundrel!"&lt;ref&gt;Hugo, Victor, Choses vues, Gallimard, 1972, {{ISBN|2-07-036141-1}}, pp. 17677&lt;/ref&gt;

Victor Hugo, who said, "A war between Europeans is a civil war&lt;ref&gt;Hugo, Victor, Choses vues, Gallimard, 1972, {{ISBN|2-07-036141-1}}, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;" was an enthusiastic advocate for the creation of the [[United States of Europe]]. He expounded his views on the subject in a speech he delivered during the [[International Peace Congress]] which took place in Paris in 1849. The Congress, of which Hugo was the President, proved to be an international success, attracting such famous philosophers as [[Frederic Bastiat]], [[Charles Gilpin (politician)|Charles Gilpin]], [[Richard Cobden]], and [[Henry Richard]]. The conference helped establish Hugo as a prominent public speaker and sparked his international fame, and promoted the idea of the "United States of Europe"&lt;ref&gt;Peace Congress, 2d, Paris, 1849. Report of the proceedings of the second general Peace Congress, held in Paris on the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th of August, 1849. Compiled from authentic documents under the superintendence of the Peace Congress Committee. London, Charles Gilpin, 1849&lt;/ref&gt;. On July 14, 1870 he planted the "oak of the United States of Europe" in the garden of [[Hauteville House]] where he stayed during his exile on [[Guernsey]] from 1856 to 1870.

Because of his concern for the rights of artists and [[copyright]], he was a founding member of the {{lang|fr|[[Association Littraire et Artistique Internationale]]}}, which led to the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]]. However, in {{lang|fr|Pauvert}}'s published archives, he states strongly that "any work of art has two authors: the people who confusingly feel something, a creator who translates these feelings, and the people again who consecrate his vision of that feeling. When one of the authors dies, the rights should totally be granted back to the other, the people".

==Religious views==
[[File:Victor Hugo bust.jpg|thumb|left|Marble bust of Victor Hugo by {{lang|fr|[[Auguste Rodin]]}}]]
Hugo's religious views changed radically over the course of his life. In his youth and under the influence of his mother, he identified as a Catholic and professed respect for Church hierarchy and authority. From there he became a [[lapsed Catholic|non-practicing Catholic]] and increasingly expressed anti-Catholic and [[anti-clerical]] views. He frequented [[spiritism]] during his exile (where he participated also in many [[sance]]s conducted by Madame [[Delphine de Girardin]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Malgras |first=J. |title=Les Pionniers du Spiritisme en France: Documents pour la formation d'un livre d'Or des Sciences Psychiques |location=Paris |year=1906 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|fr|Chez Victor Hugo. Les tables tournantes de Jersey.}} Extracts from meeting minutes published by {{lang|fr|Gustave Simon}} in 1923&lt;/ref&gt; and in later years settled into a [[rationalist]] [[deism]] similar to that espoused by [[Voltaire]]. A census-taker asked Hugo in 1872 if he was a Catholic, and he replied, "No. A [[Freethought|Freethinker]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gjelten |first=Tom |title=Bacardi and the Long Fight for Cuba |year=2008 |publisher=Penguin |pages=48 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3BDH9FK6grMC&amp;pg=PA48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1872, Hugo never lost his antipathy towards the Catholic Church. He felt the Church was indifferent to the plight of the working class under the oppression of the monarchy. Perhaps he also was upset by the frequency with which his work appeared on the Church's [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|list of banned books]]. Hugo counted 740 attacks on ''Les Misrables'' in the Catholic press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robb |first=Graham |title=Victor Hugo |year=1997 |publisher=Picador |location=London |page=32 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kU9LloPylhQC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Hugo's sons Charles and {{lang|fr|Franois-Victor}} died, he insisted that they be buried without a [[crucifix]] or priest. In his will, he made the same stipulation about his own death and funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Petrucelli |first=Alan |title=Morbid Curiosity: The Disturbing Demises of the Famous and Infamous |year=2009 |publisher=Penguin |page=152 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r7csXXH7S9UC&amp;pg=PT152&amp;lpg=PT152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet he believed in life after death and prayed every single morning and night, convinced as he wrote in ''[[The Man Who Laughs]]'' that "Thanksgiving has wings and flies to its right destination. Your prayer knows its way better than you do".&lt;ref&gt;Hugo, Victor, ''The Man Who Laughs'', CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2014, {{ISBN|978-1495441936}}, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugo's [[rationalism]] can be found in poems such as ''[[Torquemada (play)|Torquemada]]'' (1869, about [[religious fanaticism]]), ''The Pope'' (1878, [[anti-clerical]]), ''Religions and Religion'' (1880, denying the usefulness of churches) and, published posthumously, ''The End of Satan'' and ''God'' (1886 and 1891 respectively, in which he represents Christianity as a [[griffin]] and [[rationalism]] as an [[angel]]). [[Vincent van Gogh]] ascribed the saying "Religions pass away, but God remains", actually by [[Jules Michelet]], to Hugo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let294/letter.html#n-6 |title=Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh.

==Victor Hugo and music==
[[File:Victor hugo.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Photogravure]] of Victor Hugo, 1883]]
Although Hugo's many talents did not include exceptional musical ability, he nevertheless had a great impact on the music world through the inspiration that his works provided for composers of the 19th and 20th century. Hugo himself particularly enjoyed the music of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]]. In {{lang|fr|Les Misrables}}, he calls the huntsman's chorus in Weber's ''[[Euryanthe]]'', "perhaps the most beautiful piece of music ever composed".&lt;ref&gt;Hugo, V., {{lang|fr|Les misrables}}, Volume 2, Penguin Books, 1 December 1980, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; He also greatly admired [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and rather unusually for his time, he also appreciated works by composers from earlier centuries such as [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] and [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;"{{lang|fr|Hugo  l'Opra}}", ed. Arnaud Laster, {{lang|fr|L'Avant-Scne Opra}}, no. 208 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Two famous musicians of the 19th century were friends of Hugo: [[Hector Berlioz]] and [[Franz Liszt]]. The latter played Beethoven in Hugo's home, and Hugo joked in a letter to a friend that, thanks to Liszt's piano lessons, he learned how to play a favourite song on the piano  with only one finger. Hugo also worked with composer [[Louise Bertin]], writing the libretto for her 1836 opera ''[[La Esmeralda (opera)|La Esmeralda]]'', which was based on the character in ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"/&gt; Although for various reasons the opera closed soon after its fifth performance and is little known today, it has enjoyed a modern revival, both in a piano/song concert version by Liszt at the {{lang|fr|Festival international Victor Hugo et gaux}} 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.festival-victorhugo-egaux.fr/cadrefrefigur07.htm {{lang|fr|Cette page utilise des cadres|nocat=y}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508142413/http://www.festival-victorhugo-egaux.fr/cadrefrefigur07.htm |date=8 May 2008 }}. {{lang|fr|Festival international Victor Hugo et gaux}}. Retrieved 19 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a full orchestral version presented in July 2008 at {{lang|fr|Le Festival de Radio France et Montpellier Languedoc-Roussillon}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festivalradiofrancemontpellier.com/2008/23-juillet-opera-laesmeralda-louise-bertin.php |title=Mercredi 23 juillet - 20h - Opra Berlioz / Le Corum |accessdate=2008-04-13 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509154928/http://www.festivalradiofrancemontpellier.com/2008/23-juillet-opera-laesmeralda-louise-bertin.php |archivedate=9 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, he had low esteem for [[Richard Wagner]], whom he described as "a man of talent coupled with imbecility.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo, Victor, Choses vues, 18701885, Gallimard, 1972, p. 353, {{ISBN|2-07-036141-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

Well over one thousand musical compositions have been inspired by Hugo's works from the 19th century until the present day. In particular, Hugo's plays, in which he rejected the rules of classical theatre in favour of romantic drama, attracted the interest of many composers who adapted them into operas. More than one hundred operas are based on Hugo's works and among them are [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]'s ''[[Lucrezia Borgia (opera)|Lucrezia Borgia]]'' (1833), [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s {{lang|it|[[Rigoletto]]|nocat=y}} (1851) and ''[[Ernani]]'' (1844), and {{lang|it|[[Amilcare Ponchielli|Ponchielli]]|nocat=y}}'s {{lang|it|[[La Gioconda (opera)|La Gioconda]]|nocat=y}} (1876).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1981"&gt;"{{lang|fr|Hugo et la musique}}" in {{lang|fr|Pleins feux sur Victor Hugo}}, {{lang|fr|Arnaud Laster}}, {{lang|fr|[[Comdie-Franaise]]}} (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugo's novels, as well as his plays, have been a great source of inspiration for musicians, stirring them to create not only opera and ballet but musical theatre such as {{lang|fr|[[Notre-Dame de Paris (musical)|Notre-Dame de Paris]]}} and the ever-popular {{lang|fr|[[Les Misrables (musical)|Les Misrables]]}}, London [[West End of London|West End]]'s longest running musical. Additionally, Hugo's beautiful poems have attracted an exceptional amount of interest from musicians, and numerous melodies have been based on his poetry by composers such as {{lang|fr|Berlioz}}, {{lang|fr|[[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]}}, {{lang|fr|[[Gabriel Faur|Faur]]}}, {{lang|fr|[[Csar Franck|Franck]]}}, {{lang|fr|[[douard Lalo|Lalo]]}}, {{lang|fr|Liszt}}, {{lang|fr|[[Jules Massenet|Massenet]]}}, {{lang|fr|[[Camille Saint-Sans|Saint-Sans]]}}, [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], and {{lang|de|[[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]|nocat=y}}.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1981"/&gt;

Today, Hugo's work continues to stimulate musicians to create new compositions. For example, Hugo's novel against capital punishment, ''The Last Day of a Condemned Man'', was adapted into an opera by {{lang|fr|[[David Alagna]]}}, with a libretto by {{lang|fr|Frdrico Alagna}} and premired by their brother, tenor {{lang|fr|[[Roberto Alagna]]}}, in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-victorhugo-egaux.fr/Programme2008.htm |title=Festival Victor Hugo &amp; Egaux 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429182135/http://www.festival-victorhugo-egaux.fr/Programme2008.htm |archivedate=29 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Guernsey, every two years, the Victor Hugo International Music Festival attracts a wide range of musicians and the premiere of songs specially commissioned from such composers as {{lang|fr|[[Guillaume Connesson]]}}, {{lang|fr|[[Richard Dubugnon]]}}, {{lang|fr|[[Olivier Kaspar]]}}, and {{lang|fr|[[Thierry Escaich]]}} and based on Hugo's poetry.

Remarkably, not only Hugo's literary production has been the source of inspiration for musical works, but also his political writings have received attention from musicians and have been adapted to music. For instance, in 2009, Italian composer [[Matteo Sommacal]] was commissioned by Festival "Bagliori d'autore" and wrote a piece for speaker and chamber ensemble entitled ''Actes et paroles'', with a text elaborated by Chiara Piola Caselli after Victor Hugo's last political speech addressed to the Assemble lgislative, "Sur la Revision de la Constitution" (18 July 1851),&lt;ref&gt;V. Hugo, ''Actes et paroles: Avant l'exile, 1875'', [https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Discours_%C3%A0_l%E2%80%99Assembl%C3%A9e_l%C3%A9gislative_1849-1851 ''Discours  lAssemble lgislative 18491851''], J. Hetzel, Maison Quantin, Paris, 1875&lt;/ref&gt; and premiered in Rome on 19 November 2009, in the auditorium of the Institut franais, Centre Saint-Louis, French Embassy to the Holy See, by [[Piccola Accademia degli Specchi]] featuring the composer [[Matthias Kadar]].&lt;ref&gt;C.

When Hugo returned to Paris in 1870, the country hailed him as a national hero. He was confident that he would be offered the [[dictatorship]], as shown by the notes he kept at the time.  Dictatorship is a crime. This is a crime I am going to commit  but he felt he had to assume that responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Victor, Choses vues, 18701885, Gallimard, 1972, 2-07-036141-1, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his popularity, Hugo lost his bid for re-election to the National Assembly in 1872.

Throughout his life Hugo kept believing in unstoppable humanistic progress. In his last public address on 3 August 1879 he prophesied in an over-optimistic way, "In the twentieth century war will be dead, the scaffold will be dead, hatred will be dead, frontier boundaries will be dead, dogmas will be dead; man will live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1LzeAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA267&amp;lpg=PA267&amp;dq=%22La%20question%20sociale%20reste.%20Elle%20est%20terrible,%20mais%20elle%20est%20simple,%20c'est%20la%20question%20de%20ceux%20qui%20ont%20et%20de%20ceux%20qui%20n'ont%20pas%20!%20%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NF11SRsE24&amp;sig=vb_KqvopJBq3zFlvFCUlWddahO4&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwic36Kq67nSAhUGuRoKHQPEAr4Q6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22La%20question%20sociale%20reste.%20Elle%20est%20terrible,%20mais%20elle%20est%20simple,%20c'est%20la%20question%20de%20ceux%20qui%20ont%20et%20de%20ceux%20qui%20n'ont%20pas%20!%20%22&amp;f=false|title=La Fin de Satan: Nouvelle dition augmente|first=Hugo|last=Victor|date=18 February 2014|publisher=Arvensa editions|accessdate=3 April 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

Within a brief period, he suffered a mild [[stroke]], his daughter Adle was interned in an [[insane asylum]], and his two sons died. (Adle's biography inspired the movie ''[[The Story of Adele H.]]'') His wife Adle had died in 1868.

His faithful mistress, {{lang|fr|[[Juliette Drouet]]}}, died in 1883, only two years before his own death. Despite his personal loss, Hugo remained committed to the cause of political change. On 30 January 1876, he was elected to the newly created Senate. This last phase of his political career was considered a failure. Hugo was a maverick and achieved little in the Senate.

Hugo suffered a mild stroke on 27 June 1878.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, Graham ''Victor Hugo'' (1997) p. 506&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bandw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/vhugo.htm |title=Victor Hugo |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324184201/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/vhugo.htm |archivedate=24 March 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; To honour the fact that he was entering his 80th year, one of the greatest tributes to a living writer was held. The celebrations began on 25 June 1881, when Hugo was presented with a {{lang|fr|[[Manufacture nationale de Svres|Svres]]}} vase, the traditional gift for sovereigns. On 27 June, one of the largest parades in French history was held.

Marchers stretched from the {{lang|fr|Avenue d'Eylau}}, where the author was living, down the {{lang|fr|[[Champs-lyses]]}}, and all the way to the centre of Paris. The paraders marched for six hours past Hugo as he sat at the window at his house. Every inch and detail of the event was for Hugo; the official guides even wore cornflowers as an allusion to Fantine's song in ''Les Misrables''. On 28 June, the city of Paris changed the name of the Avenue d'Eylau to [[Avenue Victor-Hugo (Paris)|Avenue Victor-Hugo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://canadp-archivesenligne.paris.fr/images/vignettes/hugo.jpg {{lang|fr|Acte de dcs de Victor Hugo|nocat=y}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170743/http://canadp-archivesenligne.paris.fr/images/vignettes/hugo.jpg |date=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Letters addressed to the author were from then on labelled "To Mister Victor Hugo, In his avenue, Paris".

Two days before dying, he left a note with these last words: "To love is to act".

On 20 May 1885 [[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|''le Petit Journal'']] published the official medical bulletin on Hugos health condition. "The illustrious patient"  was fully conscious and aware that there was no hope for him. They also reported from a reliable source that at one point in the night he had whispered the following [[alexandrine]], " En moi, cest le combat du jour et de la nuit" -  "In me, this is the battle between day and night"&lt;ref&gt;Le Petit Journal (21 mai 1885), Gallica-BnF, http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k608676z.item&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Le Matin (France)|''Le Matin'']] published a slightly different version, "Here is the battle between day and night. 

Hugo's death from [[pneumonia]] on 22 May 1885, at the age of 83, generated intense national mourning. He was not only revered as a towering figure in literature, he was a statesman who shaped the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] and democracy in France. All his life he remained a defender of liberty, equality and fraternity as well as an adamant champion of French culture. In 1877, aged 75, he wrote, "I am not one of these sweet-tempered old men. I am still exasperated and violent. I shout and I feel indignant and I cry. Woe to anyone who harms France! I do declare I will die a fanatic patriot.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo, Victor, Choses vues 18701885, Gallimard, 1972, {{ISBN|2-07-036141-1}}, p. 411&lt;/ref&gt;"

Although he had requested a paupers funeral he was awarded a state funeral by decree of President [[Jules Grvy]]. More than two million people joined his funeral procession in Paris from the {{lang|fr|[[Arc de Triomphe]]}} to the {{lang|fr|[[Panthon]]}}, where he was buried. He shares a crypt within the {{lang|fr|Panthon}} with {{lang|fr|[[Alexandre Dumas]]}} and {{lang|fr|[[mile Zola]]}}. Most large French towns and cities have a street named after him.

Hugo left five sentences as his last will, to be officially published:

&lt;poem lang="fr" style="margin-left: 1em; font-style: italic;"&gt;
Je donne cinquante mille francs aux pauvres. Je veux tre enterr dans leur corbillard.
Je refuse l'oraison de toutes les glises. Je demande une prire  toutes les mes.
Je crois en Dieu.
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem style="margin-left: 1em;"&gt;
"I leave 50,000 francs to the poor. I wish to be buried in their hearse.
I refuse [funeral] orations from all Churches. I ask all souls for a prayer.
I believe in God."
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Drawings==
Hugo produced more than 4,000 drawings. Originally pursued as a casual hobby, drawing became more important to Hugo shortly before his exile when he made the decision to stop writing to devote himself to politics. Drawing became his exclusive creative outlet between 1848 and 1851.

Hugo worked only on paper, and on a small scale; usually in dark brown or black [[pen and ink|pen-and-ink]] wash, sometimes with touches of white, and rarely with colour. The surviving drawings are surprisingly accomplished and "modern" in their style and execution, foreshadowing the experimental techniques of [[Surrealism]] and [[Abstract expressionism]].

He would not hesitate to use his children's stencils, ink blots, puddles and stains, lace impressions, "{{lang|fr|pliage}}" or folding (e.g. Rorschach blots), "{{lang|fr|grattage}}" or rubbing, often using the charcoal from matchsticks or his fingers instead of pen or brush. Sometimes he would even toss in coffee or soot to get the effects he wanted. It is reported that Hugo often drew with his left hand or without looking at the page, or during [[Spiritist]] [[sance]]s, to access his [[unconscious mind]], a concept only later popularised by [[Sigmund Freud]].

Hugo kept his artwork out of the public eye, fearing it would overshadow his literary work. However, he enjoyed sharing his drawings with his family and friends, often in the form of ornately handmade calling cards, many of which were given as gifts to visitors when he was in political exile. Some of his work was shown to, and appreciated by, contemporary artists such as [[Vincent van Gogh|van Gogh]] and {{lang|fr|[[Eugne Delacroix|Delacroix]]}}; the latter expressed the opinion that if Hugo had decided to become a painter instead of a writer, he would have outshone the artists of their century.

== Victor Hugo and women ==
=== Wife ===
Hugo married [[Adle Foucher]] in October 1822. They lived together for nearly 46 years until she died in August 1868. Hugo, who was still banished from France, was unable to attend her funeral in Villequier where their daughter [[Lopoldine Hugo|Lopoldine]] was buried.  From 1830 to 1837 Adle had an affair with [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve|Charles-Augustin Sainte Beuve]], a reviewer and writer.&lt;ref&gt;
Foucher-Hugo Adle, Victor Hugo racont par Adle Hugo, Plon, 1985, 861 p., {{ISBN|2259012884}}, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mistresses ===
==== [[Juliette Drouet]] ====
From February 1833 until her death in 1883, Juliette Drouet devoted her whole life to Victor Hugo, who never married her even after his wife died in 1868. He took her on his numerous trips and she followed him in exile on [[Guernsey]]. There Hugo rented a house for her near [[Hauteville House]], his family home. She wrote some 20,000 letters in which she expressed her passion or vented her jealousy on her womanizing lover.&lt;ref&gt;Guillemin, Henri, ''Hugo'', Seuil, 1978, 191 p.  {{ISBN|2020000016}}, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;
On 25 September 1870 during the [[Siege of Paris (187071)|Siege of Paris]] (19 September 187028 January 1871) Hugo feared the worst. He left his children a note reading as follows :

"J.D.
She saved my life in December 1851. For me she underwent exile. Never has her soul forsaken mine. Let those who have loved me love her. Let those who have loved me respect her.
She is my widow."
V.H&lt;ref&gt;Seghers, Pierre, ''Victor Hugo visionnaire'', Robert Laffont, 95 p., {{ISBN|2221010442}}, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== [[Lonie dAunet]] ====
For more than seven years, Lonie dAunet, who was a married woman, was involved in a love relationship with Hugo. Both were caught in adultery on 5 July 1845. Hugo, who had been a Member of the [[Chamber of Peers (France)|Chamber of Peers]] since April, avoided condemnation whereas his mistress had to spend two months in prison and six in a convent. Many years after their separation, Hugo made a point of supporting her financially.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo, Victor, Choses vues 18491885, Gallimard, 1972, 1014 pp., {{ISBN|2070402177}}, p. 857 (17 Sept. 1876)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Casual affairs ===
Hugo gave free rein to his sensuality until a few weeks before his death. He sought a wide variety of women of all ages, be they courtesans, actresses, prostitutes, admirers, servants or revolutionaries like [[Louise Michel]] for sexual activity. Both a [[graphomania]]c and [[erotomania]]c, he systematically reported his casual affairs using his own code, as [[Samuel Pepys]] did, to make sure they would remain secret.  For instance, he resorted to Latin abbreviations (''osc.'' for kisses) or to Spanish (''Misma. Mismas cosas'' : The same. Same things). Homophones are frequent : ''Seins'' (Breasts) becomes Saint; ''Pole'' (Stove) actually refers to ''Poils'' (Pubic hair). Analogy also enabled him to conceal the real meaning: A womans ''Suisses'' (Swiss) are her breasts  due to the fact that Switzerland is renowned for its milk. After a rendez-vous with a young woman named ''Laetitia'' he would write ''Joie'' (Happiness) in his diary. If he added ''t.n.'' (''toute nue'') he meant she stripped naked in front of him. The initials ''S.B.'' discovered in November 1875 may  refer to [[Sarah Bernhardt]].&lt;ref&gt;Hugo, Victor, Choses vues 18701885, 529 p., {{ISBN|2070361411}}, pp. 371, 521 (n. 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

The people of [[Guernsey]] erected a statue by sculptor {{lang|fr|[[Jean Boucher (artist)|Jean Boucher]]}} in Candie Gardens ([[Saint Peter Port]]) to commemorate his stay in the islands. The City of Paris has preserved his residences [[Hauteville House]], [[Guernsey]] and {{lang|fr|6, Place des Vosges}}, Paris as museums. The house where he stayed in [[Vianden]], Luxembourg, in 1871 has also become a commemorative museum.

Hugo is venerated as a [[saint]] in the Vietnamese religion of {{lang|vi|[[Cao i]]|nocat=y}}, in the front hall of the Holy See in [[Ty Ninh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoskins |first=Janet Alison |year=2015 |title=The Divine Eye and the Diaspora: Vietnamese Syncretism Becomes Transpacific Caodaism |pages=2, 10, 3637, 99103, 18990 |isbn=978-0-8248-5140-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/caodaism.htm |title=Caodaism: A Vietnamese-centred religion |accessdate=8 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{lang|fr|[[Avenue Victor-Hugo (Paris)|Avenue Victor-Hugo]]}} in the [[16th arrondissement of Paris]] bears Hugo's name and links the {{lang|fr|[[Place de l'toile]]}} to the vicinity of the {{lang|fr|[[Bois de Boulogne]]}} by way of the {{lang|fr|Place Victor-Hugo}}. This square is served by a [[Paris Mtro]] [[Victor Hugo (Paris Mtro)|stop]] also named in his honour. In the town of [[Bziers]] there is a main street, a school, hospital and several cafs named after Hugo, and a number of streets and avenues throughout France are named after him. The school {{lang|fr|Lyce Victor Hugo}} was founded in his town of birth, {{lang|fr|[[Besanon]]}} in France. {{lang|fr|Avenue Victor-Hugo}}, located in [[Shawinigan]], Quebec, was named to honour him.

In the city of {{lang|it|[[Avellino]]|nocat=y}}, Italy, Victor Hugo lived briefly stayed in what is now known as {{lang|it|Il Palazzo Culturale|nocat=y}} when reuniting with his father, {{lang|fr|Leopold Sigisbert Hugo}}, in 1808. Hugo would later write about his brief stay here, quoting {{lang|fr|"C'tait un palais de marbre..."}} ("It was a palace of [[marble]]").

In [[Havana]], Cuba there is a park named after him and bust of Hugo stands near the entrance of the [[Old Summer Palace]] in Beijing.

A [[mosaic]] commemorating Hugo is located on the ceiling of the [[Thomas Jefferson Building]] of the [[Library of Congress]].

The [[London and North Western Railway]] named a 'Prince of Wales' Class 4-6-0 No 1134 after Hugo. [[British Rail]]ways perpetuated this memorial, naming Class 92 Electric Unit 92001 after him.

==Religious veneration==
Thanks to his contribution to mankind, his virtues, and belief in God, he is venerated as a saint in {{lang|vi|[[Cao i]]|nocat=y}}, a new religion established in Vietnam in 1926. According to religious records, he was assigned by God to lead the foreign mission as part of God's Divine hierarchy. He represented mankind, along with the major Saints [[Sun Yat-sen]] and {{lang|vi|[[Nguyn Bnh Khim|Trng Trnh Nguyn Bnh Khim]]|nocat=y}}, to sign a religious pact with God, promising to lead mankind to "Love and Justice" ("Amour et Justice").

Here is an excerpt of his teaching about heaven:

&lt;poem style="margin-left: 1em;"&gt;
In all heavens, beauty reigns,
Its beings possess much of divinity.
Peace and harmony rule these realms,
Their beings know not the word 'war'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gobron |first1=Gabriel |title=History and Philosophy of Vietnam |publisher=Wildside Press |isbn=1434462846 |page=53 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=19i7DcE6_XAC&amp;pg=PA42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
