==Career==
===19891997: Career beginnings===
When Nolan's family relocated to Chicago during his formative years, he started making films with Adrien and [[Roko Belic]]. He has continued his collaboration with the brothers, receiving a credit for his editorial assistance on their Oscar-nominated documentary ''[[Genghis Blues]]'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicdoc.se/genghis-blues|title=Genghis Blues|publisher=Musicdoc.se|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nolan also worked alongside Belic (and future [[Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting|Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[Jeffrey Gettleman]]) on documenting a safari across four African countries, organized by the late photojournalist [[Dan Eldon]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan, Graydon (2013), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amy-eldon-turteltaub/dan-eldon_b_3582633.html|title=Remembering My Brother Dan Eldon: A Journalist Who Died To Tell the Story|publisher=Huffingtonpost|date=7 December 2013|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nolan was educated at [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]], an independent school in [[Hertford Heath]], [[Hertfordshire]], and later read [[English literature]] at [[University College London]] (UCL). He chose UCL specifically for its filmmaking facilities, which comprised a [[Steenbeck|Steenbeck editing suite]] and [[16 mm film#Cameras|16{{nbsp}}mm film cameras]].&lt;ref name="Tempest"&gt;Tempest, M. [https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/feb/24/inception-christopher-nolan-film-oscar-director "I was there at the 'Inception' of Christopher Nolan's film career"], ''The Guardian'', 24 February 2011; retrieved 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Nolan was president of the Union's Film Society,&lt;ref name="Tempest"/&gt; and with [[Emma Thomas]] (his girlfriend and future wife) he screened [[35 mm]] feature films during the school year and used the money earned to produce [[16 mm]] films over the summers.&lt;ref name="British Cinematographer pt2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wally Pfister ASC on Christopher Nolan's Inception|url=http://www.thecinematographer.info/articles/18-wally-pfister.html|work=thecinematographer.info|year=2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411005825/http://www.thecinematographer.info/articles/18-wally-pfister.html|archivedate=11 April 2012|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his college years, Nolan made two short films. The first was the [[surrealism|surreal]] [[Super 8 film|8{{nbsp}}mm]] ''Tarantella'' (1989), which was shown on ''Image Union'' (an independent film and video showcase on the [[Public Broadcasting Service]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nextwavefilms.com/following/index.html#background|title=The Filmmakers|publisher=Next Wave Films|date=21 November 1999|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second was ''Larceny'' (1995), filmed over a weekend in black and white with limited equipment and a small cast and crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1052|title=Christopher Nolan: The Movies. The Memories |work=Empire|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funded by Nolan and shot with the society's equipment, it appeared at the [[Cambridge Film Festival]] in 1996 and is considered one of UCL's best shorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uczxflm/productions/archive/9495|title=UCLU Film Society, London|publisher=Ucl.ac.uk|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After earning his  bachelor's degree in English literature in 1993, Nolan worked as a [[Script analyst|script reader]], [[camera operator]], and director of [[corporate video]]s and [[Sponsored film|industrial films]].&lt;ref name="Tempest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feinberg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b81581f07|title=Fearville (1997)|publisher=BFI|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also made a third short, ''[[Doodlebug (film)|Doodlebug]]'' (1997), about a man chasing an insect around a flat with a shoe, only to discover when killing it that it is a miniature of himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/07/christopher-nolan-doodlebug-first-film-jeremy-theobald-1201706870|title=Christopher Nolans First Released Short Film Doodlebug: Watch His Twisted 1997 Debut |publisher=IndieWire}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period in his career, Nolan had little or no success getting his projects off the ground; he later recalled the "stack of rejection letters" that greeted his early forays into making films, adding "there's a very limited pool of finance in the UK. To be honest, it's a very clubby kind of place&amp;nbsp;... Never had any support whatsoever from the British film industry."&lt;ref name="AndrewPulver05"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/jun/15/features.features11|title=He's not a god - he's human|last=Pulver|first=Andrew|date=15 June 2005|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19982004: Breakthrough===
In 1998 Nolan directed his first feature, ''[[Following]]'', which he personally funded and filmed with friends.&lt;ref name="Ressner"/&gt; It depicts an unemployed young writer ([[Jeremy Theobald]]) who trails strangers through London, hoping they will provide material for his first novel, but is drawn into a criminal underworld when he fails to keep his distance. The film was inspired by Nolan's experience of living in London and having his flat burgled: "There is an interesting connection between a stranger going through your possessions and the concept of following people at random through a crowd{{snd}}both take you beyond the boundaries of ordinary [[social relations]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.ucl.ac.uk/display/SLAISFAlumni/Christopher+Nolan|title=The Man behind the Mask|publisher=UCL|date=8 December 2008|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Following'' was made on a modest budget of 3,000, and was shot on weekends over the course of a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/interviews/39-christopher-nolan "Interview with Christopher Nolan"].

As a result of ''Following''{{'}}s success, Nolan was afforded the opportunity to make his breakthrough hit ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' (2000). During a road trip from Chicago to Los Angeles, his brother Jonathan pitched the idea for "''[[Memento Mori (short story)|Memento Mori]]''", about a man with [[anterograde amnesia]] who uses notes and tattoos to hunt for his wife's murderer. Nolan developed a screenplay that told the story in reverse; Aaron Ryder, an executive for [[Newmarket Films]], said it was "perhaps the most innovative script I had ever seen".&lt;ref&gt;Mottram, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was optioned and given a budget of $4.5{{nbsp}}million.&lt;ref&gt;Mottram, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Memento'', starring [[Guy Pearce]] and [[Carrie-Anne Moss]], premiered in September 2000 at the [[Venice International Film Festival]] to critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;Mottram, p. 6264.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Morgenstern]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote in his review, "I can't remember when a movie has seemed so clever, strangely affecting and slyly funny at the very same time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hero With No Memory Turns 'Memento' Into Unforgettable Trip|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB9846986937127287 |publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=21 January 2014|first=Joe|last=Morgenstern}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basil Smith, in the book ''The Philosophy of Neo-Noir'', draws a comparison with [[John Locke]]'s ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', which argues that conscious memories constitute our identities, a theme that Nolan explores in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Conard (2007) p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a box-office success&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memento|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=memento.htm|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received a number of accolades, including [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)|Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Golden Globe Award]] nominations for its screenplay, [[Independent Spirit Award]]s for [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]], and a [[Directors Guild of America]] (DGA) Award nomination.&lt;ref name="nytimesawards"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/240025/Christopher-Nolan/awards|title=Christopher Nolan awards|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp;jsessionid=85089250F8C40E42B36D0F921E3F7860?curTime=1295947194337 Session Timeout  Academy Awards Database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105194451/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp%3Bjsessionid%3D85089250F8C40E42B36D0F921E3F7860?curTime=1295947194337 |date=5 November 2013 }} (29 January 2010); retrieved 26 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Memento'' was considered by numerous critics to be one of the best films of the [[2000s in film|2000s]].&lt;ref name="Metadecade"&gt;{{cite web|title=Film Critics Pick the Best Movies of the Decade|url=http://www.metacritic.com/feature/film-critics-pick-the-best-movies-of-the-decade|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=4 September 2012|date=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the film was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]], being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/the-goonies-titanic-field-of-dreams-die-hard-national-film-registry-1202638298/ |title=Titanic, The Goonies, Field of Dreams, Memento Added to National Film Registry |publisher=Variety |date=13 December 2017 |accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Impressed by his work on ''Memento'', [[Steven Soderbergh]] recruited Nolan to direct the [[psychological thriller]] ''[[Insomnia (2002 film)|Insomnia]]'' (2002), starring Academy Award winners [[Al Pacino]], [[Robin Williams]], and [[Hilary Swank]].&lt;ref name="insomnia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/interview/cnolan|title='Memento' recognition landed Christopher Nolan in the director's chair for big-budget 'Insomnia'|accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warner Bros.]] initially wanted a more seasoned director, but Soderbergh and his [[Section Eight Productions]] fought for Nolan, as well as his choice of cinematographer ([[Wally Pfister]]) and editor ([[Dody Dorn]]).&lt;ref&gt;deWaard, Tait (2013), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; With a $46{{nbsp}}million budget, it was described as "a much more conventional Hollywood film than anything the director has done before".&lt;ref name="insomnia"/&gt; A remake of the 1997 [[Insomnia (1997 film)|Norwegian film of the same name]], ''Insomnia'' is about two Los Angeles detectives sent to a northern Alaskan town to investigate the murder of a local teenager.

After ''Insomnia'', Nolan planned a [[Howard Hughes]] biographical film starring [[Jim Carrey]]. He penned a screenplay, which he said was "the best script I've ever written", but when he learned that [[Martin Scorsese]] was making a Hughes biopic (2004's ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]''), he reluctantly tabled his script and moved on to other projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2014/11/christopher-nolan-talks-howard-hughes-project-interstellar-more-in-interviews-plus-featurettes-new-pics-more-270480/|title=Christopher Nolan Talks Howard Hughes Project, 'Interstellar' &amp; More In Interviews, Plus Featurettes, New Pics &amp; More|publisher=''Indiewire''|date=10 November 2014|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/christopher-nolan-says-his-howard-hughes-film-is-dead-but-hed-still-like-to-do-a-bond-film-at-some-point-20120604|title=Christopher Nolan Says His Howard Hughes Film Is Dead, But He'd Still Like To Do A Bond Film at Some Point|publisher=''Indiewire''|accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After turning down an offer to direct the historical epic ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]'' (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/trivia-when-christopher-nolan-first-came-to-warner-bros-he-was-offered-troy-to-direct-20130621|title=Trivia: When Christopher Nolan First Came To Warner Bros., He Was Offered 'Troy' To Direct|publisher=The Playlist|accessdate=12 August 2014|first=Kevin|last=Jagernauth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nolan worked on adapting [[Ruth Rendell]]'s crime novel ''[[The Keys to the Street]]'' into a screenplay that he planned to direct for [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], but eventually left the project, citing the similarities to his previous films.&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;[http://theplaylist.net/gemma-arterton-to-star-in-christopher-20100906/ Gemma Arterton to star in Christopher Nolan-penned thriller 'The Keys to the Street', Meeting with Ridley Scott for 'Alien' prequels'] ''The Playlist'', 9 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===20052013: Mainstream and critical success===
In early 2003 Nolan approached Warner Bros. with the idea of making a new [[Batman]] film. Fascinated by the character and story, he wanted to make a film grounded in a "relatable" world more reminiscent of a classical drama than a comic-book fantasy.&lt;ref name="bb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmcomment.com/article/cinematic-faith-christopher-nolan-scott-foundas|title=Christopher Nolan looks back over the Dark Knight trilogy in this extended interview|publisher=Filmcomment|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Batman Begins]]'', the biggest project Nolan had undertaken to that point,&lt;ref name="bb"/&gt; premiered in June 2005 to critical acclaim and commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insomnia|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_begins/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starring [[Christian Bale]] in the title role, along with [[Michael Caine]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Morgan Freeman]], and [[Liam Neeson]], the film revived the franchise, heralding a trend towards darker films that [[reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] (or retold) backstories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/06/the-complicated-legacy-of-batman-begins/395477/|title=The Complicated Legacy of Batman Begins|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shawn Adler|title=He-Man' Movie Will Go Realistic: 'We're Not Talking About Putting Nipples On The Trapjaw Suit|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/08/14/he-man-movie-will-go-realistic-were-not-talking-about-putting-nipples-on-the-trapjaw-suit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080902155525/http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/08/14/he-man-movie-will-go-realistic-were-not-talking-about-putting-nipples-on-the-trapjaw-suit|archivedate=2 September 2008|date=14 August 2008|accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It tells the [[origin story]] of the character from Bruce Wayne's initial [[fear of bats]], the death of his parents, his journey to become Batman, and his fight against [[Ra's al Ghul]]'s plot to destroy [[Gotham City]].

The phrase "dark and gritty" likewise joined the cinematic lexicon, influencing our perception of different approaches to storytelling not only in the comic book film genre but in all sorts of other genres as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/2015/07/30/exclusive-christopher-nolan-talks-batman-begins-10th-anniversary/#797eaf2329a0|title=Exclusive: Christopher Nolan Talks 'Batman Begins' 10th Anniversary|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before returning to the Batman franchise, Nolan directed, co-wrote, and produced ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' (2006), an adaptation of the [[Christopher Priest (novelist)|Christopher Priest]] [[The Prestige|novel]] about two rival 19th-century magicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christopher-priest.co.uk/books/the-prestige/interview-abou-the-prestige|title=Interview about The Prestige|publisher=Christopher-priest.co.uk|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, when Nolan was in [[post-production]] for ''Insomnia'', he asked his brother Jonathan to help write the script for the film.

During the year-long production of his first film, ''Following'' (1998), Nolan and Thomas hired a small sailing boat to take them across the [[English Channel]] and retrace the journey of the [[little ships of Dunkirk]]. "We did it at the same time of year to get a sense of what it was like, and it turned out to be an incredibly dangerous experience. And that was with no bombs dropping on us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dga.org/Craft/DGAQ/All-Articles/1703-Summer-2017/WWII-Dunkirk.aspx|title=WWII on a Grand Scale|work=DGA|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''Dunkirk'', Nolan said he was inspired by the work of [[Robert Bresson]], silent films such as ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916) and ''[[Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans]]'' (1927), as well as by ''[[The Wages of Fear]]'' (1953).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thefilmstage.com/news/christopher-nolan-inspired-by-robert-bresson-and-silent-films-for-dunkirk-which-has-little-dialogue/|title=Christopher Nolan Inspired by Robert Bresson and Silent Films for 'Dunkirk,' Which Has "Little Dialogue"|work=The Film Stage|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the film as a survival tale with a [[triptych]] structure, he wanted to make a "sensory, almost experimental movie" with minimal dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiere.fr/Cinema/News-Cinema/EXCLU-Christopher-Nolan-et-ses-collaborateurs-revelent-7-infos-sur-Dunkerque|title=Christopher Nolan et ses collaborateurs rvlent 7 infos sur Dunkerque|work=Premire|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nolan said he waited to make ''Dunkirk'' until he had earned the trust of a major studio to let him make it as a British film, but with an American budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2017/07/08/spitfires-flotillas-boats-rough-seas-1000-extras-christopher/|title=Spitfires, flotillas of boats, rough seas and 1,000 extras: Christopher Nolan on the making of Dunkirk, his most challenging film to date|last=Nolan|first=Christopher|work=The Telegraph|date=8 July 2017|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before filming, Nolan also sought advice from Spielberg, who later said in an interview with ''Variety'', "Knowing and respecting that Chris [Nolan] is one of the world's most imaginative filmmakers, my advice to him was to leave his imagination, as I did on [[Saving Private Ryan|''Ryan'']], in second position to the research he was doing to authentically acquit this historical drama."&lt;ref name="LangVariety"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/christopher-nolan-dunkirk-oscars-movies-tv-spielberg-1202607836/|title=Christopher Nolan Gets Candid on the State of Movies, Rise of TV and Spielberg's Influence|last=Lang|first=Brent|date=8 November 2017|work=Variety|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starring [[Fionn Whitehead]], [[Jack Lowden]], [[Aneurin Barnard]], [[Harry Styles]], [[Tom Hardy]], [[Mark Rylance]], [[Cillian Murphy]], and [[Kenneth Branagh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/harry-styles-one-direction-christopher-nolan-dunkirk-1201728153|title=Harry Styles, Fionn Whitehead to Star in Christopher Nolan WW2 Action-Thriller Dunkirk|last=McNary|first=Dave|work=Variety|date=11 March 2016|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dunkirk'' was released in theaters on 21{{nbsp}}July 2017 to widespread critical acclaim and strong box office results,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/dunkirk-review-roundup-what-critics-are-saying-1021889|title='Dunkirk': What the Critics Are Saying|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=17 July 2017|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dunkirk Reviews  Metacritic|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dunkirk/critic-reviews|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/07/dunkirk-success-christopher-nolan|title=How Dunkirk, Summer's Boldest Box-Office Gamble, Paid Off|publisher=''Vanity Fair''|date=24 July 2017|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; grossing over $525{{nbsp}}million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing World War{{nbsp}}II film of all time.

In the months following the [[Oscar season]], Nolan began supervising a new 70mm print of [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968), made from the [[original camera negative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-christopher-nolan-2001-20180503-story.html|title=Christopher Nolan restores Kubrick sci-fi masterpiece '2001: A Space Odyssey' the old-fashioned way|publisher=''Los Angeles Times''|date=3 May 2018|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He presented the film at the [[2018 Cannes Film Festival]], with members of Kubrick's family in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2018/03/christopher-nolan-cannes-stanley-kubrick-space-odyssey-2001-1202354670/|title=Cannes: Christopher Nolan To Present 70mm Print Of Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey'|publisher=''Deadline''|date=28 March 2018|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Cannes, Nolan also held a two-hour masterclass at the [[Palais des Festivals et des Congrs|Palais des Festivals]].

Aesthetically, the director favours deep, evocative shadows, documentary-style lighting, natural settings, and [[location shooting|real filming locations]] over studio work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/07/the-reason-christopher-nolan-films-look-like-christopher-nolan-films/260087/|title=The Reason Christopher Nolan Films Look Like Christopher Nolan Films|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nolan has noted that many of his films are heavily influenced by [[film noir]].&lt;ref name="Bevan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/sightsound/christopher-nolan-escape-artist|title=Christopher Nolan: escape artist|last=Bevan|first=Joseph|date=18 July 2012|work=BFI|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has continuously experimented with [[Metafiction|metafictive elements]], [[Time|temporal]] shifts, elliptical cutting, [[Solipsism|solipsistic perspectives]], [[Nonlinear narrative|nonlinear storytelling]], [[labyrinth]]ine plots, and the merging of style and form.&lt;ref name="Bevan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leftfield"&gt;{{cite web|title=Analysis: The Films of Christopher Nolan|url=http://www.leftfieldcinema.com/analysis-the-films-of-christopher-nolan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128045314/http://leftfieldcinema.com/analysis-the-films-of-christopher-nolan|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 January 2011|work=Left Field Cinema|accessdate=23 December 2013|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bordwell2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/08/19/nolan-vs-nolan/|title=Nolan vs. Nolan|last=Bordwell|first=David|date=19 August 2012|publisher=Observations on film art|accessdate=25 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208152024/http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2012/08/19/nolan-vs-nolan/|archivedate=8 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing ''[[The Tree of Life (film)|The Tree of Life]]'' (2011), Nolan spoke of [[Terrence Malick]]'s work and how it has influenced his own approach to style, "When you think of a visual style, when you think of the visual language of a film, there tends to be a natural separation of the visual style and the narrative elements. But with the greats, whether it's Stanley Kubrick or Terrence Malick or [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]], what you're seeing is an inseparable, a vital relationship between the image and the story it's telling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ropeofsilicon.com/nolan-fincher-discuss-malick-tree-life-featurette/|title=Nolan and Fincher Discuss Malick in New 'Tree of Life' Featurette|publisher=Fox Searchlight via Ropeofsilicon|accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Memento Timeline.png|thumb|left|upright|A map showing the structure of ''Memento'' (2000)]]

Drawing attention to the intrinsically manipulative nature of the medium, Nolan uses narrative and stylistic techniques (notably [[mise en abyme]] and [[recursion]]s) to stimulate the viewer to ask themselves why his films are put together in such ways and why the films provoke particular responses.&lt;ref name="Film-philosophy"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Therapeutic Philosophy of Christopher Nolan|url=http://www.film-philosophy.com/conference/index.php/conf/2012/paper/view/257|work=Film-Philosophy Conference|accessdate=31 January 2014|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sometimes uses editing as a way to represent the characters' psychological states, merging their subjectivity with that of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://narrativeinart.wordpress.com/nolan|title=Nolan and Narrative|work=Narrative in Art|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''Memento'' the fragmented sequential order of scenes is to put the audience into a similar experience of Leonard's defective ability to create new long-term memories. In ''The Prestige'', the series of magic tricks and themes of duality and deception mirror the structural narrative of the film.&lt;ref name="Bevan"/&gt; His writing style incorporates a number of [[literary technique|storytelling techniques]] such as [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], shifting points of view, and [[unreliable narrator]]s. Scenes are often interrupted by the unconventional editing style of cutting away quickly from the [[money shot]] (or nearly cutting off characters' dialogue) and [[crosscutting]] several scenes of parallel action to build to a climax.&lt;ref name="Bevan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/christopher-nolan,13769|title=Interview: Christopher Nolan|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''Dunkirk'', Nolan structured the three different timelines to emulate a [[shepard tone]] in such a way that it "provides a continual feeling of intensity".&lt;ref name="ZimmerNolan"/&gt; In 2017 noted [[film theory|film theorist]] and [[film historian|historian]] [[David Bordwell]] wrote about Nolan's fascination with subjective storytelling and crosscutting: "It's rare to find any mainstream director so relentlessly focused on exploring a particular batch of storytelling techniques{{nbsp}}... Nolan zeroes in, from film to film, on a few narrative devices, finding new possibilities in what most directors handle routinely. He seems to me a very thoughtful, almost theoretical director in his fascination with turning certain conventions this way and that, to reveal their unexpected possibilities."&lt;ref name="BordwellDunkirk"&gt;{{cite web|title=DUNKIRK Part 2: The art film as event movie|url=http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2017/08/09/dunkirk-part-2-the-art-film-as-event-movie/|work=Observations on film art|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nolan has also stressed the importance of establishing a clear [[Narrative mode|point of view]] in his films, and makes frequent use of "the shot that walks into a room behind a character, because{{nbsp}}... that takes [the viewer] inside the way that the character enters".&lt;ref name="Ressner"/&gt; On narrative perspective, Nolan has said, "You don't want to be hanging above the [[maze]] watching the characters make the wrong choices because it's frustrating. You actually want to be in the maze with them, making the turns at their side."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/04/entertainment/la-ca-inception4-2010apr04/3|title='Inception' breaks into dreams|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nolan has also used [[cinma-vrit]] techniques (such as hand-held camera work) to convey realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcinematographer.co.uk/articles/24-robert-richardson-asc-on.html |title=Collaboration is king, Wally Pfister ASC and Christopher Nolan. |work=British Cinematographer |accessdate=29 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005005227/http://www.britishcinematographer.co.uk/articles/24-robert-richardson-asc-on.html |archivedate=5 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview at the [[Film Society of Lincoln Center]], he explained his emphasis on realism in ''The Dark Knight'' trilogy: "You try and get the audience to invest in cinematic reality. When I talk about reality in these films, it's often misconstrued as a direct reality, but it's really about a cinematic reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2012/12/dark-knight-director-christopher-nolan-discusses-keeping-batman-real|title='Dark Knight' Director Christopher Nolan Talks About Keeping Batman Real|work=BBC America|accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In collaboration with composer [[David Julyan]], Nolan's films featured slow and atmospheric scores with minimalistic expressions and [[ambient music|ambient]] textures. In the mid-2000s, starting with ''Batman Begins'', Nolan began working with [[Hans Zimmer]], who is known for integrating [[electronic music]] with traditional orchestral arrangements. With Zimmer, the soundscape in Nolan's films evolved into becoming increasingly more lush, kinetic and experimental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicalmpr.org/story/2015/05/05/christopher-nolan-music|title=The music of Christopher Nolan: From atmospheric to aggressive|work=Classical MPR|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the main theme from ''Inception'', which is derived from a slowed down version of [[Edith Piaf]]'s song [[Non, je ne regrette rien]].&lt;ref name="ZimmerNolan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Christopher Nolan explains the 'audio illusion' that created the unique music in 'Dunkirk'|url=http://nordic.businessinsider.com/dunkirk-music-christopher-nolan-hans-zimmer-2017-7?r=US&amp;IR=T|work=Business Insider|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2014's ''Interstellar'', Zimmer and Nolan wanted to move in a new direction: "The textures, the music, and the sounds, and the thing we sort of created has sort of seeped into other people's movies a bit, so it's time to reinvent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/interstellar-score-hans-zimmer-dark-knight-trilogy|title=Berlin: Hans Zimmer Talks Christopher Nolan's Interstellar and the Influence of the Dark Knight Trilogy Score on Blockbuster Filmmaking|work=Collider|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The score for ''Dunkirk'' was written to accommodate the [[auditory illusion]] of a Shepard tone. It was also based on a recording of Nolan's own [[pocket watch]], which he sent to Zimmer to be [[Synthesizer|synthesised]].&lt;ref name="ZimmerNolan"/&gt; Responding to some criticism over his "experimental" [[Audio mixing|sound mix]] for ''Interstellar'', Nolan said, "I've always loved films that approach sound in an impressionistic way and that is an unusual approach for a mainstream blockbuster ... I don't agree with the idea that you can only achieve clarity through dialogue. Clarity of story, clarity of emotions  I try to achieve that in a very layered way using all the different things at my disposal  picture and sound."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/17/interstellar-sound-christopher-nolan|title=Interstellar's sound 'right for an experimental film', says Nolan|work=The Guardian|accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nolan has described his filmmaking process as a combination of intuition and geometry. "I draw a lot of diagrams when I work. I do a lot of thinking about etchings by [[M. C.

I'll draw pictures and diagrams that illustrate the movement or the rhythm that I'm after."&lt;ref name="Cox"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox|first=Gordon|title=Christopher Nolan Says His Filmmaking Process a Combination of Intuition and Geometry|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/christopher-nolan-tribeca-film-festival-1201476250/|work=Variety|accessdate=21 April 2015|date=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] physicist and Nobel Laureate Kip Thorne compared Nolan's "deep" intuition to scientists such as [[Albert Einstein]], noting that the director intuitively grasped things non-scientists rarely understand.&lt;ref name="ThorneNolan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch Christopher Nolan and Kip Thorne Discuss the Physics of Interstellar|url=http://time.com/3602525/christopher-nolan-physics-interstellar-kip-thorne/|work=Time|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding his own decision-making of whether or not to start work on a project, the filmmaker has proclaimed a belief in the sincerity of his passion for something within the particular project in question as a basis for his selective thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtH6kiPbMBw|title=Christopher Nolan: The full interview - Newsnight - YouTube |publisher=BBC Newsnight |date=16 October 2015 |accessdate=10 October 2016 |at=Time:19:40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He prefers shooting on [[film stock|film]] to [[digital video]], and opposes the use of [[digital intermediate]]s and [[digital cinematography]], which he feels are less reliable than film and offer inferior image quality. In particular, the director advocates for the use of higher-quality, larger-format film stock such as [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic 35{{nbsp}}mm]], [[VistaVision]], [[70 mm film|65{{nbsp}}mm]], and [[IMAX]].&lt;ref name="Ressner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weintraub"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Weintraub|first=Steve|title=Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas Interview|publisher=Collider|date=25 March 2010|url=http://www.collider.com/2010/03/25/director-christopher-nolan-and-producer-emma-thomas-interview-inception-they-talk-3d-what-kind-of-cameras-they-used-pre-viz-wb-and-a-lot-more|accessdate=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nolan uses [[Multiple-camera setup|multi-camera]] for stunts and [[Single-camera setup|single-camera]] for all the dramatic action, from which he then watches [[dailies]] every night, saying, "Shooting single-camera means I've already seen every frame as it's gone through the [[Film gate|gate]] because my attention isn't divided to multi-cameras."&lt;ref name="Ressner"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ressner|first=Jeffrey|title=The Traditionalist|url=http://www.dga.org/Craft/DGAQ/All-Articles/1202-Spring-2012/DGA-Interview-Christopher-Nolan.aspx|work=DGA Quarterly|accessdate=22 August 2012|date=Spring 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When working with actors, Nolan prefers giving them the time to perform as many takes of a given scene as they want. "I've come to realize that the lighting and camera setups, the technical things, take all the time, but running another take generally only adds a couple of minutes{{nbsp}}... If an actor tells me they can do something more with a scene, I give them the chance, because it's not going to cost that much time. It can't all be about the technical issues."&lt;ref name="Ressner"/&gt; [[Gary Oldman]] praised the director for providing a relaxed atmosphere on set, adding, "I've never seen him raise his voice to anyone." He also observed that Nolan would give the actors space to "find things in the scene", and not just give direction for direction's sake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1055|title=Christopher Nolan: The Movies.

Nolan chooses to minimize the amount of [[computer-generated imagery]] for special effects in his films, preferring to use [[practical effects]] whenever possible, and only using CGI to enhance elements which he has photographed in camera. For instance, his films ''Batman Begins'', ''Inception'', and ''Interstellar'' featured 620, 500, and 850 visual-effects shots, respectively, which is considered minor when compared with contemporary visual-effects epics, which may have upwards of 1,500 to 2,000 VFX shots:&lt;ref name="trussell"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Russell|first=Terrence|title=How ''Inception''{{'}}s Astonishing Visuals Came to Life|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=20 July 2010|url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2010/07/inception-visual-effects|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I believe in an absolute difference between animation and photography. However sophisticated your computer-generated imagery is, if it's been created from no physical elements and you haven't shot anything, it's going to feel like animation. There are usually two different goals in a visual effects movie. One is to fool the audience into seeing something seamless, and that's how I try to use it. The other is to impress the audience with the amount of money spent on the spectacle of the visual effect, and that, I have no interest in".&lt;ref name="Ressner"/&gt;

Nolan shoots the entirety of his films with one unit, rather than using a [[second unit]] for action sequences. That way, Nolan keeps his personality and point of view in every aspect of the film. "If I don't need to be directing the shots that go in the movie, why do I need to be there at all? The screen is the same size for every shot{{nbsp}}... Many action films embrace a second unit taking on all of the action. For me, that's odd because then why did you want to do an action film?"&lt;ref name="Ressner"/&gt; A famously secretive filmmaker, Nolan is also known for his tight security on scripts, even going as far as telling the actors of ''The Dark Knight Rises'' the ending of the film verbally to avoid any leaks and also keeping the ''Interstellar'' plot secret from his composer Hans Zimmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304500404579126364005185556|title=Hollywood Steps Up Security to Keep Scripts Secret|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://batman-news.com/2011/03/27/gary-oldman-on-christopher-nolans-the-dark-knight-rises-secrecy|title=Gary Oldman on Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises secrecy, Tom Hardy|publisher=Batman-News|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/christopher-nolan-kept-interstellar-plot-secret-from-composer-hans-zimmer-1201153171/|title = Christopher Nolan Kept 'Interstellar' Plot Secret from Composer Hans Zimmer|website=variety.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The director deliberately works under a tight schedule during the early stages of the editing process, forcing himself and his editor to work more spontaneously. "I always think of editing as instinctive or impressionist. Not to think too much, in a way, and feel it more."&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt; Nolan also avoids using [[Temp track|temp music]] while cutting his films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2012/12/dark-knight-lee-smith-talks-about.html|title=Dark Knight: Lee Smith talks about Christopher Nolan|publisher=Flickering Myth|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nolan's work explores [[existential]], [[Ethics|ethical]], and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] themes such as subjective experience, distortion of memory, human morality, the nature of time, [[causality]], and construction of [[personal identity]].&lt;ref name="Parks"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://widescreenjournal.org/index.php/journal/article/viewFile/96/146|title=Identity Construction and Ambiguity in Christopher Nolan's Films|last=Parks|first=Erin Hill|date=June 2011|work=Widescreenjournal|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I'm fascinated by our subjective perception of reality, that we are all stuck in a very singular point of view, a singular perspective on what we all agree to be an objective reality, and movies are one of the ways in which we try to see things from the same point of view".&lt;ref name="FoundasInception"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theotherjournal.com/2012/04/17/bleakness-and-richness-christopher-nolan-on-human-nature|title=Bleakness and Richness: Christopher Nolan on Human Nature|work=The Other Journal|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic [[Tom Shone]] described Nolan's oeuvre as "epistemological thrillers whose protagonists, gripped by the desire for definitive answers, must negotiate mazy environments in which the [[truth]] is always beyond their reach."&lt;ref name="Shone2014"/&gt; In an essay titled "The rational wonders of Christopher Nolan", film critic [[Mike D'Angelo]] argues that the filmmaker is a [[Materialism|materialist]] dedicated to exploring the wonders of the natural world. "Underlying nearly every film he's ever made, no matter how fanciful, is his conviction that the universe can be explained entirely by physical processes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedissolve.com/features/exposition/820-the-rational-wonders-of-christopher-nolan/|title=The rational wonders of Christopher Nolan|work=The Dissolve|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the larger themes of [[corruption]] and conspiracy, his characters are often emotionally disturbed, obsessive, and morally ambiguous, facing the fears and anxieties of [[loneliness]], [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[jealousy]], and greed. By grounding "everyday neurosis{{snd}}our everyday sort of fears and hopes for ourselves" in a heightened reality, Nolan makes them more accessible to a universal audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ney|first=Jason|title=Dark Roots|url=http://filmnoirfoundation.org/noircitymag/Dark-Roots.pdf|newspaper=the Film Noir Foundation|date= Summer 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protagonists of Nolan's films are often driven by philosophical beliefs, and their fate is ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/film/5-major-defining-tropes-of-christopher-nolans-films.php |title=5 Major Defining Tropes of Christopher Nolan's Films |accessdate=8 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005213625/http://whatculture.com/film/5-major-defining-tropes-of-christopher-nolans-films.php |archivedate=5 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some of his films, the protagonist and antagonist are mirror images of each other, a point which is made to the protagonist by the antagonist. Through the clashing of ideologies, Nolan highlights the ambivalent nature of truth.&lt;ref name="Film-philosophy"/&gt; The director also uses his real-life experiences as an inspiration in his work, saying, "From a creative point of view, the process of growing up, the process of maturing, getting married, having kids, I've tried to use that in my work. I've tried to just always be driven by the things that were important to me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flavorwire.com/515239/theres-no-prescription-christopher-nolan-and-bennett-miller-on-influences-fatherhood-and-the-ending-of-inception|title="Theres No Prescription": Christopher Nolan and Bennett Miller on Influences, Fatherhood, and the Ending of Inception|work=Flavorwire|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''The Playlist'', Oliver Lyttelton singled out [[Parenting|parenthood]] as a signature theme in Nolan's work, adding; "the director avoids talking about his private life, but fatherhood has been at the emotional heart of almost everything he's made, at least from ''Batman Begins'' onwards (previous films, it should be said, pre-dated the birth of his kids)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/how-parenthood-is-at-the-heart-of-interstellar-other-christopher-nolan-films-20141111?page=1|title=How Parenthood Is At The Heart Of 'Interstellar' &amp; Other Christopher Nolan Films|work=The Playlist|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nolan's most prominent recurring theme is the concept of [[time]]. The director has identified that all of his films "have had some odd relationship with time, usually in just a structural sense, in that I have always been interested in the subjectivity of time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scpr.org/programs/the-frame/2014/11/10/40245/how-interstellar-is-christopher-nolans-family-film/|title=Christopher Nolan: 'Interstellar' is 'my most aggressive attempt' at a family blockbuster|publisher=Southern California Public Radio|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''Film Philosophy'', Emma Bell points out that the characters in ''Inception'' do not literally time-travel, "rather they escape time by being ''stricken'' in it{{snd}}building the delusion that time has not passed, and is not passing now. They feel time grievously: willingly and knowingly destroying their experience by creating multiple simultaneous existences."&lt;ref name="Film-philosophy"/&gt; In ''Interstellar'', Nolan explored the laws of physics as represented in Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]], identifying time as the film's antagonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukscreen.com/articles/interviews/christopher-nolan-i-want-the-audience-to-feel-my-movies-not-understand-them-4567/|title=Christopher Nolan: I want the audience to feel my movies not understand them|publisher=UkScreen|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reality]] is often an abstract and fragile concept in Nolan's work. Alec Price and M.{{nbsp}}Dawson of ''Left Field Cinema'' noted that the [[existential crisis]] of conflicted male figures "struggling with the slippery nature of identity" is a prevalent theme in Nolan's work. The actual (or objective) world is of less importance than the way in which we absorb and remember, and it is this created (or subjective) reality that truly matters. "It is solely in the mind and the heart where any sense of permanency or equilibrium can ever be found."&lt;ref name="Leftfield"/&gt; According to film theorist Todd McGowan, these "created realities" also reveal the ethical and political importance of creating fictions and falsehoods. Nolan's films typically deceive spectators about the events that occur and the motivations of the characters, but they do not abandon the idea of truth altogether. Instead, "They show us how truth must emerge out of the lie if it is not to lead us entirely astray." McGowan further argues that Nolan is the first filmmaker to devote himself entirely to the illusion of the medium, calling him a [[Hegel]]ian filmmaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://utpress.utexas.edu/index.php/books/mcgfic|title=The Fictional Christopher Nolan|publisher=University of Texas Press|accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also noted that [[retrocausality|retroactive causality]] populates many of Nolan's films.&lt;ref&gt;Eberl, Dunn (2017), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
[[File:Escher.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nolan has credited [[M. C. Escher]] as a major influence.]]

The filmmaker has often cited [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Graphic arts|graphic artist]] [[M. C. Escher]] as a major influence on his own work. "I'm very inspired by the prints of M.{{nbsp}}C.

Nolan's habit for employing non-linear storylines was particularly influenced by the [[Graham Swift]] novel ''[[Waterland (novel)|Waterland]]'', which he felt "did incredible things with parallel timelines, and told a story in different dimensions that was extremely coherent". He was also influenced by the visual language of the film ''[[Pink Floyd  The Wall]]'' (1982) and the structure of ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994), stating that he was "fascinated with what [[Quentin Tarantino|Tarantino]] had done".&lt;ref name="Ressner"/&gt; ''Inception'' was partly influenced by [[Dante Alighieri|Dante's]] ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/11/pl_inception_nolan/|title=Q&amp;A: Christopher Nolan on Dreams, Architecture, and Ambiguity|date=29 November 2010|publisher=Wired|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''Interstellar'', he mentioned a number of literary influences, including ''[[Flatland]]'' by [[Edwin Abbott Abbott]], ''[[The Wasp Factory]]'' by [[Iain Banks]], and [[Madeleine L'Engle]]'s ''[[A Wrinkle in Time]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/11/interstellar-murphs-library/|title=9 Easter Eggs From The Bookshelf In Interstellar|date=17 November 2014|publisher=Wired|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other influences Nolan has credited include figurative painter [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/video/2013/nov/26/christopher-nolan-how-francis-bacon-inspired-dark-knight-batman-trilogy-video|title=Christopher Nolan: how Francis Bacon inspired my Dark Knight Batman trilogy  video|year=2013|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], and authors [[Raymond Chandler]], [[James Ellroy]], [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]],&lt;ref name="Timberg"/&gt; and [[Charles Dickens]] (''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' was a major influence on ''The Dark Knight Rises'').&lt;ref&gt;Jesser, Pourroy (2012), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on the film industry==
Christopher Nolan is a vocal proponent of the continued use of [[film stock]], and prefers it over digital recording and projection formats, summing up his belief as, "I am not committed to film out of nostalgia. I am in favor of any kind of technical innovation but it needs to exceed what ''has'' gone before and so far nothing has exceeded anything that's come before".&lt;ref name="Deadline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/03/cinemacon-christopher-nolan-warns-theatre-owners-how-interstellar-is-presented-will-be-more-important-than-any-film-hes-done-before/ |title=CinemaCon: Christopher Nolan Warns Theatre Owners: How 'Interstellar' Is Presented Will Be More Important Than Any Film He's Done Before |work=Deadline|date=26 March 2014|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nolan's major concern is that the film industry's adoption of digital formats has been driven purely by economic factors as opposed to digital being a superior medium to film, saying, "I think, truthfully, it boils down to the economic interest of manufacturers and [a production] industry that makes more money through change rather than through maintaining the status quo."&lt;ref name="Ressner"/&gt;

Shortly before Christmas of 2011, Nolan invited several prominent directors, including, [[Edgar Wright]], [[Michael Bay]], [[Bryan Singer]], [[Jon Favreau]], [[Eli Roth]], [[Duncan Jones]], and [[Stephen Daldry]], to Universal CityWalk's IMAX theatre for a private screening of the first six minutes of ''The Dark Knight Rises'', which had been shot on IMAX film and edited from the [[original camera negative]]. Nolan used this screening in an attempt to showcase the superiority of the IMAX format over digital, and to warn the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, Hollywood movie studios would begin to phase out the use of film in favor of digital.&lt;ref name="Ressner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="filmvsdigital"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2012-04-12/film-tv/35-mm-film-digital-Hollywood|title=Movie Studios Are Forcing Hollywood to Abandon 35mm Film. But the Consequences of Going Digital Are Vast, and Troubling|work=LA Weekly|date=12 April 2012|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nolan explained, "I wanted to give them a chance to see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [on] film, they should say so. I felt as if I didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, it would be a shame. When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one."&lt;ref name="Ressner"/&gt; Nolan has lent out IMAX lenses from his personal collection to fellow directors to use on movies such as ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-imax-christopher-nolan-20170424-story.html|title=Imax embeds itself with Hollywood directors to make sure you see 'Dunkirk' and 'Transformers' on its screens|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nolan is also an advocate for the importance of films being shown in large-screen cinema theaters as opposed to home video formats, as he believes that, "The theatrical window is to the movie business what live concerts are to the music business{{snd}}and no one goes to a concert to be played an MP3 on a bare stage."&lt;ref name="WallStreet"/&gt; In 2014 Christopher Nolan wrote an article for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' where he expressed concern that as the film industry transitions away from photochemical film towards digital formats, the difference between seeing films in theaters versus on other formats will become trivialized, leaving audiences no incentive to seek out a theatrical experience. Nolan further expressed concern that with content digitized, theaters of the future will be able to track best-selling films and adjust their programming accordingly, a process that favors large heavily marketed studio films, but will marginalize smaller innovative and unconventional pictures. In order to combat this, Nolan believes the industry needs to focus on improving the theatrical experience with bigger and more beautiful presentation formats that cannot be accessed or reproduced in the home, as well as embracing the new generation of aspiring young innovative filmmakers.&lt;ref name="WallStreet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.wsj.com/articles/christopher-nolan-films-of-the-future-will-still-draw-people-to-theaters-1404762696 |title=Christopher Nolan: Films of the Future Will Still Draw People to Theaters|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=7 July 2014|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife, [[Emma Thomas]] has co-produced all of his films (including ''Memento'', in which she is credited as an associate producer). He regularly works with his brother, Jonathan Nolan (creator of ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]'' and ''[[Westworld (TV series)|Westworld]]''), who describes their working relationship in the production notes for ''The Prestige'': "I've always suspected that it has something to do with the fact that he's left-handed and I'm right-handed, because he's somehow able to look at my ideas and flip them around in a way that's just a little bit more twisted and interesting.
