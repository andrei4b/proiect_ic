'''Michael Jeffrey Jordan''' (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials, '''MJ''',&lt;ref&gt;Rein, Kotler and Shields, pg. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; is an American former professional [[basketball]] player who played 15 seasons in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) for the [[Chicago Bulls]] and [[Washington Wizards]]. His biography on the official NBA website states: "By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time."&lt;ref name="nbah"/&gt; Jordan was one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation and was considered instrumental in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Markovits and Rensman, pg. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently the principal owner and chairman of the NBA's [[Charlotte Hornets]].

Jordan played three seasons for coach [[Dean Smith]] at the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|University of North Carolina]]. As a freshman, he was a member of the [[198182 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|Tar Heels' national championship team]] in [[1982 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1982]]. Jordan joined the Bulls in [[198485 NBA season|1984]] as the [[1984 NBA draft|third overall]] [[draft (sports)|draft]] pick. He quickly emerged as a league star and entertained crowds with his prolific scoring. His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing [[slam dunk]]s from the [[free throw line]] in [[slam dunk contest]]s, earned him the nicknames '''Air Jordan''' and '''His Airness'''. He also gained a reputation for being one of the best defensive players in basketball.&lt;ref name="defensive players"/&gt; In [[1991 NBA Finals|1991]], he won his first NBA championship with the Bulls, and followed that achievement with titles in [[1992 NBA Finals|1992]] and [[1993 NBA Finals|1993]], securing a "[[three-peat]]". Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the beginning of the [[199394 NBA season]] and started a new career playing minor league [[baseball]], he returned to the Bulls in [[199495 NBA season|March 1995]] and led them to three additional championships in [[1996 NBA Finals|1996]], [[1997 NBA Finals|1997]], and [[1998 NBA Finals|1998]], as well as a then-record [[List of NBA teams by single season win percentage|72 regular-season wins]] in the 199596 NBA season. Jordan retired for a second time in [[199899 NBA season|January 1999]], but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Wizards.

Jordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include six [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals MVP Awards]], ten [[List of National Basketball Association annual scoring leaders|scoring titles]] (both all-time records), five [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Awards]], ten [[All-NBA Team|All-NBA]] First Team designations, nine [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-Defensive]] First Team honors, fourteen [[NBA All-Star Game]] appearances, three [[NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star Game MVP Awards]], three [[steal (basketball)|steals]] titles, and the 1988 [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]]. Among his numerous accomplishments, Jordan holds the NBA records for highest career regular season scoring average (30.12 points per game) and highest career playoff scoring average (33.45 points per game). In 1999, he was named the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century by [[ESPN]], and was second to [[Babe Ruth]] on the [[Associated Press]]'s list of athletes of the century. Jordan is a two-time inductee into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]], having been enshrined in 2009 for his individual career, and again in 2010 as part of the group induction of the [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team]] ("The Dream Team"). He became a member of the [[FIBA Hall of Fame]] in 2015.

Jordan is also known for his product endorsements. He fueled the success of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike's]] [[Air Jordan]] sneakers, which were introduced in 1985 and remain popular today.&lt;ref name="remain popular" /&gt; Jordan also starred as himself in the 1996 film ''[[Space Jam]]''. In 2006, he became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Bobcats; he bought a controlling interest in 2010. In 2015, Jordan became the first [[billionaire]] player in NBA history as a result of the increase in value of NBA franchises. He is the third-richest African-American, behind [[Robert F. Smith (investor)|Robert F. Smith]] and [[Oprah Winfrey]].

==Early years==
Jordan was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], to Deloris (ne Peoples), who worked in banking, and [[James R. Jordan Sr.]], an equipment supervisor. His family moved to [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], when he was a toddler.&lt;ref name="a toddler"/&gt;

Jordan is the fourth of five children. He has two older brothers, Larry Jordan and James R. Jordan, Jr., one older sister, Deloris, and one younger sister, Roslyn. Jordan's brother James retired in 2006 as the [[Sergeant Major|Command Sergeant Major]] of the [[35th Signal Brigade (United States)|35th Signal Brigade]] of the [[XVIII Airborne Corps (United States)|XVIII Airborne Corps]] in the U.S. Army.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [https://web.archive.org/web/20060529123711/http://www.charlotte.com/mld/observer/news/local/14588539.htm "Michael Jordan's big brother ends Army career"], charlotte.com, May 16, 2006. Retrieved May 9, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==High school career==
[[File:Michael Jordan - Laney High School 1980 - 02.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Jordan going in for a slam-dunk for the Laney High School varsity basketball team, 197980.]]
Jordan attended [[Emsley A. Laney High School]] in Wilmington, where he highlighted his athletic career by playing basketball, baseball, and [[American football|football]]. He tried out for the [[varsity team|varsity]] basketball team during his [[Tenth grade|sophomore]] year, but at 5'11" (1.80 m), he was deemed too short to play at that level. His taller friend, [[Harvest Smith|Harvest Leroy Smith]], was the only sophomore to make the team.&lt;ref name="halb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="varsity"&gt;Poppel, Seth. [http://www.newsweek.com/missing-cut-382954 "Michael Jordan Didn't Make VarsityAt First"], ''Newsweek'', October 17, 2015. Retrieved June 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's [[junior varsity]] squad, and tallied several 40-point games.&lt;ref name=halb/&gt; The following summer, he grew four inches (10&amp;nbsp;cm)&lt;ref name="varsity"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nbah"/&gt; and trained rigorously. Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, Jordan averaged about 20 points per game over his final two seasons of high school play.&lt;ref name="br"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BB"/&gt; As a [[Twelfth grade|senior]], he was selected to the [[McDonald's All-American Team]]&lt;ref name="McDonald's"/&gt; after averaging a [[triple-double]]: 29.2 points, 11.6 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]], and 10.1 [[assist (basketball)|assists]].&lt;ref name="triple-double"/&gt;

Jordan was recruited by numerous college basketball programs, including [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]], [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]], [[South Carolina Gamecocks men's basketball|South Carolina]], [[Syracuse Orange men's basketball|Syracuse]], and [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam, pgs. 6768.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, Jordan accepted a basketball scholarship to North Carolina, where he [[College major|majored]] in [[cultural geography]].&lt;ref&gt;LeFeber, pg. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==College career==
[[File:Michael Jordan UNC Jersey cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jordan's number 23 jersey among others in the rafters of The [[Dean Smith Center]]]]
As a freshman in coach [[Dean Smith]]'s team-oriented system, he was named [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] Freshman of the Year after he averaged 13.4 [[points per game]] (ppg) on 53.4% shooting ([[field goal percentage]]).&lt;ref name="dbb"/&gt; He made the game-winning jump shot in the [[1982 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament#Championship game|1982 NCAA Championship]] game against [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]], which was led by future NBA rival [[Patrick Ewing]].&lt;ref name="nbah"/&gt; Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career.&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in Lazenby, Roland. "Michaelangelo: Portrait of a Champion". ''Michael Jordan: The Ultimate Career Tribute''. Bannockburn, Illinois: H&amp;S Media, 1999. pg. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; During his three seasons at North Carolina, he averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting, and added 5.0 [[rebounds per game]] (rpg).&lt;ref name="br" /&gt;  He was selected by consensus to the [[1983 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|NCAA All-American First Team]] in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons. After winning the [[Naismith College Player of the Year|Naismith]] and the [[John R. Wooden Award|Wooden]] College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina one year before his scheduled graduation to enter the [[1984 NBA draft]]. The [[198485 Chicago Bulls season|Chicago Bulls]] selected Jordan with the third overall pick, after [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] ([[198485 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]]) and [[Sam Bowie]] ([[198485 Portland Trail Blazers season|Portland Trail Blazers]]). One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a [[center (basketball)|center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trail Blazers don't regret bypassing Jordan|date=November 26, 1984|first=David|last=DuPree|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|page=6C}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Trail Blazers general manager [[Stu Inman]] contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center, but more a matter of taking Sam Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had [[Clyde Drexler]], who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Portland GM is happy with Bowie|date=November 25, 1984|first=Bob|last=Sakamoto|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|page=B2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ESPN]], citing Bowie's injury-laden college career, named the Blazers' choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenfield, David.

Jordan is one of the most marketed sports figures in history. He has been a major spokesman for such brands as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Chevrolet]], [[Gatorade]], [[McDonald's]], [[Ball Park Franks]], [[Rayovac]], [[Wheaties]], [[Hanes]], and [[MCI Communications|MCI]].&lt;ref name="rov"&gt;Rovell, Darren.

Retrieved January 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan has had a long relationship with Gatorade, appearing in over 20 commercials for the company since 1991, including the "[[Be Like Mike]]" commercials in which a song was sung by children wishing to be like Jordan.&lt;ref name="rov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vancil, Mark. [http://www.nba.com/jordan/hoop_phenomenon.html "Michael Jordan: Phenomenon"], ''Hoop Magazine'', December 1991. Retrieved March 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nike created a signature shoe for him, called the ''[[Air Jordan]]''. One of Jordan's more popular commercials for the shoe involved [[Spike Lee]] playing the part of [[Mars Blackmon]]. In the commercials Lee, as Blackmon, attempted to find the source of Jordan's abilities and became convinced that "it's gotta be the shoes".&lt;ref name="rov"/&gt; The hype and demand for the shoes even brought on a spate of "shoe-jackings" where people were robbed of their sneakers at gunpoint. Subsequently, Nike spun off the Jordan line into its own division named the "Jordan Brand". The company features an impressive list of athletes and celebrities as endorsers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/53/UGGU.html "Michael Jordan"], ''Forbes''.
