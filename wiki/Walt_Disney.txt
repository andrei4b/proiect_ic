'''Walter Elias Disney''' ({{IPAc-en||d||z|n|i}};&lt;ref name="OD: pronunciation" /&gt; December 5, 1901{{snds}}December 15, 1966) was an American entrepreneur, animator, voice actor and film producer. A pioneer of the [[Modern animation in the United States|American animation industry]], he introduced several developments in the production of [[cartoon]]s. As a film producer, Disney holds the record for most [[Academy Awards]] earned by an individual, having won 22 Oscars from 59 nominations. He was presented with two [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] Special Achievement Awards and an [[Emmy Award]], among other honors. Several of his films are included in the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].

Born in Chicago in 1901, Disney developed an early interest in drawing. He took art classes as a boy and got a job as a commercial illustrator at the age of 18. He moved to [[California]] in the early 1920s and set up the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney Brothers Studio]] with his brother [[Roy O. Disney|Roy]]. With [[Ub Iwerks]], Walt developed the character [[Mickey Mouse]] in 1928, his first highly popular success; he also provided the voice for his creation in the early years. As the studio grew, Disney became more adventurous, introducing synchronized sound, full-color three-strip [[Technicolor]], feature-length cartoons and technical developments in cameras. The results, seen in features such as ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937), ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (both 1940), ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941) and ''[[Bambi]]'' (1942), furthered the development of animated film. New animated and live-action films followed after World War II, including the critically successful ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950) and ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964), the latter of which received five Academy Awards.

In the 1950s, Disney expanded into the [[amusement park]] industry, and in 1955 he opened [[Disneyland]]. To fund the project he diversified into television programs, such as ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|Walt Disney's Disneyland]]'' and ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''; he was also involved in planning the [[American National Exhibition|1959 Moscow Fair]], the [[1960 Winter Olympics]], and the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]. In 1965, he began development of another theme park, [[Walt Disney World|Disney World]], the heart of which was to be a new type of city, the "[[EPCOT (concept)|Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow]]" (EPCOT). Disney was a heavy smoker throughout his life, and died of lung cancer in December 1966 before either the park or the EPCOT project were completed.

Disney was a shy, self-deprecating and insecure man in private but adopted a warm and outgoing public persona. He had high standards and high expectations of those with whom he worked. Although there have been accusations that he was [[Racism|racist]] or [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]], they have been contradicted by many who knew him. His reputation changed in the years after his death, from a purveyor of homely patriotic values to a representative of [[American imperialism]]. He nevertheless remains an important figure in the history of animation and in the cultural history of the United States, where he is considered a national [[cultural icon]]. His film work continues to be shown and adapted; his studio maintains high standards in its production of popular entertainment, and the Disney amusement parks have grown in size and number to attract visitors in several countries.

==Biography==
===Early life: 19011920===
Walt Disney was born on December 5, 1901, at 1249 Tripp Avenue, in Chicago's [[Hermosa, Chicago|Hermosa]] neighborhood.{{efn|In 1909, in a renumbering exercise, the property's address changed to 2156 North Tripp Avenue.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=8}}}} He was the fourth son of [[Elias Disney]]{{nsmdns}}born in the [[Province of Canada]], to Irish parents{{nsmdns}}and [[Flora Call Disney|Flora]] ({{nee}} Call), an American of German and English descent.&lt;ref name="ST: background" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EB: Crowther" /&gt;{{efn|Disney was a descendant of Robert d'Isigny, a Frenchman who had traveled to England with [[William the Conqueror]] in 1066.{{sfnm|1a1=Mosley|1y=1990|1p=22|2a1=Eliot|2y=1995|2p=2}} The family [[anglicisation|anglicized]] the d'Isigny name to "Disney" and settled in the English village now known as [[Norton Disney]] in the [[East Midlands]].&lt;ref name=Ancestors /&gt;}} Aside from Disney, Elias and Call's sons were Herbert, Raymond and [[Roy O. Disney|Roy]]; the couple had a fifth child, Ruth, in December 1903.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|pp=910}} In 1906, when Disney was four, the family moved to a farm in [[Marceline, Missouri]], where his uncle Robert had just purchased land. In Marceline, Disney developed his interest in drawing when he was paid to draw the horse of a retired neighborhood doctor.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=910, 15}} Elias was a subscriber to the ''[[Appeal to Reason (newspaper)|Appeal to Reason]]'' newspaper, and Disney practiced drawing by copying the front-page cartoons of [[Ryan Walker (cartoonist)|Ryan Walker]].{{sfn|Barrier|2007|p=13}} Disney also began to develop an ability to work with watercolors and crayons.&lt;ref name="EB: Crowther" /&gt; He lived near the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] line and became enamored with trains.{{sfn|Broggie|2006|pp=3335}} He and his younger sister Ruth started school at the same time at the Park School in Marceline in late 1909.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|p=16}}

In 1911, the Disneys moved to [[Kansas City, Missouri]].{{sfn|Finch|1999|p=10}} There, Disney attended the Benton Grammar School, where he met fellow-student Walter Pfeiffer, who came from a family of theatre fans and introduced Disney to the world of [[vaudeville]] and motion pictures. Before long, he was spending more time at the Pfeiffers' house than at home.{{sfn|Krasniewicz|2010|p=13}} Elias had purchased a newspaper delivery route for ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' and ''[[Kansas City Times]]''. Disney and his brother Roy woke up at 4:30 every morning to deliver the ''Times'' before school and repeated the round for the evening ''Star'' after school. The schedule was exhausting, and Disney often received poor grades after falling asleep in class, but he continued his paper route for more than six years.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|pp=1819}} He attended Saturday courses at the [[Kansas City Art Institute]] and also took a [[correspondence course]] in cartooning.&lt;ref name="EB: Crowther" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KCL: WD" /&gt;

In 1917, Elias bought stock in a Chicago jelly producer, the O-Zell Company, and moved back to the city with his family.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=30}} Disney enrolled at [[McKinley High School (Chicago)|McKinley High School]] and became the cartoonist of the school newspaper, drawing patriotic pictures about World War I;&lt;ref name="D23: WD" /&gt;{{sfn|Finch|1999|p=12}} he also took night courses at the [[Chicago Academy of Fine Arts]].{{sfn|Mosley|1990|p=39}} In mid-1918, Disney attempted to join the [[United States Army]] to fight [[Western Front (World War I)|against the Germans]], but he was rejected for being too young. After [[age fabrication|forging the date of birth]] on his birth certificate, he joined the [[Red Cross]] in September 1918 as an ambulance driver. He was shipped to France but arrived in November, after [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|the armistice]].{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=3638}} He drew cartoons on the side of his ambulance for decoration and had some of his work published in the army newspaper ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]''.&lt;ref name="NYT: Obit" /&gt; Disney returned to Kansas City in October 1919,{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=41}} where he worked as an apprentice artist at the Pesmen-Rubin Commercial Art Studio. There, he drew commercial illustrations for advertising, theater programs and catalogs. He also befriended fellow artist [[Ub Iwerks]].{{sfn|Thomas|1994|pp=5556}}

===Early career: 19201928===
[[File:Walt Disney envelope ca. 1921.jpg|thumb|left|Walt Disney's business envelope featured a self-portrait {{circa|1921}}]]
In January 1920, as Pesmen-Rubin's revenue declined after Christmas, Disney and Iwerks were laid off. They started their own business, the short-lived Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists.{{sfnm|1a1=Thomas|1y=1994|1p=56|2a1=Barrier|2y=2007|2pp=2425}} Failing to attract many customers, Disney and Iwerks agreed that Disney should leave temporarily to earn money at the Kansas City Film Ad Company, run by A.&amp;nbsp;V. Cauger; the following month Iwerks, who was not able to run their business alone, also joined.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|p=25}} The company produced commercials using the [[cutout animation]] technique.{{sfn|Mosley|1990|p=63}} Disney became interested in animation, although he preferred drawn cartoons such as ''[[Mutt and Jeff]]'' and ''[[Koko the Clown]]''. With the assistance of a borrowed book on animation and a camera, he began experimenting at home.{{sfn|Thomas|1994|pp=5758}}{{efn|The book, Edwin G. Lutz's ''Animated Cartoons: How They Are Made, Their Origin and Development'' (1920), was the only one in the local library on the subject; the camera he borrowed from Cauger.{{sfn|Thomas|1994|pp=5758}}}} He came to the conclusion that [[cel animation]] was more promising than the cutout method.{{efn|Cutout animation is the technique of producing cartoons by animating objects cut from paper, material or photographs and photographing them moving incrementally. Cel animation is the method of drawing or painting onto transparent celluloid sheets ("cels"), with each sheet an incremental movement on from the previous.{{sfn|Withrow|2009|p=48}}}} Unable to persuade Cauger to try [[cel]] animation at the company, Disney opened a new business with a co-worker from the Film Ad Co, [[Fred Harman]].{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=56}} Their main client was the local Newman Theater, and the short cartoons they produced were sold as "Newman's Laugh-O-Grams".{{sfn|Finch|1999|p=14}} Disney studied [[Paul Terry (cartoonist)|Paul Terry's]] ''[[Aesop's Fables (film series)|Aesop's Fables]]'' as a model, and the first six "Laugh-O-Grams" were modernized fairy tales.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|p=60}}

[[File:Newman Laugh-O-Gram (1921).webm|thumb|thumbtime=2|''Newman Laugh-O-Gram'' (1921)]]
In May 1921, the success of the "Laugh-O-Grams" led to the establishment of [[Laugh-O-Gram Studio]], for which he hired more animators, including Fred Harman's brother [[Harman and Ising|Hugh]], [[Harman and Ising|Rudolf Ising]] and Iwerks.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=6061, 6466}} The Laugh-O-Grams cartoons did not provide enough income to keep the company solvent, so Disney started production of ''[[Alice Comedies#Alice's Wonderland|Alice's Wonderland]]''{{nsmdns}}based on ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''{{nsmdns}}which combined live action with animation; he cast [[Virginia Davis]] in [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|the title role]].{{sfn|Finch|1999|p=15}} The result, a 12-and-a-half-minute, [[short film|one-reel]] film, was completed too late to save Laugh-O-Gram Studio, which went into bankruptcy in 1923.{{sfnm|1a1=Gabler|1y=2006|1pp=7173|2a1=Nichols|2y=2014|2p=102}}

Disney moved to Hollywood in July 1923. Although New York was the center of the cartoon industry, he was attracted to Los Angeles because his brother Roy was convalescing from [[tuberculosis]] there.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=39}} Disney's efforts to sell ''Alice's Wonderland'' were in vain until he heard from New York film distributor [[Margaret J. Winkler]]. She was losing the rights to both the ''[[Out of the Inkwell]]'' and ''[[Felix the Cat]]'' cartoons, and needed a new series. In October they signed a contract for six [[Alice Comedies|''Alice'' comedies]], with an option for two further series of six episodes each.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|p=40}} Disney and his brother Roy formed the Disney Brothers Studio{{nsmdns}}which later became [[The Walt Disney Company]]{{nsmdns}}to produce the films;{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=78}}&lt;ref name="WDC: About" /&gt; they persuaded Davis and her family to relocate to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] to continue production, with Davis on contract at $100 a month. In July 1924 Disney also hired Iwerks, persuading him to relocate to Hollywood from Kansas City.{{sfn|Thomas|1994|pp=7375}}

Early in 1925, Disney hired an ink artist, [[Lillian Disney|Lillian Bounds]]. They married in July of that year, at her brother's house in her hometown of [[Lewiston, Idaho]].&lt;ref name=wddiofclmt&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=D7peAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fC8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4762%2C3438544 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho) |agency=Associated Press |title=Walt Disney dies of cancer at 65 |date=December 16, 1966 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was generally happy, according to Lillian, although according to Disney's biographer [[Neal Gabler]] she did not "accept Walt's decisions meekly or his status unquestionably, and she admitted that he was always telling people 'how henpecked he is'."{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=544}}{{efn|One possible exception to the stable relationship was during the making ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937), where the stresses and turmoil associated with the production led to the couple discussing divorce.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=544}}}} Lillian had little interest in films or the Hollywood social scene and she was, in the words of the historian Steven Watts, "content with household management and providing support for her husband".{{sfn|Watts|2013|p=352}} Their marriage produced two daughters, [[Diane Disney Miller|Diane]] (born December 1933) and Sharon (adopted in December 1936, born six weeks previously).{{sfn|Barrier|2007|pp=102, 131}}{{efn|Lillian had two miscarriages during the eight years between marriage and the birth of Diane; she suffered a further miscarriage shortly before the family adopted Sharon.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|pp=102, 131}}}} Within [[Disney family|the family]], neither Disney nor his wife hid the fact Sharon had been adopted, although they became annoyed if people outside the family raised the point.{{sfnm|1a1=Mosley|1y=1990|1p=169|2a1=Gabler|2y=2006|2p=280}} The Disneys were careful to keep their daughters out of the public eye as much as possible, particularly in the light of the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]]; Disney took steps to ensure his daughters were not photographed by the press.{{sfnm|1a1=Thomas|1y=1994|1p=196|2a1=Watts|2y=2013|2p=352}}

[[File:Trolley Troubles poster.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A cartoon rabbit is driving a tramcar; other cartoon rabbits are in, under, on and around the car.|Theatrical poster for ''[[Trolley Troubles]]'' (1927)]]
By 1926 Winkler's role in the distribution of the ''Alice'' series had been handed over to her husband, the film producer [[Charles Mintz]], although the relationship between him and Disney was sometimes strained.&lt;ref name="WDFM: Alice Skids" /&gt; The series ran until July 1927,&lt;ref name="WDFM: Final Alice" /&gt; by which time Disney had begun to tire of it and wanted to move away from the mixed format to all animation.&lt;ref name="WDFM: Alice Skids" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC: Oswald" /&gt; After Mintz requested new material to distribute through [[Universal Pictures]], Disney and Iwerks created [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]], a character Disney wanted to be "peppy, alert, saucy and venturesome, keeping him also neat and trim".&lt;ref name="BBC: Oswald" /&gt;{{sfn|Thomas|1994|p=83}}

In February 1928, Disney hoped to negotiate a larger fee for producing the ''Oswald'' series, but found Mintz wanting to reduce the payments. Mintz had also persuaded many of the artists involved to work directly for him, including Harman, Ising, [[Carman Maxwell]] and [[Friz Freleng]]. Disney also found out that Universal owned the [[intellectual property rights]] to Oswald. Mintz threatened to start his own studio and produce the series himself if Disney refused to accept the reductions. Disney declined Mintz's ultimatum and lost most of his animation staff, except Iwerks, who chose to remain with him.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=109}}&lt;ref name="WDFM: Secret Talks" /&gt;{{efn|In 2006, [[the Walt Disney Company]] finally re-acquired Oswald the Lucky Rabbit when its subsidiary [[ESPN]] purchased rights to the character, along with other properties from [[NBCUniversal]].&lt;ref name="EPSN: Oswald" /&gt;}}

===Creation of Mickey Mouse to the first Academy Awards: 19281933===
To replace Oswald, Disney and Iwerks developed [[Mickey Mouse]], possibly inspired by a pet mouse that Disney had adopted while working in his Laugh-O-Gram studio, although the origins of the character are unclear.{{sfn|Thomas|1994|p=88}}{{efn|Several stories about the origins exist. Disney's biographer, [[Bob Thomas (reporter)|Bob Thomas]], observes that "The birth of Mickey Mouse is obscured in legend, much of it created by Walt Disney himself."{{sfn|Thomas|1994|p=88}}}} Disney's original choice of name was Mortimer Mouse, but Lillian thought it too pompous, and suggested Mickey instead.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=112}}{{efn|The name Mortimer Mouse was used in the 1936 cartoon ''[[Mickey's Rival]]'' as a potential love-interest for [[Minnie Mouse]]. He was portrayed as a "humorous denigration of the smooth [[city slicker]]" with a smart car, but failed to win over Minnie from the more homespun Mickey.{{sfn|Watts|2013|p=73}}}} Iwerks revised Disney's provisional sketches to make the character easier to animate, and Disney provided Mickey's voice until 1947. In the words of one Disney employee, "Ub designed Mickey's physical appearance, but Walt gave him his soul."&lt;ref name="WDFM: MM" /&gt;

[[File:Steamboat-willie.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A cartoon mouse is operating a ship's steering wheel|The first appearance of [[Mickey Mouse]], in ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' (1928)]]
Mickey Mouse first appeared in May 1928 as a single test screening of the short ''[[Plane Crazy]]'', but it, and the second feature, ''[[The Gallopin' Gaucho]]'', failed to find a distributor.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=116}} Following the 1927 sensation ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', Disney used synchronized sound on the third short, ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'', to create the first post-produced [[sound film|sound cartoon]]. After the animation was complete, Disney signed a contract with the former executive of Universal Pictures, [[Pat Powers (businessman)|Pat Powers]], to use the "Powers Cinephone" recording system;{{sfn|Langer|2000}} Cinephone became the new distributor for Disney's early sound cartoons, which soon became popular.{{sfnm|1a1=Finch|1y=1999|1pp=2324|2a1=Gabler|2y=2006|2p=129}}

To improve the quality of the music, Disney hired the professional composer and arranger [[Carl Stalling]], on whose suggestion the ''[[Silly Symphony]]'' series was developed, providing stories through the use of music; the first in the series, ''[[The Skeleton Dance]]'' (1929), was drawn and animated entirely by Iwerks. Also hired at this time were several local artists, some of whom stayed with the company as core animators; the group later became known as the [[Disney's Nine Old Men|Nine Old Men]].{{sfnm|1a1=Finch|1y=1999|1pp=2627|2a1=Langer|2y=2000}}{{efn|The [[Disney's Nine Old Men|Nine Old Men]] consisted of [[Eric Larson]], [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], [[Les Clark]], [[Milt Kahl]], [[Ward Kimball]], [[Marc Davis (animator)|Marc Davis]], [[Ollie Johnston]], [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]] and [[John Lounsbery]].{{sfn|Langer|2000}}}} Both the Mickey Mouse and ''Silly Symphonies'' series were successful, but Disney and his brother felt they were not receiving their rightful share of profits from Powers. In 1930, Disney tried to trim costs from the process by urging Iwerks to abandon the practice of animating every separate cel in favor of the more efficient technique of drawing key poses and letting lower-paid assistants [[Inbetweening|sketch the in-between poses]]. Disney asked Powers for an increase in payments for the cartoons. Powers refused and signed Iwerks to work for him; Stalling resigned shortly afterwards, thinking that without Iwerks, the Disney Studio would close.{{sfnm|1a1=Finch|1y=1999|1pp=2627|2a1=Gabler|2y=2006|2pp=14244}} Disney had a nervous breakdown in October 1931{{nsmdns}}which he blamed on the machinations of Powers and his own overwork{{nsmdns}}so he and Lillian took an extended holiday to Cuba and a cruise to Panama to recover.{{sfn|Krasniewicz|2010|pp=5960}}

By 1934, Disney had become dissatisfied with producing formulaic cartoon shorts,{{sfn|Thomas|1994|p=129}} and began a four-year production of a feature-length cartoon, ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', based on [[Snow White|the fairy tale]]. When news leaked out about the project, many in the film industry predicted it would bankrupt the company; industry insiders nicknamed it "Disney's Folly".{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=270}} The film, which was the first animated feature made in full color and sound, cost $1.5&amp;nbsp;million to produce{{nsmdns}}three times over budget.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrier|1y=1999|1p=130|2a1=Finch|2y=1999|2p=59}} To ensure the animation was as realistic as possible, Disney sent his animators on courses at the [[Chouinard Art Institute]];&lt;ref name="Disney Myth" /&gt; he brought animals into the studio and hired actors so that the animators could study realistic movement.&lt;ref name="Disney Experience" /&gt; To portray the changing perspective of the background as a camera moved through a scene, Disney's animators developed a [[multiplane camera]] which allowed drawings on pieces of glass to be set at various distances from the camera, creating an illusion of depth. The glass could be moved to create the impression of a camera passing through the scene. The first work created on the camera{{nsmdns}}a ''Silly Symphony'' called ''[[The Old Mill]]'' (1937){{nsmdns}}won the Academy Award for Animated Short Film because of its impressive visual power. Although ''Snow White'' had been largely finished by the time the multiplane camera had been completed, Disney ordered some scenes be re-drawn to use the new effects.{{sfn|Williams|Denney|Denney|2004|p=116}}

''Snow White'' premiered in December 1937 to high praise from critics and audiences. The film became the most successful motion picture of 1938 and by May 1939 its total gross of $6.5&amp;nbsp;million made it the most successful sound film made to that date.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=270}}{{efn|$1.5&amp;nbsp;million in 1937 equates to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1500000|1937}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}; $6.5&amp;nbsp;million in 1939 equates to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|6500000|1936}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}, according to calculations based on the [[United States Consumer Price Index|Consumer Price Index]] measure of inflation.{{inflation-fn|US}}}} Disney won another Honorary Academy Award, which consisted of one full-sized and seven miniature Oscar statuettes.&lt;ref name="AA: 1939" /&gt;{{efn|The citation for the award reads: "To Walt Disney for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, recognized as a significant screen innovation which has charmed millions and pioneered a great new entertainment field for the motion picture cartoon."&lt;ref name="AA: 1939" /&gt;}} The success of ''Snow White'' heralded one of the most productive eras for the studio; [[the Walt Disney Family Museum]] calls the following years "the 'Golden Age of Animation'{{nnbsp}}".&lt;ref name="WDFM: Golden Age" /&gt;{{sfn|Krasniewicz|2010|p=87}} With work on ''Snow White'' finished, the studio began producing ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' in early 1938 and ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' in November of the same year. Both films were released in 1940, and neither performed well at the box office{{nsmdns}}partly because revenues from Europe had dropped following the start of [[World War II]] in 1939.

In response to the financial crisis, Disney and his brother Roy started the company's [[Initial public offering|first public stock offering]] in 1940, and implemented heavy salary cuts. The latter measure, and Disney's sometimes high-handed and insensitive manner of dealing with staff, led to [[Disney animators' strike|a 1941 animators' strike]] which lasted five weeks.{{sfnm|1a1=Ceplair|1a2=Englund|1y=1983|1p=158|2a1=Thomas|2y=1994|2pp=16365|3a1=Barrier|3y=1999|3pp=17173}} While a federal mediator from the [[National Labor Relations Board]] negotiated with the two sides, Disney accepted an offer from the [[Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs]] to make a goodwill trip to South America, ensuring he was absent during a resolution he knew would be unfavorable to the studio.{{sfnm|1a1=Thomas|1y=1994|1pp=17071|2a1=Gabler|2y=2006|2pp=37071}}{{efn|The trip inspired two combined live-action and animation works ''[[Saludos Amigos]]'' (1942) and ''[[The Three Caballeros]]'' (1945).{{sfn|Finch|1999|p=76}}{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=39495}}}} As a result of the strike{{nsmdns}}and the financial state of the company{{nsmdns}}several animators left the studio, and Disney's relationship with other members of staff was permanently strained as a result.{{sfnm|1a1=Langer|1y=2000|2a1=Gabler|2y=2006|2p=378}} The strike temporarily interrupted the studio's next production, ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941), which Disney produced in a simple and inexpensive manner; the film received a positive reaction from audiences and critics alike.{{sfnm|1a1=Finch|1y=1999|1p=71|2a1=Gabler|2y=2006|2pp=38081}}

Shortly after the release of ''Dumbo'' in October 1941, the U.S. entered World War&amp;nbsp;II. Disney formed the Walt Disney Training Films Unit within the company to produce instruction films for the military such as ''Four Methods of Flush Riveting'' and ''Aircraft Production Methods''.{{sfnm|1a1=Thomas|1y=1994|1pp=18485|2a1=Gabler|2y=2006|2pp=38283}} Disney also met with [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]], the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]], and agreed to produce short [[Donald Duck]] cartoons to promote [[Series E bond|war bonds]].{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=38485}} Disney also produced several [[Walt Disney's World War II propaganda production|propaganda productions]], including shorts such as ''[[Der Fuehrer's Face]]''{{nsmdns}}which won an Academy Award{{nsmdns}}and the 1943 feature film ''[[Victory Through Air Power (film)|Victory Through Air Power]]''.{{sfn|Finch|1999|p=77}}

The military films generated only enough revenue to cover costs, and the feature film ''[[Bambi]]''{{nsmdns}}which had been in production since 1937{{nsmdns}}underperformed on its release in April 1942, and lost $200,000 at the box office.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=399}} On top of the low earnings from ''Pinocchio'' and ''Fantasia'', the company had debts of $4&amp;nbsp;million with the [[Bank of America]] in 1944.&lt;ref name="WDFM: Fiscal Crisis" /&gt;{{efn|$4&amp;nbsp;million in 1944 equates to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4000000|1944}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}, according to calculations based on the [[United States Consumer Price Index|Consumer Price Index]] measure of inflation.{{inflation-fn|US}}}} At a meeting with Bank of America executives to discuss the future of the company, the bank's chairman and founder, [[Amadeo Giannini]], told his executives, "I've been watching the Disneys' pictures quite closely because I knew we were lending them money far above the financial risk.&amp;nbsp;... They're good this year, they're good next year, and they're good the year after.&amp;nbsp;... You have to relax and give them time to market their product."{{sfn|Thomas|1994|pp=18687}} Disney's production of short films decreased in the late 1940s, coinciding with increasing competition in the animation market from [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros.]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Roy Disney, for financial reasons, suggested more combined animation and live-action productions.{{sfn|Langer|2000}}{{efn|These included ''[[Make Mine Music]]'' (1946), ''[[Song of the South]]'' (1946), ''[[Melody Time]]'' (1948) and ''[[So Dear to My Heart]]'' (1949).{{sfn|Langer|2000}}}} In 1948, Disney initiated a series of popular live-action nature films, titled ''[[True-Life Adventures]]'', with ''[[Seal Island (film)|Seal Island]]'' the first; the film won the Academy Award in the [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film|Best Short Subject (Two-Reel)]] category.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=44546}}

[[File:DisneySchiphol1951.jpg|thumb|Disney family at Schiphol Airport (1951)]]
In 1949, Disney and his family moved to a new home in the [[Holmby Hills]] district of Los Angeles. With the help of his friends [[Ward Kimball|Ward and Betty Kimball]], who already had their own [[Grizzly Flats Railroad|backyard railroad]], Disney developed blueprints and immediately set to work on creating a miniature [[live steam]] railroad for his backyard.

In early 1950, Disney produced ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', his studio's first animated feature in eight years. It was popular with critics and theater audiences.

From the early to mid-1950s, Disney began to devote less attention to the animation department, entrusting most of its operations to his key animators, the Nine Old Men, although he was always present at story meetings. Instead, he started concentrating on other ventures.{{sfn|Canemaker|2001|p=110}}

[[File:WaltDisneyplansDisneylandDec1954.jpg|thumb|left|Disney shows the plans of [[Disneyland]] to officials from [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] in December 1954]]
For several years Disney had been considering building a theme park. When he visited [[Griffith Park]] in Los Angeles with his daughters, he wanted to be in a clean, unspoiled park, where both children and their parents could have fun.&lt;ref name="WDFM: Dreaming" /&gt; He visited the [[Tivoli Gardens]] in Copenhagen, Denmark, and was heavily influenced by the cleanliness and layout of the park.&lt;ref name="Disney Myth 2" /&gt; In March 1952 he received zoning permission to build a theme park in Burbank, near the Disney studios.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|pp=23334}} This site proved too small, and a larger plot in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], {{convert|35|mi|km}} south of the studio, was purchased. To distance the project from the studio{{nsmdns}}which might attract the criticism of shareholders{{nsmdns}}Disney formed WED Enterprises (now [[Walt Disney Imagineering]]) and used his own money to fund a group of designers and animators to work on the plans;&lt;ref name="WDFM: WED" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WDFM: Genesis" /&gt; those involved became known as "Imagineers".{{sfn|Finch|1999|p=139}} After obtaining bank funding he invited other stockholders, [[American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres]]{{nsmdns}}part of [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC){{nsmdns}}and [[Western Publishing|Western Printing and Lithographing Company]].{{sfn|Langer|2000}} In mid-1954, Disney sent his Imagineers to every amusement park in the U.S. to analyze what worked and what pitfalls or problems there were in the various locations and incorporated their findings into his design.{{sfn|Barrier|2007|p=246}} Construction work started in July 1954, and [[Disneyland]] opened in July 1955; the opening ceremony was broadcast on ABC, which reached 70&amp;nbsp;million viewers.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=524, 53032}} The park was designed as a series of themed lands, linked by the central [[Main Street, U.S.A.]]{{nsmdns}}a replica of the main street in his hometown of Marceline. The connected themed areas were [[Adventureland (Disney)|Adventureland]], [[Frontierland]], [[Fantasyland]] and [[Tomorrowland]]. The park also contained the [[Narrow-gauge railway|narrow gauge]] [[Disneyland Railroad]] that linked the lands; around the outside of the park was a high [[berm]] to separate the park from the outside world.{{sfn|Eliot|1995|pp=22526}}{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=498}} An editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'' considered that Disney had "tastefully combined some of the pleasant things of yesterday with fantasy and dreams of tomorrow".&lt;ref name="NYT: Topics" /&gt; Although there were early minor problems with the park, it was a success, and after a month's operation, Disneyland was receiving over 20,000 visitors a day; by the end of its first year, it attracted 3.6&amp;nbsp;million guests.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=537}}

The money from ABC was contingent on Disney television programs.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=50809}} The studio had been involved in a successful television special on Christmas Day 1950 about the making of ''Alice in Wonderland''. Roy believed the program added millions to the box office takings.

It will probably be on this premise that we enter television when we do".{{sfn|Langer|2000}} In 1954, after the Disneyland funding had been agreed, ABC broadcast ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|Walt Disney's Disneyland]]'', an anthology consisting of animated cartoons, live-action features and other material from the studio's library.

Disney provided four exhibits for the [[1964 New York World's Fair]], for which he obtained funding from selected corporate sponsors. For [[PepsiCo]], who planned a tribute to [[UNICEF]], Disney developed [[It's a Small World]], a boat ride with audio-animatronic dolls depicting children of the world; [[Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln]] contained an animatronic [[Abraham Lincoln]] giving excerpts from his speeches; [[Walt Disney's Carousel of Progress|Carousel of Progress]] promoted the importance of electricity; and Ford's Magic Skyway portrayed the progress of mankind.

During the early to mid-1960s, Disney developed plans for a [[ski resort]] in [[Mineral King]], a glacial valley in California's [[Sierra Nevada (US)|Sierra Nevada]].

Disney World was to include the "Magic Kingdom"{{nsmdns}}a larger and more elaborate version of Disneyland{{nsmdns}}plus golf courses and resort hotels. The heart of Disney World was to be the "Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow" ([[EPCOT (concept)|EPCOT]]),{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=60608}} which he described as:

His estate included a 14 percent holding in Walt Disney Productions worth $20&amp;nbsp;million.{{efn|Disney held 26,000 shares, Lillian owned 28,000 and they jointly owned 250,000, which amounted to 14 percent.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=62930}}}}{{efn|$20&amp;nbsp;million in 1966 equates to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|20000000|1966}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}, according to calculations based on the [[United States Consumer Price Index|Consumer Price Index]] measure of inflation.{{inflation-fn|US}}}} He left 45 percent of his estate to his wife and children{{nsmdns}}much in a family trust{{nsmdns}}and 10 percent to his sister, nieces and nephews.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=62930}} The remaining 45 percent went into a charitable trust, 95 percent of which was designated for CalArts, to build a new campus (a figure of around $15&amp;nbsp;million); he also donated {{convert|38|acre|km2|3|abbr=on}} of the Golden Oaks ranch in [[Valencia, Santa Clarita, California|Valencia]] for construction of that school. The university moved there in November 1971.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrier|1y=2007|1p=320|2a1=Mannheim|2y=2016|2p=73}}

The release of ''The Jungle Book'' and ''The Happiest Millionaire'' in 1967 raised the total number of feature films that Disney had been involved in to 81.&lt;ref name="D23: WD" /&gt; When ''Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day'' was released in 1968, it earned Disney an Academy Award in the Short Subject (Cartoon) category, awarded posthumously.{{sfn|Dobson|2009|p=220}} After Disney's death, his studios continued to produce live-action films prolifically but largely abandoned animation until the late 1980s, after which there was what ''[[The New York Times]]'' describes as the "[[Disney Renaissance]]" that began with ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989).&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt; Disney's companies continue to produce successful film, television and stage entertainment.&lt;ref name="WDS: History" /&gt;

Disney's plans for the futuristic city of EPCOT did not come to fruition. After Disney's death, his brother Roy deferred his retirement to take full control of the Disney companies. He changed the focus of the project from a town to an attraction.&lt;ref name="Esquire: EPCOT" /&gt; At the inauguration in 1971, Roy dedicated Walt Disney World to his brother.&lt;ref name="DWR: WH" /&gt;{{efn|Roy died two months later, in December 1971.{{sfn|Thomas|1994|pp=35758}}}} Walt Disney World expanded with the opening of [[Epcot Center]] in 1982; Walt Disney's vision of a functional city was replaced by a park more akin to a permanent [[world's fair]].&lt;ref name="ATT: EPCOT" /&gt; In 2009, the Walt Disney Family Museum, designed by Disney's daughter Diane and her son Walter E. D. Miller, opened in the [[Presidio of San Francisco]].&lt;ref name="WDFM: About" /&gt; Thousands of artifacts from Disney's life and career are on display, including numerous awards that he received.&lt;ref name="NYT: WDFM" /&gt; In 2014, the Disney theme parks around the world hosted approximately 134 million visitors.&lt;ref name="NYDNOctober2015"/&gt;

Disney has been portrayed numerous times in fictional works. [[H. G. Wells]] references Disney in his 1938 novel ''[[The Holy Terror (Wells novel)|The Holy Terror]]'', in which World Dictator Rud fears that Donald Duck is meant to lampoon the dictator.{{sfn|Pierce|1987|p=100}} Disney was portrayed by [[Len Cariou]] in the 1995 made-for-TV film ''A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes: The Annette Funicello Story'',&lt;ref name="Variety: Dream Is a Wish" /&gt; and by [[Tom Hanks]] in the 2013 film ''[[Saving Mr. Banks]]''.&lt;ref name="Saving Mr Banks" /&gt; In 2001, the German author [[Peter Stephan Jungk]] published {{lang|de|Der Knig von Amerika}} (trans: ''The King of America''), a fictional work of Disney's later years that re-imagines him as a power-hungry racist. The composer [[Philip Glass]] later adapted the book into the opera ''[[The Perfect American]]'' (2013).&lt;ref name="DT: Perfect Am" /&gt;

Disney received 59 Academy Award nominations, including 22 awards: both totals are records.&lt;ref name="Nominee Facts" /&gt; He was nominated for three [[Golden Globe Award]]s, but did not win, but he was presented with two Special Achievement Awards{{nsmdns}}for ''Bambi'' (1942) and ''[[The Living Desert]]'' (1953){{nsmdns}}and the [[Golden Globe Cecil B.

In February 1960, Disney was inducted to the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] with two stars, one for motion pictures and the other for his television work;&lt;ref name="Hollywood WoF" /&gt; Mickey Mouse was given his own star for motion pictures in 1978.&lt;ref name="Hollywood WoF: MM" /&gt; Disney was also inducted into the [[Television Hall of Fame]] in 1986,&lt;ref name="Emmy: HoF" /&gt; the [[California Hall of Fame]] in December 2006,&lt;ref name="CHoF: WD" /&gt; and was the inaugural recipient of a star on the [[Anaheim/Orange County Walk of Stars|Anaheim walk of stars]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="OC Walk of Stars" /&gt;

The Walt Disney Family Museum records that he "along with members of his staff, received more than 950 honors and citations from throughout the world".&lt;ref name="D23: WD" /&gt; He was made a {{lang|fr|Chevalier}} in the French {{lang|fr|[[Legion of Honour|Lgion d'honneur]]}} in 1935,&lt;ref name="Guard: Legion" /&gt; and in 1952 he was awarded the country's highest artistic decoration, the {{lang|fr|Officer d'Academie}}.&lt;ref name="SMT: Academie" /&gt; Other national awards include Thailand's Order of the Crown; Brazil's Order of the Southern Cross and Mexico's Order of the Aztec Eagle.&lt;ref name=CalMuseum /&gt; In the United States, he received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] on September 14, 1964&lt;ref name="WP: Freedom" /&gt; and, in 1969, he was posthumously awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]].&lt;ref name="VNN: CGM" /&gt; He received the Showman of the World Award from the National Association of Theatre Owners,&lt;ref name=CalMuseum /&gt; and, in 1955, the [[National Audubon Society]] awarded Disney its highest honor, the Audubon Medal, for promoting the "appreciation and understanding of nature" through his ''True-Life Adventures'' nature films.&lt;ref name="Audubon Medal" /&gt; A [[minor planet]] discovered in 1980 by astronomer [[Lyudmila Karachkina]], was named [[4017 Disneya]],{{sfn|Schmadel|2003|p=342}} and he was also awarded honorary degrees from [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Yale University|Yale]], the [[University of Southern California]] and the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="D23: WD" /&gt;

==Personality and reputation==
[[File:Disney1968.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A portrait of Disney with cartoon representations of different nationalities on a 6 cent US stamp|1968 U.S. postage stamp]]
Disney's public persona was very different from his actual personality.&lt;ref name="PBS trailer 2" /&gt; Playwright [[Robert E. Sherwood]] described him as "almost painfully shy&amp;nbsp;... diffident" and self-deprecating.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=204}} According to his biographer [[Richard Schickel]], Disney hid his shy and insecure personality behind his public identity.{{sfn|Schickel|1986|p=341}} Kimball argues that Disney "played the role of a bashful tycoon who was embarrassed in public" and knew that he was doing so.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=205}} Disney acknowledged the faade, and told a friend that "I'm not Walt Disney. I do a lot of things Walt Disney would not do. Walt Disney does not smoke. I smoke. Walt Disney does not drink. I drink."&lt;ref name="PBS trailer 1" /&gt; Critic [[Otis Ferguson]], in ''[[The New Republic]]'', called the private Disney: "common and everyday, not inaccessible, not in a foreign language, not suppressed or sponsored or anything. Just Disney."{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=205}} Many of those with whom Disney worked commented that he gave his staff little encouragement due to his exceptionally high expectations. Norman recalls that when Disney said "That'll work", it was an indication of high praise.{{sfn|Norman|2013|p=64}} Instead of direct approval, Disney gave high-performing staff financial bonuses, or recommended certain individuals to others, expecting that his praise would be passed on.{{sfn|Krasniewicz|2010|p=77}}

Views of Disney and his work have changed over the decades, and there have been polarized opinions.{{sfn|Watts|1995|p=84}} Mark Langer, in the ''American Dictionary of National Biography'', writes that "Earlier evaluations of Disney hailed him as a patriot, folk artist, and popularizer of culture. More recently, Disney has been regarded as a paradigm of American imperialism and intolerance, as well as a debaser of culture."{{sfn|Langer|2000}} Steven Watts wrote that some denounce Disney "as a cynical manipulator of cultural and commercial formulas",{{sfn|Watts|1995|p=84}} while [[PBS]] records that critics have censured his work because of its "smooth faade of sentimentality and stubborn optimism, its feel-good re-write of American history".&lt;ref name="PBS: AmEx" /&gt; Although Disney's films have been highly praised, very popular and commercially successful over time,{{sfn|Langer|2000}}{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=x}} there were criticisms by reviewers. [[C. A. Lejeune|Caroline Lejeune]] comments in ''[[The Observer]]'' that ''Snow White'' (1937) "has more faults than any earlier Disney cartoon. It is vulnerable again and again to the barbed criticisms of the experts. Sometimes it is, frankly, badly drawn."&lt;ref name="Obs: Snow White" /&gt; Robin Allen, writing for ''The Times'', notes that ''Fantasia'' (1940) was "condemned for its vulgarity and lurches into [[bathos]]",&lt;ref name="Times: Fantasia" /&gt; while Lejeune, reviewing ''Alice in Wonderland'' (1951), feels the film "may drive lovers of Lewis Carroll to frenzy".&lt;ref name="Obs: Alice" /&gt; ''Peter Pan'' (1953) was criticized in ''The Times'' as "a children's classic vulgarized" with "Tinker Bell&amp;nbsp;... a peroxided American cutie". The reviewer opined that Disney "has slaughtered good Barrie and has only second-rate Disney to put in its place".&lt;ref name="Times: PP" /&gt;

Disney has been accused of [[antisemitism|anti-Semitism]],&lt;ref name="NYT: Dargis" /&gt;{{efn|For example, the animator [[Art Babbitt]], an organizer of the 1941 strike at Disney's studio, claimed that he saw Disney and his lawyer attend meetings of the [[German American Bund]], a pro-Nazi organization, during the late 1930s.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=448}} Gabler questions Babbitt's claim on the basis that Disney had no time for political meetings and was "something of a political naf" during the 1930s.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=448, 457}}}} although none of his employees{{nsmdns}}including the animator [[Art Babbitt]], who disliked Disney intensely{{nsmdns}}ever accused him of making anti-Semitic slurs or taunts.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=448, 457}} The Walt Disney Family Museum acknowledges that ethnic stereotypes common to films of the 1930s were included in some early cartoons.{{efn|Examples include ''The Three Little Pigs'' (in which the Big Bad Wolf comes to the door dressed as a Jewish peddler) and ''[[The Opry House]]'' (in which Mickey Mouse is dressed and dances as a [[Hasidic Jew]]).{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=456}}&lt;ref name="Creative Explosion" /&gt;}} Disney donated regularly to Jewish charities, he was named "1955 Man of the Year" by the [[B'nai B'rith]] chapter in Beverly Hills,{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=456}}&lt;ref name="Creative Explosion" /&gt; and his studio employed a number of Jews, some of whom were in influential positions.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=455}}{{efn|As pointed out by story artist [[Joe Grant]], which included himself, production manager Harry Tytle, and head of merchandising [[Kay Kamen]], who once quipped that Disney's New York office had "more Jews than The Book of Leviticus"{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=455}}}} Gabler, the first writer to gain unrestricted access to the Disney archives, concludes that the available evidence does not support accusations of anti-Semitism and that Disney was "not [anti-Semitic] in the conventional sense that we think of someone as being an anti-Semite". Gabler concludes that "though Walt himself, in my estimation, was not anti-Semitic, nevertheless, he willingly allied himself with people who were anti-Semitic [meaning some members of the [[Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals|MPAPAI]]], and that reputation stuck. He was never really able to expunge it throughout his life".&lt;ref name="CBS: Gabler" /&gt; Disney distanced himself from the Motion Picture Alliance in the 1950s.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=611}}

Disney has also been accused of other forms of racism because some of his productions released between the 1930s and 1950s contain racially insensitive material.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=433}}{{efn|Examples include ''[[Mickey's Mellerdrammer]]'', in which Mickey Mouse dresses in [[blackface]]; the black-colored bird in the short ''Who Killed Cock Robin''; the American Indians in ''Peter Pan''; and the crows in ''Dumbo'' (although the case has been made that the crows were sympathetic to Dumbo because they knew what it was like to be ostracized).{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=433}}}} The feature film ''[[Song of the South]]'' was criticized by contemporary film critics, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], and others for its perpetuation of [[Stereotypes of African Americans|black stereotypes]],{{sfn|Cohen|2004|p=60}} but Disney later campaigned successfully for an Honorary Academy Award for its star, [[James Baskett]], the first black actor so honored.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=43839}}{{efn|Baskett died shortly afterward, and his widow wrote Disney a letter of gratitude for his support.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=43839}}}} Gabler argues that "Walt Disney was no racist. He never, either publicly or privately, made disparaging remarks about blacks or asserted white superiority. Like most white Americans of his generation, however, he was racially insensitive."{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=433}} [[Floyd Norman]], the studio's first black animator who worked closely with Disney during the 1950s and 1960s, said, "Not once did I observe a hint of the racist behavior Walt Disney was often accused of after his death. His treatment of people{{nsmdns}}and by this I mean all people{{nsmdns}}can only be called exemplary."{{sfn|Korkis|2012|p=xi}}

Watts argues that many of Disney's post World War II films "legislated a kind of cultural [[Marshall Plan]]. They nourished a genial cultural imperialism that magically overran the rest of the globe with the values, expectations, and goods of a prosperous middle-class United States."{{sfn|Watts|1995|p=107}} Film historian Jay P. Telotte acknowledges that many see Disney's studio as an "agent of manipulation and repression", although he observes that it has "labored throughout its history to link its name with notions of fun, family, and fantasy".{{sfn|Telotte|2008|p=19}} John Tomlinson, in his study ''Cultural Imperialism'', examines the work of [[Ariel Dorfman]] and [[Armand Mattelart]], whose 1971 book {{lang|es|Para leer al Pato Donald}} (trans: ''[[How to Read Donald Duck]]'') identifies that there are "imperialist&amp;nbsp;... values 'concealed' behind the innocent, wholesome faade of the world of Walt Disney"; this, they argue, is a powerful tool as "it presents itself as harmless fun for consumption by children."{{sfn|Tomlinson|2001|p=41}} Tomlinson views their argument as flawed, as "they simply ''assume'' that reading American comics, seeing adverts, watching pictures of the affluent&amp;nbsp;... ['[[Yankee]]'] lifestyle has a direct pedagogic effect".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2001|p=44}}

Several commentators have described Disney as a [[cultural icon]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mannheim|1y=2016|1p=40|2a1=Krasniewicz|2y=2010|2p=xxii|3a1=Watts|3y=2013|3p=58| 4a1=Painter| 4y=2008|4p=25}} On his death, journalism professor Ralph S. Izard comments that the values in Disney's films are those "considered valuable in American Christian society", which include "individualism, decency,&amp;nbsp;... love for our fellow man, fair play and toleration".&lt;ref name="Izard: Master" /&gt; Disney's obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' calls the films "wholesome, warm-hearted and entertaining&amp;nbsp;... of incomparable artistry and of touching beauty".&lt;ref name="Times: Obit" /&gt; Journalist [[Bosley Crowther]] argues that Disney's "achievement as a creator of entertainment for an almost unlimited public and as a highly ingenious merchandiser of his wares can rightly be compared to the most successful industrialists in history."&lt;ref name="EB: Crowther" /&gt; Correspondent [[Alistair Cooke]] calls Disney a "folk-hero&amp;nbsp;... the Pied Piper of Hollywood",&lt;ref name="Guard: Cooke" /&gt; while Gabler considers Disney "reshaped the culture and the American consciousness".{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=x}} In the ''American Dictionary of National Biography'', Langer writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Disney remains the central figure in the history of animation. Through technological innovations and alliances with governments and corporations, he transformed a minor studio in a marginal form of communication into a multinational leisure industry giant. Despite his critics, his vision of a modern, corporate utopia as an extension of traditional American values has possibly gained greater currency in the years after his death.{{sfn|Langer|2000}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
