'''Lionel Andrs Messi Cuccittini'''{{refn|group=note|According to his club's official website, FCBarcelona.com, and his authorised biography, ''Messi'' by [[Guillem Balagu]], his surname is the single "Messi", in accordance with Argentine customs.&lt;ref name="Profile: Lionel Andrs Messi"&gt;{{cite web |title=Profile: Lionel Andrs Messi |publisher=FC Barcelona |url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/staff/players/messi |accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=3237}} Other sources, including a 2014 document by [[FIFA]], give his surname as the double "Messi Cuccittini".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil: List of Players |publisher=FIFA |date=10 June 2014 |format=PDF |page=2 |url=http://resources.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/02/36/33/44/fwc_2014_squadlists_neutral.pdf |accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After winning a libel case in 2017, Messi's own management company stated: "The football player Lionel Andres Messi Cuccittini has donated a total of 72,783.20 to the organisation Doctors Without Borders."&lt;ref name="ActualName"/&gt;}}{{refn|group=note|According to Milan Sufflay, the surname ''Messi'' comes from Meksi, Mexi, Mesi family originated from ''mjek''meaning Doctorin Albanian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://fedhonmeksi.com/Libri.pdf|last1=Meksi|first1=Fedhon|title=Labova dhe Labovitt|date=2010|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://po.al/me-24-qershor-te-1987-lindi-fenomeni-lionel-messi/|publisher=PO.al|title=Me 24 qershor t 1987 lindi fenomeni Lionel Messi|date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkanweb.com/site/messi-me-origjine-shqiptare-perparim-kabo-permend-faktet-ja-pse-nuk-eshte-cudi/|publisher=Balkanweb|date=6 March 2018|title=Messi me origjin shqiptare, Prparim Kabo prmend faktet: Ja pse nuk sht udi!}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} ({{IPA-es|ljonel andez mesi|-|Lionel Andrs Messi - Name.ogg}};{{efn-ua|In isolation, ''Andrs'' is pronounced {{IPA-es|andes|}}.}} born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for Spanish club [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and the [[Argentina national football team|Argentine national team]]. Often considered the best player in the world and regarded by many as the greatest of all time,&lt;ref name="Telegraph 2016"/&gt; Messi has a record-tying five [[Ballon d'Or]] awards,{{refn|group=note|In addition to four FIFA Ballons d'Or, Messi received ''[[France Football]]''{{'}}s [[Ballon d'Or]] and [[FIFA]]'s [[FIFA World Player of the Year|World Player of the Year award]] prior to their fusion; both organisations credit him with five (FIFA) Ballons d'Or.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Rmy |last=Lacombe |title=Messi, le Cinquime lment |magazine=France Football |date=11 January 2016 |url=http://www.francefootball.fr/news/messi-le-cinquieme-element/623615 |accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Messi, Lloyd, Luis Enrique and Ellis Triumph at FIFA Ballon d'Or 2015 |publisher=FIFA |date=11 January 2016 |url=https://www.fifa.com/news/y=2016/m=1/news=messi-lloyd-luis-enrique-and-ellis-triumph-at-fifa-ballon-d-or-2015-2754944.html |accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} four of which he won consecutively, and a record five [[European Golden Shoe]]s. He has spent [[List of one-club men|his entire professional career]] with Barcelona, where he has won 32 trophies, including nine [[La Liga]] titles, four [[UEFA Champions League]] titles, and six [[Copas del Rey]]. Both a prolific goalscorer and a creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most official goals scored in [[List of La Liga top scorers#All-time top scorers|La Liga]] (383), [[List of La Liga top scorers#Top scorers in La Liga by seasons|a La Liga season]] (50), [[European association football club records#Most goals in a season|a club football season in Europe]] (73), a calendar year (91), [[El Clsico#Top goalscorers|El Clsico]] (26), as well as those for most assists in La Liga (149) and the [[Copa Amrica]] (11). He has scored over [[List of men's footballers with 500 or more goals|600 senior career goals]] for club and country.

Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi was diagnosed with a [[growth hormone deficiency]] as a child. At age 13, he relocated to Spain to join Barcelona, who agreed to pay for his medical treatment. After a fast progression through Barcelona's youth academy, Messi made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. Despite being injury-prone during his early career, he established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, finishing 2007 as a finalist for both the [[Ballon d'Or]] and [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] award, a feat he repeated the following year. His first uninterrupted campaign came in the 200809 season, during which he helped Barcelona achieve the first [[Treble (association football)|treble]] in Spanish football. At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award by record voting margins.

Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning three consecutive FIFA Ballon d'Ors, including an unprecedented fourth. His personal best campaign statistically to date was the 201112 season, in which he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as [[List of FC Barcelona records and statistics#Records|Barcelona's all-time top scorer]] in official competitions in March 2012. The following two seasons, Messi finished twice second for the Ballon d'Or behind [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], his perceived [[MessiRonaldo rivalry|career rival]]. Messi regained his best form during the 201415 campaign, breaking the all-time goalscoring records in both La Liga and the [[List of European Cup and UEFA Champions League top scorers#All-time top scorers|Champions League]] in November 2014,{{refn|group=note|Since surpassed by Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi is the second-highest goalscorer in the European Cup/Champions League as of April 2018.}} and led Barcelona to a historic second treble.

An Argentine international, Messi is his country's [[Argentina national football team#Top goalscorers|all-time leading goalscorer]]. At youth level, he won the [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship]], finishing the tournament with both the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup#Awards|Golden Ball and Golden Shoe]], and an [[Olympic medal|Olympic gold medal]] at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics]]. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbler]] drew comparisons with compatriot [[Diego Maradona]], who declared the teenager his [[New Maradona|successor]]. After making his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a [[FIFA World Cup]] during the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 edition]], and reached the final of the [[2007 Copa Amrica]], where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's [[Captain (association football)|captain]] from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]], for which he won the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Ball|Golden Ball]], and the [[2015 Copa Amrica|2015]] and [[Copa Amrica Centenario|2016 Copas Amrica]]. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]].

==Early life==
[[File:Messi trofeo infantil 1992.jpg|thumb|left|180px|5-year-old Lionel Messi with Club Abanderado Grandoli of Rosario, where he started to play football]]
Lionel Andrs Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]], the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and [[Spaniards|Spanish]] descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the northcentral Adriatic [[Marche]] region of Italy and [[Catalonia]], and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=3237}} Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matas, and his cousins, [[Maxi Biancucchi|Maximiliano]] and [[Emanuel Biancucchi]], both of whom became professional footballers.{{sfn|Caioli|2012|pp=910}} At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.&lt;ref name="Magic in His Feet"&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Carlin |title=Lionel Messi: Magic in His Feet |newspaper=The Independent |date=27 March 2010 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/lionel-messi-magic-in-his-feet-1928768.html |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute of his grandmother.{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=4445}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Maume |title=Lionel Messi: The World at His Feet |newspaper=The Independent |date=11 July 2014 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/lionel-messi-the-world-at-his-feet-9601215.html |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lifelong supporter of [[Newell's Old Boys]], Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of "The Machine of '87", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games.&lt;ref name="Here and Gone"&gt;{{cite web |first=Wright |last=Thompson |title=Here and Gone: The Strange Relationship between Lionel Messi and His Hometown in Argentina |work=Outside the Lines |publisher=ESPN FC |date=22 October 2012 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=lionel-messi |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Caioli|2012|pp=3135}} However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, at age 10, he was diagnosed with a [[growth hormone deficiency]]. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of [[growth hormone treatment]], which cost at least [[Argentine peso|$]]1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.&lt;ref name="The Legend of El Enano"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Jrme |last1=Cazadieu |first2=Alexandre |last2=Juillard |first3=Frdric |last3=Trani |title=Leo Messi: La Lgende d'El Enano |trans-title=Leo Messi: The Legend of El Enano |newspaper=L'quipe via Irish Independent |date=15 November 2008 |url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/rosario-the-old-coach-and-the-kid-26496103.html |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was scouted by Buenos Aires club [[Club Atltico River Plate|River Plate]], whose [[playmaker]], [[Pablo Aimar]], he idolised, but they were also unable to pay for his treatment due to the country's [[19982002 Argentine great depression|economic collapse]].&lt;ref name="On a Mission"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Hawkey |title=Lionel Messi on a Mission |newspaper=The Times {{subscription required}} |date=20 April 2008 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article3779961.ece |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830020412/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article3779961.ece |archivedate=30 August 2008 |deadurl=no |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pablo Aimar: The Argentinian Wizard Admired by Maradona and Messi"&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Wilson |title=Pablo Aimar: The Argentinian Wizard Admired by Maradona and Messi |newspaper=The Guardian |date=16 July 2015 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jul/16/pablo-aimar-next-diego-maradona-argentina-retired-age-35-valencia |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La Masia (Can Planas) (Barcelona) - 1.jpg|thumb|left|Messi enrolled at Barcelona's youth academy, [[La Masia]], at age 13]]

As the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in September 2000. First team director [[Carles Rexach|Charly Rexach]] immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.&lt;ref name="On a Mission"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How Argentinian Teenager Signed for Barcelona on a Serviette"&gt;{{cite news |first=Sid |last=Lowe |title=Lionel Messi: How Argentinian Teenager Signed for Barcelona on a Serviette |newspaper=The Guardian |date=15 October 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/oct/15/lionel-messi-barcelona-decade |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, [[Camp Nou]]. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the ''Infantiles'' due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, Mara Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.&lt;ref name="Here and Gone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="How Argentinian Teenager Signed for Barcelona on a Serviette"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boy Genius"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jer |last=Longman |title=Lionel Messi: Boy Genius |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 May 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/22/sports/soccer/lionel-messi-boy-genius.html |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a year at Barcelona's youth academy, [[La Masia]], Messi was finally enrolled in the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation]] (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were [[Cesc Fbregas]] and [[Gerard Piqu]].{{sfn|Caioli|2012|pp=6162}} After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14,{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=149}} Messi became an integral part of the "Baby Dream Team", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (200203), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the ''Cadetes'' A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups.{{sfn|Caioli|2012|pp=6162}}&lt;ref name="Class of 2002"&gt;{{cite news |first=Pete |last=Jenson |title=Fbregas, Messi, Piqu: Class of 2002 |newspaper=The Independent |date=27 March 2010 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/fabregas-messi-pique-class-of-2002-1928682.html |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Copa Catalunya final, a 41 victory over [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]], became known in club lore as the ''partido de la mscara'', the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution.{{sfn|Hunter|2012|pp=4445}} At the close of the season, he received an offer to join [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], his first from a foreign club, but while Fbregas and Piqu soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.&lt;ref name="How Argentinian Teenager Signed for Barcelona on a Serviette"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lionel Messi Could Have Joined Arsenal as a Teenager, Says Arsne Wenger |newspaper=The Guardian |date=21 November 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/21/arsenal-arsene-wenger-lionel-messi-barcelona |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The New Messiah"&gt;{{cite web |title=The New Messiah |publisher=FIFA |date=5 March 2006 |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/clubworldcup/japan2006/news/newsid=103182/index.html |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''Clsico'' on 2 May 2009, however, he played for the first time as a [[Forward (association football)#False 9|false nine]], positioned as a centre-forward but dropping deep into midfield to link up with [[Xavi]] and [[Andrs Iniesta]]. He assisted with a [[Chip (association football)|chip]] his side's first goal and scored twice to end the match in an emphatic 62 victory, the team's greatest-ever score at Real Madrid's [[Santiago Bernabu Stadium]].{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=453459}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Real Madrid v Barcelona: Six of the Best 'El Clsicos' |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=9 December 2011 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/la-liga/8946213/Real-Madrid-v-Barcelona-six-of-the-best-El-Clasicos.html |accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to the wing, he played his first final since breaking into the first team on 13 May, scoring once and assisting a second goal as Barcelona defeated [[Athletic Bilbao]] [[2009 Copa del Rey Final|41]] to win the Copa del Rey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Barcelona Defeat Athletic Bilbao to Win Copa del Rey |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=14 May 2009 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/european/5321324/Barcelona-defeat-Athletic-Bilbao-to-win-Copa-del-Rey.html |accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With 23 league goals from Messi that season, Barcelona became [[200809 La Liga|La Liga champions]] three days later and achieved its fifth [[Double (association football)|double]].&lt;ref name="Matches 200809"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Barcelona's Title Celebrations Marred by Violence |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=17 May 2009 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/european/5338604/Barcelonas-title-celebrations-marred-by-violence.html |accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==

===200405: Success at youth level===
As a dual Argentine-Spanish national, Messi was eligible to play for the national team of both countries.&lt;ref name="The Burden of Being Messi"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeff |last=Himmelman |title=The Burden of Being Messi |newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 June 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/08/magazine/the-burden-of-being-messi.html|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selectors for Spain's Under-17 squad began pursuing him in 2003 after Barcelona's director of football, [[Carles Rexach]], alerted the Royal Spanish Football Federation to their young player. Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent ''La Albiceleste'' since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the [[Argentine Football Association]] organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in [[FIFA]]. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 80 victory. He was subsequently included in the squad for the [[2005 South American U-20 Championship|South American Youth Championship]], held in Colombia in February 2005. As he lacked the stamina of his teammates, the result of his former growth hormone deficiency, he was used as a substitute in six of the nine games, proving more effective when coming on in the second half. After being named man of the match against Venezuela, he scored the winning 21 goal in the crucial last match against Brazil, thereby securing their third-place qualification for the [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship|FIFA World Youth Championship]].{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=209219}}

Aware of his physical limitations, Messi employed a personal trainer to increase his muscle mass, returning to the squad in an improved condition in time for the World Youth Championship, hosted by the Netherlands in June 2005. After he was left out of the starting line-up in their first match against the United States, a 10 defeat, the squad's senior players asked manager Francisco Ferraro to let Messi start, as they considered him their best player. After helping the team defeat Egypt and Germany to progress past the group stage, Messi proved decisive in the knockout phase as he scored their equaliser against Colombia, provided a goal and an assist against title favourites Spain, and scored their opening goal against reigning champions Brazil. Ahead of the final, he was awarded the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup#Awards|Golden Ball]] as the best player of the tournament. He scored two penalties in their 21 victory over Nigeria, clinching Argentina's fifth championship and finishing the tournament as top scorer with 6 goals.{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=220240}}&lt;ref name="Magic Messi Sparks High Drama in the Lowlands"&gt;{{cite web |title=Magic Messi Sparks High Drama in the Lowlands |publisher=FIFA |date=July 2005 |url=https://www.fifa.com/u20worldcup/news/y=2007/m=3/news=magic-messi-sparks-high-drama-the-lowlands-501784.html |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performances drew comparisons with compatriot [[Diego Maradona]], who had led Argentina to the [[1979 FIFA World Youth Championship|title in 1979]].&lt;ref name="Magic Messi Sparks High Drama in the Lowlands"/&gt;

In recognition of his achievements with the under-20 side, senior manager [[Jos Pkerman]] gave Messi his first call-up for a friendly against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] on 17 August 2005. Aged 18, Messi made his senior debut for Argentina when he came on in the 63rd minute, only to be sent off after two minutes for a perceived foul against [[Vilmos Vanczk]], who had grabbed his shirt; Messi had struck the defender with his arm while trying to shake him off, which the referee interpreted as an intentional elbowing, a contentious decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tim |last=Vickery |title=Messi Handles 'New Maradona' Tag |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 August 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_football/4172400.stm |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Messi was reportedly found weeping in the dressing room after his sending-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Messi's Debut Dream Turns Sour |publisher=ESPN FC |url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/339694/messis-debut-dream-turns-sour |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the team on 3 September in their World Cup qualifier defeat to [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]], which he had declared his "re-debut" ahead of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Messi Tries Again as Argentina Face Paraguay |publisher=ESPN FC |date=2 September 2005 |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/preview?id=178848&amp;cc=5739 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628224026/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/preview?id=178848&amp;cc=5739 |archivedate=28 June 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Messi started his first game in the next qualifying match against [[Peru national football team|Peru]], in which he was able to win a crucial penalty that secured their victory.

In the next match, against [[Serbia national football team|Serbia and Montenegro]], he became the youngest player to represent Argentina at a [[FIFA World Cup]] when he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute. He assisted their fourth strike within minutes and scored the final goal in their 60 victory, making him the youngest scorer in the tournament and the sixth-youngest goalscorer in the history of the World Cup.&lt;ref name="Argentina 60 Serbia &amp; Montenegro"&gt;{{cite web |title=Argentina 60 Serbia &amp; Montenegro |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 June 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4853028.stm |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As their progression to the knockout phase was secured, several starters were rested during the last group match.

===200708: Copa Amrica final and Olympic gold===

As Messi evolved into one of the best players in the world, he secured a place in [[Alfio Basile]]'s starting line-up, as part of a team considered favourites to win the [[2007 Copa Amrica]], held in Venezuela.&lt;ref name="Messi: I'm Not the Best"/&gt;{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=384387}} He set up the game-winning goal of their 41 victory over the [[United States national men's soccer team|United States]] in the opening match, before winning a penalty that led to the game-tying first strike of their 42 win in the next match against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Argentina into Last Eight of Copa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 July 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/6263888.stm |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tevez Nets in Argentina Victory |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 June 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/6252156.stm |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As they had secured their place in the knockout phase, Messi started the next game on the bench, coming on in the last 25 minutes with the score at 00 to help his team defeat Paraguay by assisting their only goal. At the quarter-final stage, where the group winners faced Peru, he scored the second goal of a 40 victory that saw them through to the semi-final, during which he chipped the ball over Mexico's goalkeeper to ensure another 30 win.{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=384387}} In a surprise defeat, Argentina lost the final 30 to a [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] squad which lacked several of the nation's best players.&lt;ref name="Missing Some Stars, Brazil Wins Copa Amrica"&gt;{{cite news |title=Missing Some Stars, Brazil Wins Copa Amrica |newspaper=The New York Times |date=16 July 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/16/sports/soccer/16soccer.html |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their unexpected loss was followed by much criticism in Argentina, though Messi was mostly exempt due to his young age and secondary status to star player [[Juan Romn Riquelme]].{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=384387}} He was named the best young player of the tournament by [[CONMEBOL]].{{sfn|Caioli|2012|p=156}}

Ahead of the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics]], Barcelona legally barred Messi from representing Argentina at the tournament as it coincided with their Champions League qualifying matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Homewood |title=Court Blocks Messi from Olympics Soccer |agency=Reuters |date=6 August 2008 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/08/06/us-olympics-soccer-messi-idUSB29154520080806 |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After interference from newly appointed Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, who had won the [[Football at the 1992 Summer Olympics|tournament in 1992]], Messi was permitted to join [[Sergio Batista]]'s under-23 squad in Beijing.{{sfn|Hunter|2012|pp=6364}} During the first match, he scored the opening goal and assisted another in their 21 victory over the [[Ivory Coast national under-23 football team|Ivory Coast]]. Following a 10 win in the next group match against [[Australia national under-23 soccer team|Australia]], ensuring their quarter-final qualification, Messi was rested during the game against Serbia, while his side won the match to finish first in their group. Against the Netherlands, he again scored the first goal and assisted a second strike to help his team to a 21 win in extra time. After a 30 semi-final victory over [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil]], Messi assisted the only goal in the final as Argentina defeated [[Nigeria national under-23 football team|Nigeria]] to claim [[Olympic medal|Olympic gold medal]]s.{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=436437}} Along with Riquelme, Messi was singled out by FIFA as the stand-out player from the tournament's best team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Report and Statistics: Men's and Women's Olympic Football Tournaments Beijing 2008 |publisher=FIFA |p=21 |format=PDF |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/afdeveloping/technicaldevp/94/37/67/internetreportoly08v2.pdf |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===200811: Collective decline===
From late 2008, the national team experienced a three-year period marked by poor performances.{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=384387}} Under manager Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to World Cup victory as a player, the team struggled to qualify for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], securing their place in the tournament only after defeating [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] 10 in their last qualifying match. Maradona was criticised for his strategic decisions as he played Messi out of position, positioned too deep for him to be able to contribute to the attack to his full ability. In eight qualifying matches under Maradona's stewardship, Messi scored only one goal, netting the opening goal in the first such match, a 40 victory over [[Venezuela national football team|Venezuela]].&lt;ref name="Century of International Appearances"/&gt;{{sfn|Lisi|2011|pp=533539}} During that game, played on 28 March 2009, he wore Argentina's number 10 shirt for the first time, following the international retirement of Riquelme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Chadband |title=Lionel Messi Can Achieve More at Barcelona than Diego Maradona |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=28 April 2009 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/5231676/Lionel-Messi-can-achieve-more-at-Barcelona-than-Diego-Maradona.html |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Messi scored four goals in 18 appearances during the qualifying process.&lt;ref name="Century of International Appearances"/&gt; Ahead of the tournament, Maradona visited Messi in Barcelona to request his tactical input; Messi then outlined a 4312 formation with himself playing behind the two strikers, a playmaking position known as the ''enganche'' in Argentine football, which had been his preferred position since childhood.{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=155156, 405406}}

[[File:Messi Copa America 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Messi in action during the opening match against Bolivia in the [[2011 Copa Amrica]]]]

Despite their poor qualifying campaign, Argentina were considered title contenders at the World Cup in South Africa. At the start of the tournament, the new formation proved effective; Messi managed at least four attempts on goal during their opening match but was repeatedly denied by [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]]'s goalkeeper, resulting in a 10 win. During the next match, against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]], he excelled in his playmaking role, participating in all four goals of his side's 41 victory. As their place in the knockout phase was guaranteed, most of the starters were rested during the last group match, but Messi reportedly refused to be benched.{{sfn|Lisi|2011|pp=533539}} He wore the captain's armband for the first time in their 20 win against [[Greece national football team|Greece]]; as the focal point of their play, he helped create their second goal to see Argentina finish as group winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rory |last=Smith |title=Greece 0 Argentina 2: Match Report |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=22 June 2010 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/news/7842201/Greece-0-Argentina-2-match-report.html |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rex |last=Gowar |title=Messi Captains Argentina for First Time |agency=Reuters |date=22 June 2010 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/06/22/us-soccer-world-greece-argentina-teams-idUSTRE65L4TE20100622 |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the round of 16, they defeated Mexico 31, with Messi assisting their first goal, a controversial strike that stood despite being offside.{{sfn|Lisi|2011|pp=564567}}

Argentina's unstructured defence had proved a liability throughout the World Cup and finally led to their elimination in the quarter-final against Germany, at the same stage of the tournament and by the same opponent as four years earlier. Their 40 loss was their worst margin of defeat since 1974.{{sfn|Lisi|2011|pp=564567}} FIFA subsequently identified Messi as one of the tournament's 10 best players, citing his "outstanding" pace and creativity and "spectacular and efficient" dribbling, shooting and passing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Adidas Golden Ball Nominees Announced |publisher=FIFA |date=9 July 2010 |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2010/m=7/news=adidas-golden-ball-nominees-announced-1270753.html |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back home, however, Messi was the subject of far harsher judgement. As the perceived best player in the world, he had been expected to lead an average team to the title, as Maradona arguably [[1986 FIFA World Cup|did in 1986]], but he had failed to replicate his performances at Barcelona with the national team, leading to the accusation that he cared less about his country than his club.{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=414420}}&lt;ref name="Holland vs Argentina: How Coach Alejandro Sabella Persuaded Lionel Messi Not to Quit the National Team"&gt;{{cite news |first=Guillem |last=Balagu |title=Holland vs Argentina: How Coach Alejandro Sabella Persuaded Lionel Messi Not to Quit the National Team |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=8 July 2014 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/argentina/10954975/Holland-vs-Argentina-How-coach-Alejandro-Sabella-persuaded-Lionel-Messi-not-to-quit-the-national-team.html |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maradona was replaced by Sergio Batista, who had orchestrated Argentina's Olympic victory. Batista publicly stated that he intended to build the team around Messi, employing him as a [[Forward (association football)#False 9|false nine]] within a 433 system, as used to much success by Barcelona.{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=414420}}&lt;ref name="Lionel Messi Showing Some Promising Signs in a New Argentina Role"&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Cox |title=Lionel Messi Showing Some Promising Signs in a New Argentina Role |publisher=ESPN FC |date=13 November 2014 |url=http://www.espnfc.com/blog/tactics-and-analysis/67/post/2144957/argentina-national-team-lionel-messi-showing-some-promising-signs-in-a-new-argentina-role |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Messi scored a record 53 goals during the 201011 club season, he had not scored for Argentina in an official match since March 2009.&lt;ref name="Matches 201011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Century of International Appearances"/&gt; Despite the tactical change, his goal drought continued during the [[2011 Copa Amrica]], hosted by Argentina. Their first two matches, against Bolivia and Colombia, ended in draws, with Messi underperforming by his standards. Media and fans noted that he did not combine well with striker [[Carlos Tevez]], who enjoyed far greater popularity among the Argentine public; Messi was consequently booed by his own team's supporters for the first time in his career. During the crucial next match, with Tevez on the bench, he gave a well-received performance, assisting two goals in their 30 victory over [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]. After the quarter-final against Uruguay ended in a 11 draw following extra time, with Messi having assisted their equaliser, Argentina were eliminated 45 in the penalty shootout by the eventual champions.{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=414420}}

===201113: Assuming the captaincy===

After Argentina's unsuccessful performance in the Copa Amrica, Batista was replaced by [[Alejandro Sabella]]. Upon his appointment in August 2011, Sabella awarded the 24-year-old Messi the captaincy of the squad, in accord with then-captain [[Javier Mascherano]]. Reserved by nature, Messi went on to lead his squad by example as their best player, while Mascherano continued to fulfil the role of the team's on-field leader and motivator.{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=595602}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rob |last=Hughes |title=If Messi Is Argentina's Star, Then Mascherano Is the Glue |newspaper=The New York Times |date=10 July 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/sports/soccer/if-messi-is-argentinas-star-then-mascherano-is-the-glue.html |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a further redesign of the team, Sabella dismissed Tevez and brought in players with whom Messi had won the World Youth Championship and Olympic Games. Now playing in a free role in an improving team, Messi finally ended his goal drought by scoring during their first World Cup qualifying match against [[Chile national football team|Chile]] on 7 October, his first official goal for Argentina in two-and-a-half years.&lt;ref name="Century of International Appearances"/&gt;{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=595602}}

Under Sabella, Messi's goalscoring rate drastically increased; where he had scored only 17 goals in 61 matches under his previous managers, he scored 25 times in 32 appearances during the following three years.&lt;ref name="Century of International Appearances"/&gt;{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=595602}} He netted a total of 12 goals in 9 games for Argentina in 2012, equalling the record held by [[Gabriel Batistuta]], Argentina's all-time top scorer, for the most goals scored in a calendar year for their country.&lt;ref name="Lionel Messi's Incredible Record-Breaking Year in Numbers"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Adamson |title=Lionel Messi's Incredible Record-Breaking Year in Numbers |newspaper=The Guardian |date=10 December 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/dec/10/lionel-messi-record-year-numbers |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Bryan |title=Record-Breaking Messi Sees the Bigger Picture |publisher=UEFA |date=10 December 2012 |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=esp/news/newsid=1906190.html |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first hat-trick with the ''Albicelestes'' came in a friendly against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] on 29 February 2012, followed by two more hat-tricks over the next year-and-a-half in friendlies against Brazil and [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala]]. Messi then helped the team secure their place in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] with a 52 victory over Paraguay on 10 September 2013; in addition to providing an assist, he scored twice from a penalty kick, taking his international tally to 37 goals to become Argentina's second-highest goalscorer behind only Batistuta.

===201415: World Cup and Copa Amrica finals===
Ahead of the World Cup in Brazil, doubts persisted over Messi's form, as he finished an unsuccessful and injury-plagued season with Barcelona.

A prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line.

Tactically, Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the ''enganche'' in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a [[Association football positions#Winger|left-winger]] or [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|left-sided forward]].{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=155156, 405406}} Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager [[Frank Rijkaard]]; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and [[Curl (football)|curl]] shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly [[Cross (football)|cross]] balls for teammates.&lt;ref name="Lionel Messi (FT Magazine)"/&gt; Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a [[Forward (association football)#False 9|false nine]] role; positioned as a [[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|centre-forward]] or lone [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]], he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, dribbling runs or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta.&lt;ref name="Boy Genius"/&gt; Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career,&lt;ref name="Motivated Lionel Messi Transforms Barcelona's Hopes for Trophy Treble"/&gt; while also being deployed in a deeper, free role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=esp/news/newsid=2236364.html |title=In focus: Messi's changing role |publisher=UEFA |author=Richard Martin |date=19 April 2015 |accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, or in a deeper, creative role as a classic number 10 or [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]].&lt;ref name="Lionel Messi Showing Some Promising Signs in a New Argentina Role"/&gt;

===Reception===
A prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world's best players before age 20.&lt;ref name="Messi: I'm Not the Best"/&gt; Diego Maradona considered the 18-year-old Messi the best player in the world alongside [[Ronaldinho]], while the Brazilian himself, shortly after winning the [[Ballon d'Or]], commented, "I'm not even the best at Bara," in reference to his protg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Maradona Hails Messi as Successor |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 February 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/4746070.stm |accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Phil |last=Ball |title=Britain v Spain (Sort Of) |publisher=ESPN FC |date=23 February 2006 |url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/359600 |accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, after Messi had won his first Ballon d'Or by a record margin,{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=519524}} the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was the greatest player in history.&lt;ref name="Magic in His Feet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arsenal v Barcelona: Lionel Messi Making Case for World's Greatest Ever Player"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Phil |last=Minshull |title=Is Messi the Greatest Ever? |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 March 2010 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/philminshull/2010/03/is_messi_the_greatest_ever.html |accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early proponent was his then-manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Messi Es el Mejor Jugador que Ver Jams |trans-title='Messi Is the Best Player I Have Ever Seen' |newspaper=El Mundo |language=Spanish |date=29 August 2009 |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundodeporte/2009/08/29/futbol/1251499664.html |accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players,&lt;ref name="Is Sublime Lionel Messi the Greatest Footballer Ever?"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lionel Messi: Is the Barcelona and Argentina Star the Greatest Player Ever? |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=29 May 2011 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/players/lionel-messi/8545361/Lionel-Messi-is-the-Barcelona-and-Argentina-star-the-greatest-player-ever.html |accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the end of Bara's second treble-winning season, Messi's superiority, ahead of Maradona and [[Pel]], had become the predominant view among insiders in continental Europe.&lt;ref name="Telegraph 2016"&gt;{{cite news |agency=Agence France-Presse |title=Magical Messi Grabs Hat-trick in Copa America as Argentina Romp into Quarters |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=11 June 2016 |quote=Widely regarded as the best footballer of all time, Lionel Messi ... has sublime balance and is able to dribble past defenders with almost inhuman ease. |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/06/11/magical-messi-grabs-hat-trick-in-copa-america-as-argentina-romp/ |accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lionel Messi: Is the Barcelona Forward the Greatest of Them All?"&gt;{{cite news |first=Pete |last=Jenson |title=Lionel Messi: Is the Barcelona Forward the Greatest of Them All? |newspaper=The Independent |date=30 May 2015 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/lionel-messi-is-the-barcelona-forward-the-greatest-of-them-all-10287066.html |accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A frequent dismissal, however, has centred on the fact that Messi has not won the [[FIFA World Cup]] with Argentina, leading some in the sport to instead cite him as the best club player in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dan |last=Cairns |title=How Does Lionel Messi Stack up against Football Legends? |publisher=BBC Newsbeat |date=8 January 2013 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/20943498/how-does-lionel-messi-stack-up-against-football-legends |accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his career, Messi has been compared with his compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers. Initially, he was merely one of many young Argentine players, including his boyhood idol [[Pablo Aimar]], to receive the "[[New Maradona]]" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player Argentina had produced since Maradona.&lt;ref name="Pablo Aimar: The Argentinian Wizard Admired by Maradona and Messi"/&gt;{{sfn|Lisi|2011|pp=533539}} [[Jorge Valdano]], who won the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] alongside Maradona, said in October 2013, "Messi is Maradona every day.

In Argentine society, Messi is generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona, a consequence of not only his uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi is in some ways the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football.&lt;ref name="The Burden of Being Messi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jer |last=Longman |title=Adept?

As a commercial entity, Messi's marketing brand has been based exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Cristiano Ronaldo and [[David Beckham]].

===Family and relationships===
Since 2008, when he was 20, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonella Roccuzzo, a fellow native of [[Rosario]].

Messi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Matas, manage his charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=31, 143, 570}}

Since leaving for Spain at age 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of "The Machine of '87" at Newell's Old Boys. Although considered a [[List of one-club men|one-club man]], he has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell's embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son.&lt;ref name="Here and Gone"/&gt;{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=576577}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Wright |title=After Just 72 Hours on the Planet, Thiago Messi Signs for Newell's Old Boys |publisher=ESPN FC |date=5 November 2012 |url=http://www.espnfc.com/blog/the-toe-poke/65/post/1850358/after-just-72-hours-on-the-planet-thiago-messi-signs-for-newells-old-boys |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity===
Throughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the [[UNICEF|United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association.&lt;ref name="Leo Messi: Goodwill Ambassador"&gt;{{cite web |title=Leo Messi: Goodwill Ambassador |publisher=UNICEF |date=25 May 2012 |url=http://www.unicef.org/people/people_52964.html |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Iain |last=Rogers |first2=Justin |last2=Palmer |title=Barcelona Extend UNICEF Shirt Deal to 2016 |agency=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/12/us-soccer-spain-barcelona-unicef-idUSBRE9AB0NZ20131112 |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Messi has served as a [[List of UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors|UNICEF goodwill ambassador]] since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|recent earthquake]]. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Leo Messi Activity Highlights |publisher=UNICEF |date=14 May 2015 |url=http://www.unicef.org/people/people_52965.html |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Leo Messi's Son Turns One and Celebrates with UNICEF |publisher=UNICEF (press release) |date=28 October 2013 |url=http://www.unicef.org/media/media_70751.html |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cristina Fernndez y la Seleccin Argentina de ftbol 2014 ,3 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Messi pictured in July 2014]]
In addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lionel Messi Fast Facts |publisher=CNN |date=25 June 2015 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/07/08/world/europe/lionel-messi-fast-facts/ |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society.{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=576577}} Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world.{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=576577}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ooredoo, Messi Foundation Continue Expansion: Three New Mobile Health Clinics Launched in Algeria |newspaper=Arab Times |date=3 August 2015 |url=http://www.arabtimesonline.com/ooredoo-messi-foundation-continue-expansion/ |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global "Messi and Friends" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.&lt;ref name="'Lionel Messi and Friends' Soccer Tour Is One of Many Causes Argentine Superstar Supports"&gt;{{cite web |title='Lionel Messi and Friends' Soccer Tour Is One of Many Causes Argentine Superstar Supports |publisher=New England Sports Network |date=22 June 2012 |url=http://nesn.com/2012/06/lionel-messi-and-friends-soccer-tour-is-one-of-many-causes-argentine-superstar-supports/ |accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Partners |publisher=Leo Messi Foundation |url=http://www.fundacionleomessi.org/nuestros-partners/ |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Messi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club [[Rosario Central]], as well as at [[Club Atltico River Plate|River Plate]] and [[Boca Juniors]] in Buenos Aires.{{sfn|Balagu|2013|pp=576577}} At Newell's Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's [[Estadio Marcelo Bielsa|stadium]] for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players.&lt;ref name="Here and Gone"/&gt; On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against [[La Razn (Madrid)|''La Razn'' newspaper]] and was awarded 65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity [[Mdecins Sans Frontires|Doctors without Borders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/spanish-primera-division/story/2887818/argentinas-lionel-messi-wins-libel-case-and-donates-damages-to-charity |title=Argentina's Lionel Messi wins libel case, donates damages to charity |publisher=ESPN FC |date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/messi-wins-case-against-razon-newspaper-5185823 |title=Messi wins a case against 'La Razon' newspaper |work=Sport |date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal issues===
Messi's financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were allegedly used to evade 4.1&amp;nbsp;million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama, set up in 2012, was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the [[Panama Papers]] data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of 5.1&amp;nbsp;million in August 2013. He stood trial alongside his father on three counts of tax evasion in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mauritius |last=Much |first2=Bastian |last2=Obermayer |title=The Small Kaiser |newspaper=Sddeutsche Zeitung |date=5 April 2016 |url=http://panamapapers.sueddeutsche.de/articles/57021852a1bb8d3c3495b438/ |accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed [[Suspended sentence|suspended]] 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay 1.7&amp;nbsp;million and 1.4&amp;nbsp;million in fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2016/07/06/lionel-messi-tax-fraud-prison-jail-sentence |title=Messi, father guilty of tax fraud, given suspended 21-month sentences |work=Sports Illustrated |date=6 July 2016 |accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the District Attorney did not consider there to be motives to accuse Messi, the state lawyer's office became the only party that requested a punishment for him, despite his declarations that he was not aware of any of the deals that were taking place with his money. Facing the judge, he said, "I just played football."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.espnfc.com/spanish-primera-division/story/2884966/barcelonas-lionel-messi-in-tax-court-i-played-football-and-trusted-my-dad |title=Barcelona's Lionel Messi in tax court: I played football and trusted my father |work=ESPN FC |date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, 30 - 23 = 7 Spanish Super Cup titles. This means that the 2005 edition of Spanish Super Cup DOES COUNT in Messi's trophy collection. Lionel Messi did receive a winners medal in 2005 Spanish Super Cup. I have provided all the valid and reliable sources, both main and secondary ones. 30 trophies include 2005 Super Copa de Espaa, this is a FACT. --&gt; [[2005 Supercopa de Espaa|2005]],{{#tag:ref|See:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/news/2016-2017/iniesta-and-messi-30-trophies-as-fc-barcelona-players|title=Iniesta and Messi, 30 trophies as Bara players {{!}} FC Barcelona|website=FC Barcelona|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/02/27/zlatan-ibrahimovics-32nd-trophy-win-decorated-players-football/lionel-messi/|title=After Zlatan Ibrahimovic's 32nd trophy win, who are the most decorated players in football?|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-03-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/hes-won-trophies-but-this-was-also-lionel-messis-first-5330694|title=He's won 29 trophies... but this was also Lionel Messi's first|last=Sport|date=2016-08-18|work=sport|access-date=2018-03-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} [[2006 Supercopa de Espaa|2006]], [[2009 Supercopa de Espaa|2009]], [[2010 Supercopa de Espaa|2010]], [[2011 Supercopa de Espaa|2011]], [[2013 Supercopa de Espaa|2013]], [[2016 Supercopa de Espaa|2016]]
