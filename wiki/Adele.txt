'''Adele Laurie Blue Adkins''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|MBE}} ({{IPAc-en|||d||l}}; born 5 May 1988) is an English singer and songwriter. After graduating from the [[BRIT School]] for Performing Arts and Technology in 2006, Adele was given a recording contract by [[XL Recordings]] after a friend posted her demo on [[Myspace]] the same year. In 2007, she received the [[Brit Awards]] "Critics' Choice" award and won the [[BBC]] [[Sound of 2008]] poll. Her debut album, ''[[19 (Adele album)|19]]'', was released in 2008 to commercial and critical success. It is certified seven times [[Music recording sales certification#Certification thresholds|platinum]] in the UK, and three times platinum in the US. The album contains her first song, "[[Hometown Glory]]", written when she was 16, which is based on her home suburb of West Norwood in London. An appearance she made on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in late 2008 boosted her career in the US. At the [[51st Annual Grammy Awards|51st Grammy Awards]] in 2009, Adele received the awards for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]].

Adele released her second studio album, ''[[21 (Adele album)|21]]'', in 2011.

The album has been certified 16 times platinum in the UK, and is overall the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|fourth best-selling album in the nation]]. In the US, it has held the top position longer than any album since 1985, and is [[RIAA certification#RIAA Diamond certifications|certified diamond]]. The [[List of best-selling albums#Best-selling album by year worldwide|best-selling album worldwide]] of 2011 and 2012, ''21'' has sold over 31 million copies. The success of ''21'' earned Adele numerous mentions in the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]].'' She was the first female artist to simultaneously have two albums in the top five of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and two singles in the top five of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] as well as the first woman in the history of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 to have three simultaneous top 10 singles as a lead artist with "[[Rolling in the Deep]]", "[[Someone Like You (Adele song)|Someone Like You]]", and "[[Set Fire to the Rain]]", all of which also topped the chart. ''21'' is the longest-running number one album by a female solo artist in the history of the UK and US Album Charts.

In 2012, Adele released "[[Skyfall (Adele song)|Skyfall]]", which she co-wrote and recorded for the [[Skyfall|James Bond film of the same name]]. The song won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Academy Award]], a [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media|Grammy Award]], and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]], as well as the [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]] for British Single of the Year. After taking a three-year break, Adele released her third studio album, ''[[25 (Adele album)|25]]'', in 2015. It became the year's best-selling album and [[List of fastest-selling albums|broke first-week sales records]] in the UK and US. ''25'' was her second album to be certified diamond in the US and earned her [[59th Annual Grammy Awards|five Grammy Awards]], including her second Grammy Award for Album of the Year, and [[2016 Brit Awards|four Brit Awards]]. The lead single, "[[Hello (Adele song)|Hello]]", became the first song in the US to sell over one million digital copies within a week of its release. Her third concert tour, [[Adele Live 2016]], visited Europe, North America and Oceania, and concluded with finale concerts at [[Wembley Stadium]] in late June 2017.

In 1999 she and her mother moved back to London; first to [[Brixton]], then to the neighbouring district of [[West Norwood]] in south London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article3099702.ece|title=Adele-ation starts here |work=[[The Times]] |location=London | first=Sophie|last=Heawood|date=28 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four months after graduation, she published two songs on the fourth issue of the online arts publication ''PlatformsMagazine.com.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.platformsmagazine.com/4/contents.htm |title=Platform 04 |publisher=Platformsmagazine.com |accessdate=18 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110722121600/http://www.platformsmagazine.com/4/contents.htm| archivedate=22 July 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had recorded a three-song demo for a class project and given it to a friend.&lt;ref name=nicole /&gt; The friend posted the demo on Myspace, where it became very successful and led to a phone call from Richard Russell, boss of the music label [[XL Recordings]]. She doubted if the offer was real because the only record company she knew was [[Virgin Records]], and she took a friend with her to the meeting.&lt;ref name=collis /&gt;&lt;ref name=AdeleBillboard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid1184417216/bctid1612733606 |title=Billboard presents: Adele |publisher=Link.brightcove.com |accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nick Huggett, at XL, recommended Adele to manager Jonathan Dickins at September Management, and in June 2006, Dickins became her official representative.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Jonathan_Dickins_Interview.html |title=Interview with Jonathan Dickins |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=14 July 2008 |accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; September was managing [[Jamie T]] at the time and this proved a major draw for Adele, a big fan of the British singer-songwriter. Huggett then signed Adele to XL in September 2006.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com" /&gt; Adele provided vocals for [[Jack Peate]]'s song, "My Yvonne," for his debut album, and it was during this session she first met producer [[Jim Abbiss]], who would go on to produce both the majority of her debut album, ''19,'' and tracks on ''21.''&lt;ref name=penate&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones |first=Damian |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7986334.stm |title=Peate collaborates with Adele |publisher=BBC News |date=6 April 2009 |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007, Adele made her television debut, performing "Daydreamer" on the BBC's ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Owings|first1=Lisa|title=Adele: Grammy-Winning Singer &amp; Songwriter Lisa Owings,|date=1 January 2013|publisher=ABDO Publishing Company|page=23|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adele's breakthrough song, "[[Hometown Glory]]", was released in October 2007.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com" /&gt;
