'''Paul David Hewson''', [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] [[Order of Liberty|OL]] (born 10 May 1960), known by his stage name '''Bono''' ({{IPAc-en||b||n|o}}), is an Irish singer-songwriter, musician, [[venture capitalist]], businessman, and philanthropist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/spirit/Bono-A-Global-Rock-Star-and-Activist|title=Bono: A Global Rock Star and Activist.|work=[[Oprah.com]]|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known as the lead vocalist and primary lyricist of [[Rock music|rock]] band [[U2]].

Bono was born and raised in [[Dublin]], Ireland. He attended [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] where he met his future wife, [[Ali Hewson|Alison Stewart]], as well as schoolmates with whom he founded U2 in 1976.&lt;ref name=MacphistoNet /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ATU2Clayton /&gt;  Bono soon established himself as a passionate frontman for the band through his expressive vocal style and grandiose gestures and songwriting. His lyrics are known for their social and political themes, and for their religious imagery inspired by his [[Christianity|Christian]] beliefs.&lt;ref name=ATU2comBonoBio /&gt;&lt;ref name=Stockman /&gt; During U2's early years, Bono's lyrics contributed to the group's rebellious and spiritual tone.&lt;ref name=ATU2comBonoBio /&gt; As the band matured, his lyrics became inspired more by personal experiences shared with the other members.&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ATU2comBonoBio /&gt; As a member of U2, Bono has received 22 [[Grammy Awards]] and has been inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

Bono is widely known for his activism for social justice causes, both through U2 and as an individual. He is particularly active in campaigning for Africa, for which he co-founded DATA, [[EDUN]], the [[ONE Campaign]], and [[Product Red]].&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NationalPrayerBreakfast /&gt; In pursuit of these causes, he has participated in benefit concerts and met with influential politicians.&lt;ref name=NationalPrayerBreakfast /&gt;&lt;ref name=Time1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=05312005RollingStone /&gt; Bono has been praised for his philanthropic efforts;&lt;ref name=2006Nobel&gt;Mellgren, D.

==Early life==
Bono was born in the [[Rotunda Hospital]], Dublin, on 10 May 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bono: In the Name of Love |last=Wall |first=Mick |year=2006 |publisher=Andre Deutsch Ltd |isbn= 978-0-233-00177-7 |page= 17 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RupSPwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Bono:+In+the+Name+of+Love&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HqwoUtPtBqnQ2QWQi4CIAQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA |accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in the [[Northside (Dublin)|Northside]] suburb of [[Finglas]]&lt;ref name="Bono - Evening Herald"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/around-town/its-where-i-shaped-my-future-says-bono-3324323.html |title=It's where I shaped my future, says Bono |newspaper=[[Evening Herald]] |publisher=Herald.ie |date=12 December 2012 |accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his brother (who is eight years older than Bono) by their mother, Iris (ne Rankin), a member of the [[Church of Ireland]], and their father, Brendan Robert "Bob" Hewson, a [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref name=MacphistoNet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macphisto.net/theband/biography/bonobio.html|title=U2 BiographyBono|publisher=Macphisto.net|year=2006|accessdate=3 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt; His parents initially agreed that the first child would be raised [[Anglican]] and the second Catholic.&lt;ref name="Unforgettable Fire by Dunphy"&gt;{{cite book|title=Unforgettable Fire: The Definitive Biography of U2|first=Eamon|last=Dunphy|publisher=Warner Books|isbn=0-446-51459-4|location=New York|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bono was the second child, he also attended Church of Ireland services with his mother and brother.&lt;ref name="Unforgettable Fire by Dunphy" /&gt;

[[File:Bonavoxshop.JPG|thumb|left|The hearing aid shop, Bonavox, that provided Hewson with the nickname "Bono Vox".]]
He went to the local primary [[Glasnevin National School]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthews (2008), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Bono's mother died on 10 September 1974, after suffering a [[cerebral aneurysm]] at her father's funeral.&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt; Many U2 songs, including "[[I Will Follow]]", "[[Mofo (song)|Mofo]]", "[[Three (U2 EP)|Out of Control]]", "[[Lemon (U2 song)|Lemon]]" and "[[Tomorrow (U2 song)|Tomorrow]]" focus on the loss of his mother.&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt;&lt;ref name=010197DailyTelegraph&gt;{{cite news|title=Growing Up With U2|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Neil|last=McCormick|date=1 January 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schruers&gt;{{cite journal|title=U2: Small Victories in a Rock and Roll Struggle of Sound and Emotion Report|first=Fred|last=Schruers|date=May 1983|magazine=[[Musician (magazine)|Musician Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bono attended [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]], a multi-denominational school in [[Clontarf, Dublin|Clontarf]]. During his childhood and adolescence, Bono and his friends were part of a [[surrealist]] street gang called "Lypton Village". Bono met one of his closest friends, [[Guggi]], in Lypton Village.&lt;ref name="U2 by U2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=U2 by U2|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-077674-9|authors=Edge, Adam Clayton, Larry Mullen Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gang had a ritual of nickname-giving. Bono had several names: first, he was "Steinhegvanhuysenolegbangbangbang",&lt;ref name="U2 by U2"/&gt; then just "Huyseman", followed by "Houseman", "Bon Murray", "Bono Vox of O'Connell Street", and finally just "Bono".&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono"&gt;{{cite book|last=Assayas|first=Michka|title=Bono on Bono: Conversations with Michka Assayas|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|isbn=0-340-83276-2|location=London|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Bono Vox" is an alteration of ''Bonavox'', a [[Latin]] phrase which translates to "good voice". It is said he was nicknamed "Bono Vox" by his friend [[Gavin Friday]]. He initially disliked the name; however, when he learned it translated to "good voice", he accepted it. Hewson has been known as "Bono" since the late 1970s. Although he uses Bono as his stage name, close family and friends also refer to him as Bono, including fellow band members.&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt;

After he left school, his father Bob Hewson, told him he could live at home for one year but if he was not able to pay his own way, he would have to leave the house.&lt;ref name="U2 by U2" /&gt;

==Personal life==

Bono was a close friend to [[INXS]] frontman [[Michael Hutchence]].

Bono is almost never seen in public without sunglasses, as he suffers from [[glaucoma]].&lt;ref name=bono_glaucoma&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ellis-Petersen|first1=Hannah|title=Bono: I've had glaucoma for past 20 years|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/17/bono-glaucoma-20-years-u2-dark-glasses|accessdate=17 October 2014|work=The Guardian|date=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview he stated:

{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote="Spending time with Bono was like eating dinner on a train{{mdash}}feels like you're moving, going somewhere.

''Bob Dylan Chronicles, vol. I, Simon &amp; Schuster, N.Y. (2004) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the late 1980s or early 90s, Bono bought a top-floor duplex apartment in Manhattan's [[The San Remo|San Remo]] apartment building from [[Steve Jobs]] for $15&amp;nbsp;million. Jobs had renovated it for his own use, but never moved in.&lt;ref name=Isaacson&gt;{{cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|title=Steve Jobs|year=2011|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4516-4853-9|pages=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Bono was given an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/news/recording-artistactivist-bono-deliver-commencement-address-university-pennsylvania |title=Penn News &amp;#124; Recording Artist/Activist Bono to Deliver Commencement Address at University of Pennsylvania |publisher=Upenn.edu |date=15 March 2004 |accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Bono suffered a spinal injury while preparing for a U2 tour, and was taken to a German clinic in [[Munich]] for emergency [[neurosurgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment_and_arts/10139846.stm|title=Bono's back surgery puts U2 dates in jeopardy|publisher=The BBC|date=21 May 2010|accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="postp-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u2.com/news/title/bono-discharged-from-hospital|title=Bono Discharged From Hospital|publisher=U2.com|date=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North American leg of the tour was postponed and rescheduled for 2011.&lt;ref name="postp-2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.u2.com/news/title/north-american-leg-postponed |title=North American Leg Postponed |publisher=U2.com |date=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.u2.com/news/title/north-american-dates-will-be-rescheduled-in-2011 |title=North American Dates Will Be Rescheduled in 2011 |publisher=U2.com |date=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bono's work as an activist, which is due largely to his Christian beliefs,&lt;ref name="atu2.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atu2.com/band/bono/|title=Bono: Biography from @U2|publisher=Atu2.com|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; began in earnest when, inspired by [[Live Aid]], he travelled to Ethiopia to work in a feeding camp with his wife Alison and the charity [[World Vision]], an Evangelical Christian humanitarian aid, development, and advocacy organisation.&lt;ref name="atu2.com"/&gt; With regard to Bono's 2013 declarations in interviews published and videotaped of his faith in [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gospelherald.com/articles/50766/20140329/u2-s-bono-discusses-his-faith-and-insecurity-over-new-album.htm|title=U2's Bono Discusses His Faith and Insecurity Over New Album|work=Christian News, The Gospel Herald|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; he states that Christ was either who he said he was, or he is "a complete and utter nutcase".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnd.com/2013/06/u2s-bono-jesus-is-the-son-of-god/|title=U2's Bono: Yes, Jesus is the Son of God|work=WND|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|VIm7JRSo6w4}}, Retrieved 18 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 2005, Bono was invoking this argument,&lt;ref&gt;Michka Assayas, Bono in Conversation, (Riverhead Hardcover, 2005) page 205.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crosswalk.com/11617924/|title=Bono: Grace over Karma|work=Crosswalk|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified as the "[[Lewis's trilemma|Lewis trilemma]]".

On 16 November 2014, Bono was involved in a "high energy bicycle accident" when he attempted to avoid another rider. Bono was rushed to [[NewYorkPresbyterian Hospital]]/[[Weill Cornell Medical Center]]'s Emergency Department and underwent "multiple X-rays and CAT scans" followed by five hours of surgery. Bono suffered fractures of the shoulder blade, humerus, orbit and pinky finger. Orthopedic trauma surgeon Dean Lorich, MD, stated that "[Bono] was taken urgently to the operating room... where the elbow was washed out and debrided, a nerve trapped in the break was moved and the bone was repaired with three metal plates and 18 screws."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bono-intensive-therapy-bike-injury-20141119|title=Bono Treated With Metal Plates, 'Intensive Therapy' After Bike Injury|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=Jason|last=Newman|date=19 November 2014|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.evoke.ie/showbiz/injured-bono-keeps-his-head-down-as-hes-seen-for-the-first-time-since-emergency-surgery-after-bike-crash/ |work=evoke.ie | title= Injured Bono keeps his head down as he's seen for the first time since emergency surgery after bike crash| date= 24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bono posted to U2's official website, "As I write this, it is not clear that I will ever play guitar again," as reported in ''[[Cycling Weekly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest-news/cycling-injuries-mean-bono-may-never-play-guitar-150598|title=Cycling Injuries mean Bono May Never Play Guitar Again|publisher=Cycling Weekly|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.evoke.ie/showbiz/bonos-guitar/ |work=evoke.ie | title= Bono's guitar playing days may be over after cycling accident| date= 2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 1976, Bono, [[The Edge|David Evans ("The Edge")]], his brother [[Dik Evans|Dik]] and [[Adam Clayton]] responded to an advertisement on a bulletin board at Mount Temple posted by fellow student [[Larry Mullen, Jr.|Larry Mullen Jr.]] to form a rock band. The band had occasional jam sessions in which they did covers of other bands. Tired of long guitar solos and hard rock, Bono wanted to play [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Beach Boys]] songs.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The band could not play covers very well, so they started writing their own songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henke|first=James |title=Blessed Are the Peacemakers|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=9 June 1983 |issue=397|pages=1114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band went by the name "Feedback" for a few months, before changing to "The Hype" later on. After Dik Evans left the group to join another local band, the [[Virgin Prunes]], the remaining four officially changed the name from "The Hype" to "[[U2]]". Initially Bono sang, played guitar and wrote the band's songs. He said of his early guitar playing in a 1982 interview, "When we started out I was the guitar player, along with the Edgeexcept I couldn't play guitar. I still can't. I was such a lousy guitar player that one day they broke it to me that maybe I should sing instead. I had tried before, but I had no voice at all. I remember the day I found I could sing. I said, 'Oh, that's how you do it.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Bono in San Antonio |journal = U2 magazine |issue = 3 |date = May 1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When The Edge's guitar playing improved, Bono was relegated mostly to the microphone, although he occasionally still plays rhythm guitar and harmonica. As of 2006, Bono has taken piano lessons from his children's piano teacher as a means to improve his songwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/story/bono-takes-piano-lessons_02_06_2006 |title = U2Bono Takes Piano Lessons |publisher = [[Contactmusic.com]] |date = 6 February 2006 |accessdate = 14 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sting-Bono-Conspiracy of Hope-by Steven Toole.jpg|thumb|Bono (right) with [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] during [[A Conspiracy of Hope]] in 1986]]
Bono writes the lyrics for almost all U2 songs, which often have social and political themes.&lt;ref name=ATU2comBonoBio&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.atu2.com/band/bono/ |title = Bono: Biography from @U2 |publisher = atU2.com |accessdate = 19 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His lyrics frequently allude to a religious connection or meaning, evident in songs such as "[[Gloria (U2 song)|Gloria]]" from the band's album ''[[October (U2 album)|October]]'' and "[[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]" from ''[[The Joshua Tree]]''.&lt;ref name=Stockman&gt;Stockman (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; During the band's early years, Bono was known for his rebellious tone which turned to political anger and rage during the band's ''[[War (U2 album)|War]]'', ''The Joshua Tree'' and ''[[Rattle and Hum]]'' eras.&lt;ref name=ATU2comBonoBio /&gt; Following the [[Remembrance Day bombing|Enniskillen bombing]] that left 11 dead and 63 injured on 8 November 1987, the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] paramilitaries threatened to kidnap Bono.&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt; IRA supporters also attacked a vehicle carrying the band members.&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt; These acts were in response to his speech condemning the Enniskillen bombing during a live performance of "[[Sunday Bloody Sunday (song)|Sunday Bloody Sunday]]".&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt; The singer had been advised to cut his on-stage outburst from the ''Rattle and Hum'' film, but it was left in.&lt;ref name=RattleandHum&gt;{{cite video |people = Hamlyn, Michael (producer), and Joanou, Phil (director) |year = 1988 |title = [[Rattle and Hum]] |medium = Motion picture |location = United States |publisher = [[Paramount Pictures]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also featured in the film is footage of Bono spray-painting a monument during an outdoor performance; Bono was forced to pay a fine.

U2's sound and focus dramatically changed with their 1991 album, ''[[Achtung Baby]]''. Bono's lyrics became more personal, inspired by experiences related to the private lives of the members of the band.&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ATU2comBonoBio /&gt; During the band's [[Zoo TV Tour]] several of [[Zoo TV Tour#Bono's stage personas|his stage personas]] were showcased; these included "The Fly", a stereotypical rock star, the "Mirror Ball Man", a parody of American [[televangelists]], and "Mr. MacPhisto", a combination of a corrupted rock star and the [[Satan|Devil]].&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ATU2comBonoBio /&gt;

During performances he attempts to interact with the crowd as often as possible and is known for pulling audience members onto the stage or moving himself down to the physical level of the audience.&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt; This has happened on several occasions including at the [[Live Aid|Live Aid concert]] in 1985 where he leapt off the stage and pulled a woman from the crowd to dance with her as the band played "[[Bad (U2 song)|Bad]]", and in 2005 during U2's [[Vertigo Tour]] stop in Chicago, where he pulled a boy onto the stage during the song "[[An Cat Dubh / Into the Heart]]".&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt;&lt;ref name=VertigoDVD&gt;{{cite video |people = O'Hanlon, Ned (producer), and Hamilton, Hamish (director) |year = 2005 |title = [[Vertigo 2005: Live From Chicago]] |medium = Motion picture |location = United States |publisher = 3DD Entertainment }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bono has often allowed fans to come on stage and perform songs with the band.

Bono has won numerous awards with U2, including 22 [[Grammy award]]s and the [[60th Golden Globe Awards#Best Original Song|2003 Golden Globe award for best original song]], "[[The Hands That Built America]]", for the film ''[[Gangs of New York]]''.&lt;ref name=Grammy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=&amp;winner=u2&amp;year=0&amp;genreID=0&amp;hp=1 |title=Grammy Winners List: Artist&amp;nbsp; U2 |work=[[Grammy Award|Grammy.com]] |publisher=[[The Recording Academy]] |accessdate=19 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mqfKCOyt?url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title= |archivedate=17 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HFPA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.hfpa.org/browse/member/28459 |title=Award Search&amp;nbsp; Bono |publisher=[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]] |accessdate=19 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225607/http://www1.hfpa.org/browse/member/28459 |archivedate=26 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the live broadcast of the Golden Globe ceremony, Bono called the award "really, really fucking brilliant!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boliek |first=Brooks |title=Appeals court throws out FCC indecency ruling |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i9177e066be8bee44d835017eb6e0cda7 |date=5 June 2007 |accessdate=1 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707012358/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i9177e066be8bee44d835017eb6e0cda7 |archivedate=7 July 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the [[Parents Television Council]] condemned Bono for his profanity and started a campaign for its members to file complaints with the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=PTC condemns NBC |publisher=[[Parents Television Council]] |date=20 January 2003 |url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/release/2003/0120.asp |accessdate=16 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930211001/http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/release/2003/0120.asp |archivedate=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bono's use of "fuck" violated FCC indecency standards, the FCC refused to fine NBC because the network did not receive advance notice of the consequences of broadcasting such profanity and the profanity in question was not used in its literal sexual meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Ahrens |first = Frank |title = FCC Says Bono Profanity Violated Standards, but Won't Fine NBC |pages = E1 |work = The Washington Post |date = 19 March 2004 |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A6242-2004Mar18&amp;notFound=true |accessdate = 16 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bono has become one of the world's best-known philanthropic performers and was named the most politically effective celebrity of all time by the ''[[National Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Brownstein, [http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/the-nj-20-the-most-politically-effective-celebrities-of-all-time-20110428], ''The NJ 20'' 29 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Anft, Brennen Jensen, and Ian Wilhelm, [http://philanthropy.com/free/articles/v18/i20/20000601.htm "Voicing Support for Charity"], ''The Chronicle of Philanthropy'' 3 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dean Goodman, "Hollywood Hails U2's Bono for Philanthropy", ''Reuters New Media'' 15 February 2002 {{cite web|url=http://www.aegis.org/news/re/2002/RE020220.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222084411/http://www.aegis.org/news/re/2002/RE020220.html |archivedate=22 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been dubbed, "the face of fusion philanthropy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Tom Zeller, Jr. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/13/us/13bono.html?n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fP%2fPhilanthropy |title=Trying to Throw His Arms Around the World |newspaper=The New York Times |date=13 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; both for his success enlisting powerful allies from a diverse spectrum of leaders in government, religious institutions, philanthropic organisations, popular media, and the business world, as well as for spearheading new organizational networks that bind global humanitarian relief with geopolitical activism and corporate commercial enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1142278,00.html|title=Nancy Gibbs, "The Good Samaritans"|date=19 December 2005|work=Time |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1986 interview with ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, Bono explained that he was motivated to become involved in social and political causes by seeing one of the ''[[The Secret Policeman's Balls|Secret Policeman's Ball]]'' benefit shows, staged by [[John Cleese]] and producer [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]] for the human-rights organisation [[Amnesty International]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=10202006Boyd&gt;Boyd, B.

Since 1999, Bono has become increasingly involved in campaigning for third-world debt relief and raising awareness of the plight of Africa, including the AIDS pandemic. In the past decade Bono has met with several influential politicians, including former United States President [[George W.

(...) This must happen urgently, because this is a crisis."&lt;ref name=GuardianStory /&gt; In May of that year, Bono took US Treasury Secretary [[Paul H. O'Neill]] on a four-country tour of Africa.

TED rejected the third wish as being a sub-optimal way for TED to help Africa&lt;ref name="bonowish"/&gt; and instead organised a TED conference in Arusha, Tanzania. Bono attended the conference, which was held in June 2007.

In 2005 he recorded a version of "[[Don't Give Up (Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush song)|Don't Give Up]]" with [[Alicia Keys]], with proceeds going to [[Keep a Child Alive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/10269863|title= Alicia Keys, Bono to raise funds with AIDS song|agency=Associated Press|date=2 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 April 2005, Bono paid a personal tribute to [[John Paul II]] and called him "a street fighter and a wily campaigner on behalf of the world's poor.

In a speech containing biblical references, Bono encouraged the care of the socially and economically depressed. His comments included a call for an extra one percent [[tithe]] of the United States' national budget. He brought his Christian views into harmony with other faiths by noting that Christian, Jewish, and [[Muslim]] writings all call for the care of the widow, orphan, and stranger. President Bush received praise from the singer-activist for the United States' increase in aid for the African continent. Bono continued by saying much work is left to be done to be a part of God's ongoing purposes.&lt;ref name=NationalPrayerBreakfast&gt;Bono. (February 2006).

On 15 December 2005, [[Paul Theroux]] published an op-ed in ''The New York Times'' called ''The Rock Star's Burden'' (cf. [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling's]] ''[[The White Man's Burden]]'') that criticised stars such as Bono, [[Brad Pitt]], and [[Angelina Jolie]], labelling them as "[[mythomaniac]]s, people who wish to convince the world of their worth." Theroux, who lived in Africa as a [[Peace Corps]] Volunteer, added that "the impression that Africa is fatally troubled and can be saved only by outside helpnot to mention celebrities and charity concertsis a destructive and misleading conceit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/15/opinion/15theroux.html|title=The Rock Star's Burden|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=22 September 2014|first=Paul|last=Theroux|date=15 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, Bono has been criticised, along with other celebrities, for "[ignoring] the legitimate voices of Africa and [turning] a global movement for justice into a grand orgy of [[narcissistic]] philanthropy".&lt;ref name="movement_robbed"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahmad |first=Muhammad Idrees |title=Live 8&amp;nbsp; A movement robbed of its colours |publisher=Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom |date=15 August 2005 |url=http://keywords.dsvr.co.uk/cpbf_newsite/body.php?subject=international&amp;id=1104 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20090427161025/http://keywords.dsvr.co.uk/cpbf_newsite/body.php?subject=international&amp;id=1104 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 April 2009 |accessdate=5 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When trade laws prevent you from selling the food you grew, you are not free ... When you are a monk in Burma this very week, barred from entering a temple because of your gospel of peace ... well, then none of us are truly free''". Bono donated the $100,000 prize to the organisation.

Bono was a special guest editor of the July 2007 issue of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine. The issue was named "The Africa Issue: Politics &amp; Power" and featured an assortment of 20 different covers, with photographs by [[Annie Leibovitz]] of a number of prominent celebrities, political leaders, and philanthropists.

In an article in Bloomberg Markets in March 2007, journalists [[Richard Tomlinson]] and Fergal O'Brien noted that Bono used his band's 2006 Vertigo world tour to promote his [[ONE Campaign]] while at the same time "U2 was racking up $389&amp;nbsp;million in gross ticket receipts, making Vertigo the second-most lucrative tour of all time, according to Billboard magazine ...

Further criticism came in November 2007, when Bono's various charity campaigns were targeted by Jobs Selasie, head of [[African Aid Action]]. Selasie claimed that these charities had increased corruption and dependency in Africa because they failed to work with African entrepreneurs and grassroots organisations, and as a result, Africa has become more dependent on international handouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/bono/32704|title=Bono and Bob Geldof increase Africa's problems say charity|date=23 November 2007|work=NME.COM|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bono responded to his critics in ''Times Online'' on 19 February 2006, calling them "cranks carping from the sidelines. A lot of them wouldn't know what to do if they were on the field.

Bono was among those cited in the [[Paradise Papers]] after he was named as a passive minority investor in Nude Estates, which bought a shopping mall in Lithuania in 2007 and transferred ownership to Nude Estates 1 in Guernsey in an apparent attempt to avoid tax. Bono welcomed the subsequent investigation by the Lithuanian tax authority, stating that he welcomed transparency and had personally campaigned for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Paradise Papers: Bono says he welcomes investigation into offshore investment| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/bono-paradise-papers-u2-tax-offshore-investment-guernsey-malta-shopping-mall-statement-latest-a8044541.html | newspaper = The Independent | date = 8 November 2017 |first = Roisin | last = O'Connor | accessdate = 10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nude Estates paid 53,000 in taxes and fines after the investigation was completed and Bono severed ties with the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =
