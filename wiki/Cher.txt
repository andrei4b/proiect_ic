'''Cher''' ({{IPAc-en||r}}; born May 20, 1946 as '''Cherilyn Sarkisian''', {{lang-hy| }}) is an American singer and actress. Sometimes called the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Goddess of Pop]], she has been described as embodying female autonomy in a male-dominated industry. She is known for her distinctive [[contralto]] singing voice and for having worked in numerous areas of entertainment, as well as adopting a variety of styles and appearances during her six-decade-long career.

Cher gained popularity in 1965 as one-half of the [[folk rock]] husband-wife duo [[Sonny &amp; Cher]] after their song "[[I Got You Babe]]" reached number one on the American and British charts. By the end of 1967, they had sold 40&amp;nbsp;million records worldwide and had become, according to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, rock's "it" couple.&lt;ref name=time1998&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bellafante|first=Ginia|authorlink=Ginia Bellafante|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/01/12/time/Bellafante.html|title=Appreciation: The Sonny Side of Life|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=January 19, 1998|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began her solo career simultaneously, releasing in 1966 her first million-seller song, "[[Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)]]". She became a television personality in the 1970s with her shows ''[[The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour]]'', watched by over 30 million viewers weekly during its three-year run, and ''[[Cher (TV series)|Cher]]''. She emerged as a fashion trendsetter by wearing elaborate outfits on her television shows.

While working on television, Cher established herself as a solo artist with the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart-topping singles "[[Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves]]", "[[Half-Breed (song)|Half-Breed]]", and "[[Dark Lady (song)|Dark Lady]]". After her divorce from [[Sonny Bono]] in 1975, she launched a comeback in 1979 with the [[disco]] album ''[[Take Me Home (Cher album)|Take Me Home]]'' and earned $300,000 a week for her 1980{{ndash}}82 [[Cher in Concert#A Celebration at Caesars Palace|concert residency]] in Las Vegas.

In 1982, Cher made her Broadway debut in the play ''[[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (play)|Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean]]'' and starred in its [[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|film adaptation]]. She subsequently earned critical acclaim for her performances in films such as ''[[Silkwood]]'' (1983), ''[[Mask (film)|Mask]]'' (1985), and ''[[Moonstruck]]'' (1987), for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She then revived her musical career by recording the [[Rock music|rock]]-inflected albums ''[[Cher (1987 album)|Cher]]'' (1987), ''[[Heart of Stone (Cher album)|Heart of Stone]]'' (1989), and ''[[Love Hurts (Cher album)|Love Hurts]]'' (1991), all of which yielded several successful singles.

Cher reached a new commercial peak in 1998 with the album ''[[Believe (Cher album)|Believe]]'', whose [[Believe (Cher song)|title track]] became the biggest-selling single of all time by a female artist in the UK. It features the pioneering use of [[Auto-Tune]], also known as the "Cher effect". Her 20022005 [[Living Proof: The Farewell Tour]] became one of the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing concert tours]] of all time, earning $250 million. In 2008, she signed a $180&amp;nbsp;million deal to headline [[the Colosseum at Caesars Palace]] in Las Vegas for three years. Cher's first studio album in 12 years, ''[[Closer to the Truth (Cher album)|Closer to the Truth]]'' (2013), became her highest-charting solo album in the U.S. when it debuted at number three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. In 2018, Cher will return to film for her first on-screen role since 2010's ''[[Burlesque (2010 American film)|Burlesque]]'', starring in the romantic musical comedy film ''[[Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again]]''. She is also set to embark on the Australia-only [[Here We Go Again Tour]], which is her first tour in the country in 13 years.

Cher has won a [[Grammy Award]], an [[Emmy Award]], an [[Academy Award]], three [[Golden Globe Award]]s, a [[Cannes Film Festival]] Award, and a special [[Council of Fashion Designers of America|CFDA Fashion Award]], among several other honors. She has sold 100 million records worldwide to date, becoming one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] in history. She is the only artist to date to have a number-one single on a ''Billboard'' chart in each decade from the 1960s to the 2010s. Outside of her music and acting, she is noted for her political views, philanthropic endeavors, and social activism, including [[LGBT rights by country or territory|LGBT rights]] and [[HIV/AIDS]] prevention.

== Life and career ==
=== 19461961: Early life ===
[[File:Cher HS Yearbook.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A black and white photograph of a young, dark-haired girl looking at the camera and smiling.|Cher as a high school student in 1960]]
Cher was born Cherilyn Sarkisian in [[El Centro, California]], on May 20, 1946.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=17}} Her father, John Sarkisian, was an [[Armenian-American]] truck driver with drug and gambling problems; her mother, [[Georgia Holt]] (born Jackie Jean Crouch), was an occasional model and bit-part actress who claimed Irish, English, German, and [[Cherokee people|Cherokee]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bego|2001|p=11}}: Sarkisian's profession;&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Berman|2001|p=17}}: Sarkisian's nationality and personal problems, Crouch's profession;&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheever|first=Susan|authorlink=Susan Cheever|url=http://people.com/archive/in-a-broken-land-vol-39-no-19/|title=In a Broken Land|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=May 17, 1993|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}: Sarkisian's nationality, Crouch's ancestry.&lt;/ref&gt; Cher's father was rarely home when she was an infant,{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=147}} and her parents divorced when Cher was ten months old.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=17}} Her mother later married actor John Southall, by whom she had another daughter, Georganne, Cher's half-sister.{{sfn|Berman|2001|pp=1718}}

Now living in Los Angeles, Cher's mother began acting while working as a waitress. She changed her name to Georgia Holt and played minor roles in films and on television. Holt also secured acting parts for her daughters as [[Extra (actor)|extras]] on television shows like ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]''.{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=147}} Her mother's relationship with Southall ended when Cher was nine years old, but she considers him her father and remembers him as a "good-natured man who turned belligerent when he drank too much".{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=18}} Holt remarried and divorced several more times, and she moved her family around the country (including New York, Texas, and California).{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=147}} They often had little money, and Cher recounted having had to use rubber bands to hold her shoes together.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=18}} At one point, her mother left Cher at an orphanage for several weeks.{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=10}} Although they met every day, both found the experience traumatic.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=18}}

When Cher was in fifth grade, she produced a performance of the musical ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' for her teacher and class. She organized a group of girls, directing and choreographing their dance routines. Unable to convince boys to participate, she acted the male roles and sang their songs. By age nine, she had developed an unusually low voice.{{sfn|Cher|Coplon|1998|p=39}} Fascinated by film stars, Cher's role model was [[Audrey Hepburn]], particularly due to her role in the 1961 film ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]''. Cher began to take after the unconventional outfits and behavior of Hepburn's character.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=22}} She was disappointed by the absence of dark-haired Hollywood actresses whom she could emulate.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=22}} She had wanted to be famous since childhood but felt unattractive and untalented, later commenting, "I couldn't think of anything that I could do&amp;nbsp;... I didn't think I'd be a singer or dancer. I just thought, well, I'll be famous. That was my goal."{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=21}}

In 1961, Holt married bank manager Gilbert LaPiere, who adopted Cher (under the name Cheryl LaPiere)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/cheryl_lapiere_born_1946_3214561|title=Cheryl Lapiere, Born 05/20/1946 in California|publisher=[[California Birth Index]]|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Georganne, and enrolled them at [[Montclair College Preparatory School]], a private school in [[Encino, Los Angeles|Encino]], whose students were mostly from affluent families. The school's upper-class environment presented a challenge for Cher; biographer Connie Berman wrote, "[she] stood out from the others in both her striking appearance and outgoing personality."{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=21}} A former classmate commented, "I'll never forget seeing Cher for the first time. She was so special&amp;nbsp;... She was like a movie star, right then and there&amp;nbsp;... She said she was going to be a movie star and we knew she would."{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=21}} Despite not being an excellent student, Cher was intelligent and creative, according to Berman. She earned high grades, excelling in French and English classes. As an adult, she discovered that she had [[dyslexia]]. Cher achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior: she performed songs for students during the lunch hours and surprised peers when she wore a midriff-baring top.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=22}} She later recalled, "I was never really in school. I was always thinking about when I was grown up and famous."{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=147}}

=== 19621965: Solo career breakthrough ===
At age 16, Cher dropped out of school, left her mother's house, and moved to Los Angeles with a friend. She took acting classes and worked to support herself, dancing in small [[nightclub|clubs]] along Hollywood's [[Sunset Strip]] and introducing herself to performers, managers, and agents.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=23}} According to Berman, "[Cher] did not hesitate to approach anyone she thought could help her get a break, make a new contact, or get an audition."{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=24}} Cher met performer [[Sonny Bono]] in November 1962 when he was working for record producer [[Phil Spector]].{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=24}} Cher's friend moved out, and Cher accepted Sonny's offer to be his [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]].{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=27}} Sonny introduced Cher to Spector, who used her as a [[Backing vocalist|backup singer]] on many recordings, including [[the Ronettes]]' "[[Be My Baby]]" and [[the Righteous Brothers]]' "[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]".{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=28}} Spector produced her first single, the commercially unsuccessful "[[Ringo, I Love You]]", which Cher recorded under the name Bonnie Jo Mason.&lt;ref name=Eder2009&gt;{{cite web|last=Eder|first=Bruce|title=Cher&amp;nbsp; Biography &amp; History|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cher-mn0000107090/biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cher and Sonny became close friends, eventual lovers, and performed their own unofficial wedding ceremony in a hotel room in Tijuana, Mexico, on October 27, 1964.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=28}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2512&amp;dat=19750628&amp;id=dRNIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hgANAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3860,3724402&amp;hl=en|title=Cher divorces Sonny|newspaper=[[Record-Journal]]|date=June 28, 1975|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Sonny had wanted to launch Cher as a solo artist, she encouraged him to perform with her because she suffered from [[stage fright]], and he began joining her onstage, singing the harmonies. Cher disguised her nervousness by looking at Sonny; she later commented that she sang to the people through him.{{sfn|Cher|Coplon|1998|p=94}} In late 1964, they emerged as a duo called Caesar &amp; Cleo, releasing the poorly received singles "[[Do You Wanna Dance?#Other versions|Do You Wanna Dance?]]", "[[Love Is Strange]]", and "[[Let the Good Times Roll (Shirley and Lee song)|Let the Good Times Roll]]".{{sfn|Bego|2001|pp=2930}}

Cher signed with [[Liberty Records]]' [[Imperial Records|Imperial]] imprint in the end of 1964, and Sonny became her producer. The single "Dream Baby", released under the name "Cherilyn", received airplay in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=Eder2009 /&gt; Encouraged by Imperial, Cher worked with Sonny on her second solo single on the label, a cover version of [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[All I Really Want to Do]]",&lt;ref name=Eder2009 /&gt; which peaked at number 15 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=BiggestBBHits&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/1563030/cher-birthday-billboard-hits|title=Cher's 20 Biggest Billboard Hits|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=May 20, 2014|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[the Byrds]] had released their own version of the same song. When competition on the singles charts started between Cher and the Byrds, the group's record label began to promote the [[I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better|B-side]] of the Byrds' single. [[Roger McGuinn]] of the Byrds commented, "We loved the Cher version&amp;nbsp;... We didn't want to hassle. So we just turned our record over."{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=40}} Cher's debut album, ''[[All I Really Want to Do (album)|All I Really Want to Do]]'' (1965), reached number 16 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cher&amp;nbsp; Awards|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cher-mn0000107090/biography|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was later described by [[AllMusic]]'s Tim Sendra as "one of the stronger folk-pop records of the era".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sendra|first=Tim|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/all-i-really-want-to-do-mw0000457386|title=All I Really Want to Do  Cher&amp;nbsp; Songs, Reviews, redits|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1965, Caesar and Cleo began calling themselves [[Sonny &amp; Cher]].{{sfn|Cher|Coplon|1998|p=98}} Following the recording of "[[I Got You Babe]]", they traveled to England in July 1965 at [[the Rolling Stones]]' advice; Cher recalled, "[they] had told us&amp;nbsp;... that Americans just didn't get us and that if we were going to make it big, we were going to have to go to England."{{sfn|Cher|Coplon|1998|pp=108109}} According to writer [[Cintra Wilson]], "English newspaper photographers showed up when S&amp;C were thrown out of the London Hilton [because of their outfits] the night they arrivedliterally overnight, they were stars.

By the end of the 1960s, Sonny and Cher's music had ceased to chart. According to Berman, "the heavy, loud sound of groups like [[Jefferson Airplane]] and [[Cream (band)|Cream]] made the folk-rock music of Sonny and Cher seem too bland."{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=31}} Cher later commented, "I loved the new sound of [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Eric Clapton]], the electric-guitar oriented bands.

Cher's next album, ''[[Backstage (album)|Backstage]]'' (1968), in which she runs in diverse musical directions, including [[Bossa nova|Brazilian jazz]] and anti-war protest settings, was not a commercial success.{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=54}} In 1969, she was dropped from Imperial Records.

That year, the duo spent $500,000 and mortgaged their home to make the film ''[[Chastity (film)|Chastity]]''.

They seemed like a perfect family."{{sfn|Berman|2001|pp=3334}} Cher honed her acting skills in [[sketch comedy]] roles such as the brash housewife Laverne, the sardonic waitress Rosa, and historical vamps,&lt;ref name=AllMovieBio&gt;{{cite web|last=Erickson|first=Hal|authorlink=Hal Erickson (author)|title=Cher&amp;nbsp; Biography, Movie Highlights and Photos|url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/cher-p12664|publisher=[[AllMovie]]|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Cleopatra]] and [[Miss Sadie Thompson]].{{sfn|Mansour|2005|p=450}} The [[Bob Mackie]] designed clothing Cher wore was part of the show's attraction, and her style influenced the [[1970s in fashion|fashion trends of the 1970s]].{{sfn|Bego|2001|pp=7678}}

In 1971, Sonny and Cher signed with the [[Kapp Records]] division of [[MCA Records]], and Cher released the single "Classified 1A", in which she sings from the point of view of a soldier who bleeds to death in Vietnam. Written by Sonny, who felt that her first solo single on the label had to be poignant and topical, the song was rejected by radio station programmers as uncommercial.{{sfn|Bego|2001|pp=6872}}

Since Sonny's first attempts at reviving their recording career as a duo had also been unsuccessful, Kapp Records recruited [[Snuff Garrett]] to work with them. He produced Cher's first U.S. solo number-one single, "[[Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves]]", which "proved that&amp;nbsp;...

In 1972, Cher released the all-ballad set ''[[Foxy Lady (Cher album)|Foxy Lady]]'', demonstrating the evolution of her vocal abilities, according to Bego.{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=81}} Following the release of the album, Garrett quit as producer after disagreeing with Sonny about the kind of material Cher should record.{{sfn|Bronson|1997|p=345}} At Sonny's insistence, in 1973 Cher released an album of [[Standard (music)|standards]] called ''[[Bittersweet White Light]]'', which was commercially unsuccessful.{{sfn|Bego|2001|pp=8182}} That year, lyricist Mary Dean brought Garrett "[[Half-Breed (song)|Half-Breed]]", a song about the daughter of a Cherokee mother and a white father, that she had written especially for Cher. Although Garrett did not have Cher as a client at the time, he was convinced that "it's a smash for Cher and for nobody else", so he held the song for months until he got Cher back.{{sfn|Bronson|1997|p=345}} "Half-Breed" was featured on the [[Half-Breed (album)|album of the same name]] and became Cher's second U.S. solo number-one single.{{sfn|Bronson|1997|p=359}} Both the album and the single were certified gold by the RIAA.&lt;ref name=RIAA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/|title=Gold &amp; Platinum|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cher's third U.S. solo number-one single was "[[Dark Lady (song)|Dark Lady]]", in 1974, from the [[Dark Lady (album)|namesake album]].{{sfn|Bronson|1997|p=359}} Later that year, she released a ''[[Greatest Hits (Cher album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album that, according to ''Billboard'' magazine, proved her to be "one of the most consistent hitmakers of the past five years", as well as a "proven superstar who always sells records".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Top Album Picks|magazine=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lAkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA54|accessdate=January 16, 2016|date=November 17, 1974|first=Bob|last=Kirsch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Cher's efforts to develop her musical range by listening to artists such as [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Elton John]], [[James Taylor]], [[Carly Simon]], [[Joni Mitchell]], and [[Bob Dylan]], the resulting album ''[[Stars (Cher album)|Stars]]'' was commercially and critically unsuccessful.{{sfn|Bego|2001|pp=9798}} [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' wrote, "Cher is just no rock and roller&amp;nbsp;...

A single mother with two children, Cher realized that she had to make a choice about the direction of her singing career. Deciding to temporarily abandon her desire to be a rock singer, she signed with [[Casablanca Records]] and launched a comeback with the single "[[Take Me Home (Cher song)|Take Me Home]]" and the [[Take Me Home (Cher album)|album of the same name]], both of which capitalized on the [[disco]] craze.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=44}} Both the album and the single became instant successes, remained bestsellers for more than half of 1979,{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=44}} and were certified gold by the RIAA.&lt;ref name=RIAA /&gt; Sales of the album may have been boosted{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=44}} by the image of a scantily clad Cher in a [[Viking]] outfit on its cover.{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=124}} Despite her initial lack of enthusiasm for disco music, she changed her mind after the success, commenting, "I never thought I would want to do disco&amp;nbsp;... [but] it's terrific! It's great music to dance to. I think that danceable music is what everybody wants."{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=44}}

Encouraged by the popularity of ''Take Me Home'', Cher planned to return to rock music in her next album, ''[[Prisoner (Cher album)|Prisoner]]'' (1979).{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=45}} The album's cover features Cher draped in chains as a "prisoner of the press",{{sfn|Berman|2001|pp=4546}} which caused controversy among feminist groups for her perceived portrayal of a sex slave.{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=272}} She included rock songs, which made the disco release seem unfocused and led to its commercial failure.{{sfn|Berman|2001|pp=4546}} ''Prisoner'' produced the single "[[Hell on Wheels (song)|Hell on Wheels]]", featured on the soundtrack of the film ''[[Roller Boogie]]''. The song exploits the late 1970s [[Roller skating|roller-skating]] fad and contributed to its popularity.&lt;ref name=CherInterview1999 /&gt;

In 1980, alongside Italian record producer [[Giorgio Moroder]], Cher wrote her last Casablanca disco recording, "Bad Love", for the film ''[[Foxes (film)|Foxes]]''.{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=139}} She formed the rock band Black Rose that year with her then-lover, guitarist [[Les Dudek]]. Although Cher was the lead singer, she did not receive top billing because she wanted to create the impression that all band members were equal. Since she was easily recognized when she performed with the band, she developed a [[Punk fashion|punk look]] by cutting her trademark long hair. Despite appearances on television, the band failed to earn concert dates.{{sfn|Berman|2001|pp=4647}} Their album ''[[Black Rose (Cher album)|Black Rose]]'' received unfavorable reviews; Cher told ''Rolling Stone'', "The critics panned us, and they didn't attack the record. They attacked me. It was like, 'How dare Cher sing rock &amp; roll?'"&lt;ref name=Johnson2002 /&gt; During the band's active period, Cher was simultaneously doing a [[Cher in Concert#A Celebration at Caesars Palace|concert residency]] in Las Vegas, earning $300,000 a week.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=47}} Its companion television special ''Cher&amp;nbsp;... A Celebration at Caesars'' aired on [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] in April 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=People|title=Picks and Pans Review: Cher&amp;nbsp;... a Celebration at Caesars|date=April 4, 1983|url=http://people.com/archive/picks-and-pans-review-cher-a-celebration-at-caesars-vol-19-no-13/|accessdate=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black Rose disbanded in 1981.{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=143}} That year, she released a duet with musician [[Meat Loaf]] called "[[Dead Ringer for Love]]", which reached number five on the UK Singles Chart and was later described by AllMusic's Donald A. Guarisco as "one of the more inspired rock duets of the 1980s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Guarisco|first=Donald A.|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/dead-ringer-for-love-mt0004520252|title=Dead Ringer for Love  Meat Loaf&amp;nbsp; Song Info|accessdate=January 17, 2016|publisher=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, [[Columbia Records]] released the album ''[[I Paralyze]]'', later deemed by Bego as Cher's "strongest and most consistent solo album in years" despite its low sales.{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=159}}

=== 19821987: Film career breakthrough, musical hiatus ===
With decreasing album sales and a lack of commercially successful singles, Cher decided to further develop her acting career.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=49}} While she had previously aspired to venture into film, she had only the critically and commercially unsuccessful movies ''Good Times'' and ''Chastity'' to her credit, and the Hollywood establishment did not take her seriously as an actress.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=49}} She moved to New York in 1982 to take acting lessons with [[Lee Strasberg]], founder of the [[Actors Studio]], but never enrolled after her plans changed.&lt;ref name=CintraWilson /&gt; She auditioned for and was signed by director [[Robert Altman]] for the Broadway stage production ''[[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (play)|Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean]]'', playing a member of a [[James Dean]] fan club holding a 20-year reunion. That year, Altman cast her again in the [[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|film adaptation]] of the same title.{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=151}} Cher credits Altman for launching her acting career: "Without Bob [Robert Altman] I would have never had a film career. Everyone told him not to cast me&amp;nbsp;... I am convinced that Bob was the only one who was brave enough to do it."{{sfn|Zuckoff|2009|p=431}}

Director [[Mike Nichols]], who had seen Cher onstage in ''Jimmy Dean'', offered her the part of [[Dusty Ellis|Dolly Pelliker]], a plant co-worker and [[Meryl Streep]]'s lesbian roommate in the film ''[[Silkwood]]''.{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=151}} When it premiered in 1983, audiences questioned Cher's ability as an actress. She recalls attending a film preview during which the audience laughed when they saw her name in the credits.{{sfn|Berman|2001|p=54}} For her performance, Cher won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress  Motion Picture]].{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=151}}

In 1985, Cher formed the film production company Isis.&lt;ref name=vanityfair90&gt;{{cite journal|first=Kevin|last=Sessums|authorlink=Kevin Sessums|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/1990/11/cher-199011|title=Cher: Starred and Feathered|magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=October 31, 1990|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her next film, ''[[Mask (film)|Mask]]'' (1985), reached number two at the box office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&amp;id=mask85.htm|title=Mask (1985)&amp;nbsp; Weekend Box Office Results|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was Cher's first critical and commercial success as a leading actress.{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=151}} For her role as a drug addict biker with a teenage son who has a severe physical deformity, she won the [[Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress]].{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=151}} During the making of the film, however, she clashed with director [[Peter Bogdanovich]]. She attended the [[58th Academy Awards]] in a tarantula-like costume "to show her scorn for the 'system'", according to authors James Parish and Michael Pitts.{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=151}} The incident garnered her much publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8557447.stm|title=Talking Shop: Designer Bob Mackie|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=March 18, 2010|accessdate=January 17, 2016|last=Hassan|first=Genevieve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1987, Cher was receiving attention for her controversial lifestyle, including her tattoos, plastic surgeries, exhibitionist fashion sense, and affairs with younger men.{{sfn|Mansour|2005|p=82}} She had romantic relationships with actors [[Val Kilmer]], [[Eric Stoltz]], and [[Tom Cruise]], hockey player [[Ron Duguay]], film producer Josh Donen, [[Bon Jovi]] guitarist [[Richie Sambora]], and Rob Camilletti, an 18-years-younger bagel baker whom she dated from 1986 to 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Cher's romantic relationships during the 1980s:

=== 19871992: Film stardom, third musical comeback ===
Cher starred in three films in 1987.{{sfn|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=151}} In ''[[Suspect (1987 film)|Suspect]]'', she played a public defender who is both helped and romanced by one of the jurors in the homicide case she is handling.

In 1987, Cher signed with [[Geffen Records]] and revived her musical career with what music critics Johnny Danza and Dean Ferguson describe as "her most impressive string of hits to date", establishing her as a "serious rock and roller&amp;nbsp;... a crown that she'd worked long and hard to capture".&lt;ref name=CherInterview1999 /&gt; [[Michael Bolton]], [[Jon Bon Jovi]], [[Desmond Child]], and Richie Sambora produced her first Geffen album,&lt;ref name=CherInterview1999 /&gt; ''[[Cher (1987 album)|Cher]]'', which was certified platinum by the RIAA.&lt;ref name=RIAA /&gt; It features the rock ballad "[[I Found Someone]]", her first U.S. top-ten single in more than eight years.&lt;ref name=CherInterview1999 /&gt;

=== 19921997: Health and professional struggles, directing debut ===

''[[Not.com.mercial]]'' (2000) was written mostly by Cher after she had attended a songwriters' conference in 1994; it marked her first attempt at writing most of the tracks for an album. As the album was rejected by her record label for being uncommercial, she chose to sell it only on her website. In the song "Sisters of Mercy", she criticized as "cruel, heartless and wicked" the nuns who prevented her mother from retrieving her from a Catholic orphanage. The Catholic church denounced the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Deborah|last=Wilker|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-11-14/features/0011130180_1_cher-songwriting-record|title=I've Got E, Babe|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=November 14, 2000|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in 2013, Cher reflected on how her voice had evolved during the course of her career, eventually getting stronger and suppler over the years. While she didn't really like it at the beginning, working with vocal coaches had made a significant difference; she stated in the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'': "It's so freaky because people my age are having to lose notes and I'm gaining notes, so that's pretty shocking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Rechtshaffen|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2013/09/13/cher-finds-truth-in-new-album|title=Cher finds 'Truth' in new album |work=[[Toronto Sun]]|accessdate=July 29, 2017|date=September 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Yvonne Tasker, in her book ''Working Girls: Gender and Sexuality in Popular Cinema'' (2002), notes that Cher's film roles often mirrors her public image as a rebellious, sexually autonomous, and [[Self-made man|self-made]] woman.{{sfn|Tasker|2002|pp=191192}} In her films, she recurrently serves as a social intermediary to disenfranchised male characters, such as [[Eric Stoltz]]'s [[Craniodiaphyseal dysplasia]] victim in ''Mask'' (1985), [[Liam Neeson]]'s mute homeless veteran in ''Suspect'' (1987), and [[Nicolas Cage]]'s socially isolated baker with a wooden hand in ''Moonstruck'' (1987).{{sfn|Negra|2001|pp=170171}} Film critic Kathleen Rowe wrote of ''Moonstruck'' that the depiction of Cher's character as "a 'woman on top' [is] enhanced by the unruly star persona Cher brings to the part'.{{sfn|Tasker|2002|p=192}} Jeff Yarbrough of ''[[The Advocate]]'' wrote that Cher was "one of the first superstars to 'play gay' with compassion and without a hint of stereotyping", as she portrays a lesbian in the 1983 film ''Silkwood''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T2MEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;pg=PA6|magazine=The Advocate|title=Hollywood lives|first=Jeff|last=Yarbrough|date=August 20, 1996|accessdate=January 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cher has attracted media attention for her physical appearanceparticularly her youthful looks and her tattoos.

Cher has engaged in a transformational technology that is dramatic and irreversible."&lt;ref name=McCracken /&gt; Caroline Ramazanoglu, author of ''Up Against Foucault: Explorations of Some Tensions Between Foucault and Feminism'' (1993), wrote that "Cher's operations have gradually replaced a strong, decidedly 'ethnic' look with a more symmetrical, delicate, 'conventional'&amp;nbsp;... and ever-youthful version of female beauty&amp;nbsp;...

In an interview with ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', she was critical of a variety of political topics, including Republican politicians like [[Sarah Palin]] and [[Jan Brewer]].&lt;ref name=VF2010 /&gt; She has commented that she did not understand why anyone would be a Republican because eight years under the administration of [[George W.

On October 27, 2003, Cher anonymously called a [[C-SPAN]] phone-in program to recount a visit she made to maimed soldiers at the [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] and criticized the lack of media coverage and government attention given to injured servicemen. She remarked that she watches C-SPAN every day. Although she identified herself as an unnamed entertainer, she was recognized by the C-SPAN host, who subsequently questioned her about her 1992 support for independent presidential candidate [[Ross Perot]]. She said, "When I heard him talk right in the beginning, I thought that he would bring some sort of common-sense business approach and also less partisanship, but then&amp;nbsp;... I was completely disappointed like everyone else when he just kind of cut and run and no one knew exactly why&amp;nbsp;...

Cher has repeatedly reinvented herself through various personas,{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=7}} for which Professor Richard Aquila from [[Ball State University]] called her "the ultimate pop chameleon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Marc |last=Ransford |url=http://www.bsu.edu/news/article/0,1370,-1019-11364,00.html |title=Professor: Cher is the ultimate pop chameleon |publisher=[[Ball State University]] |date=May 27, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605011648/http://www.bsu.edu/news/article/0%2C1370%2C-1019-11364%2C00.html |archivedate=June 5, 2010 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' declared Cher as the "Queen of the Comeback".&lt;ref name=QueenComeback /&gt; According to author [[Lucy O'Brien]], "Cher adheres to the American Dream of reinvention of self: 'Getting old does not have to mean getting obsolete.'"{{sfn|Carson|Lewis|Shaw|2004|p=130}}

Author [[Craig Crawford]], in his book ''The Politics of Life: 25 Rules for Survival in a Brutal and Manipulative World'' (2007), describes Cher as "a model of flexible career management", and relates her career successes to a constant reshaping of her image according to the evolving trends of popular culture.{{sfn|Crawford|2007|pp=3132}} He further explains that she billed "each dramatic turnaround of style as another example of rebellionan image that allowed her to make calculated changes while appearing to be consistent."{{sfn|Crawford|2007|pp=3132}} Author Grant McCracken stated, "The term 'reinvention' is now often used to talk about the careers of American celebrities. But in Cher's case, it is particularly apt [because she] is inclined to lock on to each new fashion wave [and] is swept violently down the diffusion stream and out of fashion. Only substantial re-creation permits her to return to stardom."&lt;ref name=McCracken /&gt; Her "integrity" and "perseverance" are highlighted in the ''Reaching Your Goals'' book series of illustrated inspirational stories for children, in which her life is detailed emphasizing the importance of [[self-actualization]]: "For years, Cher worked hard to become a successful singer. Then she worked hard to become an actress. Even when she needed money, she turned down movie roles that weren't right for her. Her goal has always been to be a good actress, not just a rich and famous one."{{sfn|Negra|2001|pp=170171}}

Cher's "ability to forge an immensely successful and lengthy career as a woman in a male-dominated entertainment world"&lt;ref name=buffalo /&gt; has drawn attention from feminist critics.{{sfn|Negra|2001|p=164}} According to author Diane Negra, Cher was presented in the beginning of her career as a product of male creativity;{{sfn|Negra|2001|p=170}} Cher remembers, "It was a time when girl singers were patted on the head for being good and told not to think".&lt;ref name=QueenComeback /&gt; However, her image eventually changed due to her "refusal of dependence on a man and the determination not only to forge a career (as an actor) on her own terms but to refuse the conventional role assigned to women over forty years old in an industry that fetishises youth", wrote author Yvonne Tasker.{{sfn|Tasker|2002|p=191}} She was featured in the 16th-anniversary edition of ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' magazine as an "authentic feminist hero" and a 1980s role model for women: "Cher, the straightforward, tattooed, dyslexic single mother, the first Oscar winner to have entered into matrimony with a known heroin addict and to have admitted to being a fashion victim by choice, has finally landed in an era that's not afraid to applaud real women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1988-07-20/lifestyle/0050360144_1_cher-extraordinaire-real-women|title=Cher As 'Feminist Extraordinaire' Is A Ms.-erable Choice|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=July 20, 1988|accessdate=January 18, 2016|last=Parker|first=Kathleen|authorlink=Kathleen Parker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephanie Brush from ''The New York Times'' wrote, following the telecast of Cher's Oscar win in 1988, that she "performs the function for women moviegoers that [[Jack Nicholson]] has always fulfilled for men. Free of the burden of ever having been America's sweetheart, she is the one who represents us [women] in our revenge fantasies, telling all the fatheads&amp;nbsp;... exactly where they can go. You need to be more than beautiful to get away with this. You need to have been Cher for 40 years."&lt;ref name=Brush1988 /&gt;

[[Alec Mapa]] of ''The Advocate'' elaborates: "While the rest of us were sleeping, Cher's been out there for the last four decades living out every single one of our childhood fantasies&amp;nbsp;... Cher embodies an unapologetic freedom and fearlessness that some of us can only aspire to."&lt;ref name=alecmapa/&gt; ''Rolling Stone''{{'s}} [[Jancee Dunn]] wrote, "Cher is the coolest woman who ever stood in shoes. Why? Because her motto is, 'I don't give a shit what you think, I'm going to wear this multicolored wig.' There are folks all over America who would, in their heart of hearts, love to date people half their age, get multiple tattoos and wear feathered headdresses. Cher does it for us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=Rolling Stone|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/cher-19960919|title=Cher|date=September 19, 1996|accessdate=January 18, 2016|first=Jancee|last=Dunn|authorlink=Jancee Dunn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Fury of ''The Independent'' wrote that Cher "represents a seemingly immortal, omnipotent, uni-monikered level of fame."&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt; Bego stated: "No one in the history of show business has had a career of the magnitude and scope of Cher's. She has been a teenage pop star, a television hostess, a fashion magazine model, a rock star, a pop singer, a Broadway actress, an Academy Award-winning movie star, a disco sensation, and the subject of a mountain of press coverage."{{sfn|Bego|2001|p=3}}
