'''John Ronald Reuel Tolkien''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|CBE|FRSL}} ({{IPAc-en||t||l|k|i|n}};&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Tolkien pronounced his surname {{IPAc-en||t||l|k|i|n}}, see his phonetic transcription published on the illustration in ''The Return of the Shadow: The History of The Lord of the Rings, Part One.'' [Edited by] Christopher Tolkien. London: Unwin Hyman, [25 August] 1988. (The History of Middle-earth; 6) {{ISBN|0-04-440162-0}}. In [[General American]] the surname is also pronounced {{IPAc-en||t|o|l|k|i|n}}. This pronunciation no doubt arose by analogy with such words as ''toll'' and ''polka'', or because speakers of General American realise {{IPA|//}} as {{IPA|[]}}, while often hearing British {{IPA|//}} as {{IPA|[]}}; thus {{IPA|[]}} or General American {{IPA|[o]}} become the closest possible approximation to the [[Received Pronunciation]] for many American speakers. Wells, John. 1990. Longman pronunciation dictionary.  Harlow: Longman, {{ISBN|0-582-05383-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3 January 1892  2 September 1973) was an English writer, poet, [[philology|philologist]], and university professor who is best known as the author of the classic [[high fantasy]] works ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.

He served as the [[Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon]] and Fellow of [[Pembroke College, Oxford]], from 1925 to 1945 and [[Merton Professors|Merton Professor of English Language and Literature]] and Fellow of [[Merton College, Oxford]], from 1945 to 1959.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', pp.&amp;nbsp;111, 200, 266.&lt;/ref&gt; He was at one time a close friend of [[C.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Lewis]]they were both members of the informal literary discussion group known as the [[Inklings]]. Tolkien was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] on 28 March 1972.

After Tolkien's death, his son [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]] published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including ''The Silmarillion''. These, together with ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]] and [[Middle-earth]]&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;"Middle-earth" is derived via Middle English ''{{lang|enm|middel-erthe, middel-erd}}'' from ''{{lang|ang|middangeard}}'', an Anglo-Saxon cognate of Old Norse {{lang|non|[[Midgard|Migarr]]}}, the land inhabited by humans in [[Norse mythology]].&lt;/ref&gt; within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term ''[[Tolkien's legendarium|legendarium]]'' to the larger part of these writings.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', nos. 131, 153, 154, 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien,&lt;ref name="de Camp"&gt;{{cite book |last=de Camp |first=L. Sprague |authorlink=L. Sprague de Camp |title=[[Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers|Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy]] |year=1976 |publisher=[[Arkham House]] |isbn=0-87054-076-9 }} The author emphasizes the impact not only of Tolkien but also of [[William Morris]], [[George MacDonald]], [[Robert E. Howard]], and [[Eric Rcker Eddison|E. R. Eddison]].&lt;/ref&gt; the great success of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' led directly to [[works inspired by J. R. R.

==Biography==

===Family origins===
Tolkien's paternal ancestors were middle-class craftsmen who made and sold clocks, watches and pianos in London and Birmingham. The Tolkien family had emigrated from Germany in the 18th century but had become "quickly intensely English".&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the family tradition, the Tolkiens had arrived in England in 1756, as refugees from [[Frederick the Great]]'s invasion of the [[Electorate of Saxony]] during the [[Seven Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', pages 1819.&lt;/ref&gt; Several families with the surname Tolkien or similar spelling live in northwestern Germany, mainly in Lower Saxony and Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verwandt.de/karten/absolut/tolkien.html |title=Absolute Verteilung des Namens 'Tolkien' |language=German |work=verwandt.de |publisher=MyHeritage UK Ltd. |accessdate=9 January 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510202325/http://www.verwandt.de/karten/absolut/tolkien.html |archivedate=10 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verwandt.de/karten/absolut/tolkiehn.html |title=Absolute Verteilung des Namens 'Tolkiehn' |language=German |work=verwandt.de |publisher=My Heritage UK Ltd. |accessdate=9 January 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510194451/http://www.verwandt.de/karten/absolut/tolkiehn.html |archivedate=10 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkien believed his surname derived from the German word ''tollkhn'', meaning "foolhardy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45548112.html |title=Ash nazg gimbatul |language=German |magazine=[[Der Spiegel]] |issue=35/1969 |date=25 August 1969 |quote=Professor Tolkien, der seinen Namen vom deutschen Wort 'tollkhn' ableitet,... . |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427035821/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45548112.html |archivedate=27 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and jokingly inserted himself as a "cameo" into ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'' under the literally translated name Rashbold. However, this origin of the name has not been proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=J. R. R. Tolkien |first=Fabian |last=Geier |language=German |page=9 |year=2009 |publisher=[[Rowohlt Verlag|Rowohlt Taschenbuch Verlag]] |isbn=978-3-49950-664-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood===
[[File:Mabel Suffield Christmas Card.jpg|thumb|right|1892 Christmas card with a coloured photo of the Tolkien family in Bloemfontein, sent to relatives in Birmingham, England]]

John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on 3 January 1892 in [[Bloemfontein]] in the [[Orange Free State]] (now [[Free State Province]] in South Africa) to [[Arthur Tolkien|Arthur Reuel Tolkien]] (18571896), an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, ''ne'' Suffield (18701904). The couple had left England when Arthur was promoted to head the Bloemfontein office of the British bank for which he worked. Tolkien had one sibling, his younger brother, [[Tolkien family#Hilary Tolkien|Hilary Arthur Reuel Tolkien]], who was born on 17 February 1894.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Tolkien was bitten by a large [[Harpactirinae|baboon spider]] in the garden, an event some think later echoed in his stories, although he admitted no actual memory of the event and no special hatred of spiders as an adult. In another incident, a young family servant, who thought Tolkien a beautiful child, took the baby to his [[kraal]] to show him off, returning him the next morning.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;13. Both the spider incident and the visit to a kraal are covered here.&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was three, he went to England with his mother and brother on what was intended to be a lengthy family visit. His father, however, died in South Africa of [[rheumatic fever]] before he could join them.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;24.&lt;/ref&gt; This left the family without an income, so Tolkien's mother took him to live with her parents in [[Kings Heath]],&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', Ch I, "Bloemfontein". At 9 Ashfield Road, King's Heath.&lt;/ref&gt; Birmingham. Soon after, in 1896, they moved to [[Sarehole]] (now in [[Hall Green]]), then a [[Worcestershire]] village, later annexed to Birmingham.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;27.&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed exploring [[Sarehole Mill]] and [[Moseley Bog]] and the [[Clent Hills|Clent]], [[Lickey Hills|Lickey]] and [[Malvern Hills]], which would later inspire scenes in his books, along with nearby towns and villages such as [[Bromsgrove]], [[Alcester]], and [[Alvechurch]] and places such as his aunt Jane's farm of Bag End, the name of which he used in his fiction.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;113.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BirminghamOratoryDome.jpg|thumb|right|[[Birmingham Oratory]], where Tolkien was a parishioner and altar boy (19021911)]]
Mabel Tolkien taught her two children at home. Ronald, as he was known in the family, was a keen pupil.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;/ref&gt; She taught him a great deal of [[botany]] and awakened in him the enjoyment of the look and feel of plants. Young Tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees, but his favourite lessons were those concerning languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of [[Latin]] very early.&lt;ref name=DoughanBio&gt;{{cite web|last=Doughan |first=David |year=2002 |url=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/tolkien/biography.html |title=JRR Tolkien Biography |work=Life of Tolkien |accessdate=12 March 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303050751/http://www.tolkiensociety.org/tolkien/biography.html |archivedate=3 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkien could read by the age of four and could write fluently soon afterwards. His mother allowed him to read many books. He disliked ''[[Treasure Island]]'' and ''[[The Pied Piper]]'' and thought ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]] was "amusing but disturbing". He liked stories about [[Native Americans in the United States|"Red Indians"]] (Native Americans) and the fantasy works by [[George MacDonald]].&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;22.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the "Fairy Books" of [[Andrew Lang]] were particularly important to him and their influence is apparent in some of his later writings.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;30.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:KES Free Grammar School Charles Barry.jpg|thumb|right|King Edward's School in Birmingham, where Tolkien was a student (19001902, 19031911)&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', pp.&amp;nbsp;2451.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Mabel Tolkien was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1900 despite vehement protests by her Baptist family,&lt;ref name=Biography31&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt; which stopped all financial assistance to her. In 1904, when J.R.R. Tolkien was 12, his mother died of [[diabetic ketoacidosis|acute diabetes]] at Fern Cottage in [[Rednal]], which she was renting. She was then about 34 years of age, about as old as a person with [[diabetes mellitus type 1]] could live without treatment[[insulin]] would not be discovered until two decades later. Nine years after her death, Tolkien wrote, "My own dear mother was a martyr indeed, and it is not to everybody that God grants so easy a way to his great gifts as he did to Hilary and myself, giving us a mother who killed herself with labour and trouble to ensure us keeping the faith."&lt;ref name=Biography31/&gt;

Prior to her death, Mabel Tolkien had assigned the guardianship of her sons to her close friend, Fr. Francis Xavier Morgan of the [[Birmingham Oratory]], who was assigned to bring them up as good Catholics. In a 1965 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled the influence of the man whom he always called "Father Francis": "He was an upper-class Welsh-Spaniard Tory, and seemed to some just a pottering old gossip. He wasand he was ''not''. I first learned charity and forgiveness from him; and in the light of it pierced even the 'liberal' darkness out of which I came, knowing more [i.e. Tolkien having grown up knowing more] about '[[Mary I of England|Bloody Mary]]' than the [[Mother of Jesus]]who was never mentioned except as an object of wicked worship by the Romanists."&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no.&amp;nbsp;267.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his mother's death, Tolkien grew up in the [[Edgbaston]] area of Birmingham and attended [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]], and later [[St. Philip's School]]. In 1903, he won a Foundation Scholarship and returned to King Edward's. While a pupil there, Tolkien was one of the cadets from the school's [[Officers Training Corps]] who helped "line the route" for the 1910 [[coronation]] parade of King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]]. Like the other cadets from King Edward's, Tolkien was posted just outside the gates of [[Buckingham Palace]].&lt;ref name=Letters306&gt;''Letters'', no. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Edgbaston, Tolkien lived there in the shadow of [[Perrott's Folly]] and the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] tower of [[Edgbaston Waterworks]], which may have influenced the images of the dark towers within his works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birminghamheritage.org.uk/tolkien.html J.R.R.

===Youth===
While in his early teens, Tolkien had his first encounter with a [[constructed language]], Animalic, an invention of his cousins, Mary and Marjorie Incledon. At that time, he was studying Latin and Anglo-Saxon. Their interest in Animalic soon died away, but Mary and others, including Tolkien himself, invented a new and more complex language called Nevbosh. The next constructed language he came to work with, Naffarin, would be his own creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/vice.htm |title=Tolkien's Not-So-Secret Vice |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122010424/http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/vice.htm |archivedate=22 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lordfingulfin.webs.com/earlierlanguages.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224110153/http://lordfingulfin.webs.com/earlierlanguages.htm|title=Tolkien's Languages|archivedate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkien learned [[Esperanto]] some time before 1909. Around 10 June 1909 he composed "The Book of the Foxrook", a sixteen-page notebook, where the "earliest example of one of his invented alphabets" appears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Perry C. |last=Bramlett |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ef3-s6fixIC&amp;pg=PA136 |title=I Am in Fact a Hobbit: An Introduction to the Life and Works of J.

In 1911, while they were at King Edward's School, Tolkien and three friends, Rob Gilson, Geoffrey Bache Smith and Christopher Wiseman, formed a semi-secret society they called the T.C.B.S. The initials stood for Tea Club and Barrovian Society, alluding to their fondness for drinking tea in Barrow's Stores near the school and, secretly, in the school library.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', pp.&amp;nbsp;5354.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Tolkien and the Great War'', p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving school, the members stayed in touch and, in December 1914, they held a "council" in London at Wiseman's home. For Tolkien, the result of this meeting was a strong dedication to writing poetry.

In 1911, Tolkien went on a summer holiday in Switzerland, a trip that he recollects vividly in a 1968 letter,&lt;ref name=Letters306/&gt; noting that [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s journey across the [[Misty Mountains]] ("including the glissade down the slithering stones into the pine woods") is directly based on his adventures as their party of 12 hiked from [[Interlaken]] to [[Lauterbrunnen]] and on to camp in the [[moraine]]s &lt;!-- Tolkien spells "morains", but this is not a direct quote. Oxford English Dictionary offers standardized spelling of "moraines".--&gt; beyond [[Mrren]]. Fifty-seven years later, Tolkien remembered his regret at leaving the view of the eternal snows of [[Jungfrau]] and [[Silberhorn]], "the Silvertine ([[Celebdil]]) of my dreams". They went across the [[Kleine Scheidegg]] to [[Grindelwald]] and on across the [[Grosse Scheidegg]] to [[Meiringen]]. They continued across the [[Grimsel Pass]], through the upper [[Valais]] to [[Brig, Switzerland|Brig]] and on to the [[Aletsch glacier]] and [[Zermatt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.valais-wallis-digital.ch/de/a/#!/explore/cards/173 |title=1911  J.R.R.

In October of the same year, Tolkien began studying at [[Exeter College, Oxford]]. He initially studied [[Classics]] but changed his course in 1913 to English Language and [[English Literature|Literature]], graduating in 1915 with [[first-class honours]] in his final examinations.&lt;ref name = "RoyalMail"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Wayne G.

===Courtship and marriage===
At the age of 16, J.R.R. Tolkien met [[Edith Tolkien|Edith Mary Bratt]], who was three years his senior, when he and his brother Hilary moved into the boarding house where she lived in Duchess Road, [[Edgbaston]]. According to Humphrey Carpenter,
{{quote|Edith and Ronald took to frequenting Birmingham teashops, especially one which had a balcony overlooking the pavement. There they would sit and throw sugarlumps into the hats of passers-by, moving to the next table when the sugar bowl was empty. ... With two people of their personalities and in their position, romance was bound to flourish. Both were orphans in need of affection, and they found that they could give it to each other. During the summer of 1909, they decided that they were in love.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;40.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His guardian, Father Morgan, viewed Edith as the reason for Tolkien's having "muffed" his exams and considered it "altogether unfortunate"&lt;ref name="Letters, No. 43"&gt;''Letters'', No. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; that his surrogate son was romantically involved with an older, [[Church of England|Protestant]] woman. He prohibited him from meeting, talking to, or even corresponding with her until he was 21. He obeyed this prohibition to the letter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doughan |first=David |year=2002 |url=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/tolkien/biography.html#2 |title=War, Lost Tales and Academia |work=J. R. R. Tolkien: A Biographical Sketch |accessdate=12 March 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303050751/http://www.tolkiensociety.org/tolkien/biography.html |archivedate=3 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with one notable early exception, over which Father Morgan threatened to cut short his university career if he did not stop.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;43.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled:
{{quote|I had to choose between disobeying and grieving (or deceiving) a guardian who had been a father to me, more than most fathers ... and "dropping" the love-affair until I was 21. I don't regret my decision, though it was very hard on my lover. But it was not my fault. She was completely free and under no vow to me, and I should have had no just complaint (except according to the unreal romantic code) if she had got married to someone else. For very nearly ''three'' years I did not see or write to my lover. It was extremely hard, especially at first. The effects were not wholly good: I fell back into folly and slackness and misspent a good deal of my first year at college.&lt;ref name="Letters, No. 43"/&gt;}}

On the evening of his 21st birthday, Tolkien wrote to Edith, who was living with family friend C. H. Jessop at [[Cheltenham]]. He declared that he had never ceased to love her and asked her to marry him. Edith replied that she had already accepted the proposal of George Field, the brother of one of her closest schoolfriends. Edith said, however, that she had agreed to marry Field only because she felt "on the shelf" and had begun to doubt that Tolkien still cared for her. She explained that, because of Tolkien's letter, everything had changed.

On 8 January 1913, Tolkien travelled by train to Cheltenham and was met on the platform by Edith. The two took a walk into the countryside, sat under a railway viaduct, and talked. By the end of the day, Edith had agreed to accept Tolkien's proposal. She wrote to Field and returned her engagement ring. Field was "dreadfully upset at first", and the Field family was "insulted and angry".&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', pp.&amp;nbsp;6769.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon learning of Edith's new plans, Jessop wrote to her guardian, "I have nothing to say against Tolkien, he is a cultured gentleman, but his prospects are poor in the extreme, and when he will be in a position to marry I cannot imagine. Had he adopted a profession it would have been different."&lt;ref&gt;''The Tolkien Family Album'', (1992), page 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following their engagement, Edith reluctantly announced that she was converting to Catholicism at Tolkien's insistence.  Jessop, "like many others of his age and class ... strongly [[anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]]", was infuriated, and he ordered Edith to find other lodgings.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edith Bratt and Ronald Tolkien were formally engaged at Birmingham in January 1913, and married at [[St. Mary Immaculate Roman Catholic Church, Warwick]], on 22 March 1916.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;86.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1941 letter to Michael, Tolkien expressed admiration for his wife's willingness to marry a man with no job, little money, and no prospects except the likelihood of being killed in the Great War.&lt;ref name="Letters, No. 43"/&gt;

===First World War===
In August 1914 the United Kingdom entered the [[First World War]]. Tolkien's relatives were shocked when he elected not to immediately volunteer for the [[British Army]]. In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled, "In those days chaps joined up, or were scorned publicly. It was a nasty cleft to be in for a young man with too much imagination and little physical courage."&lt;ref name="Letters, No. 43"/&gt;

Instead, Tolkien, "endured the obloquy",&lt;ref name="Letters, No. 43"/&gt; and entered a programme wherein he delayed enlistment until completing his degree. By the time he passed his Finals in July 1915, Tolkien recalled that the hints were "becoming outspoken from relatives".&lt;ref name="Letters, No. 43"/&gt; He was then commissioned as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Lancashire Fusiliers]] on 15 July 1915.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', pp.&amp;nbsp;7785.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29232|page=6968|date=16 July 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; He trained with the 13th (Reserve) Battalion on [[Cannock Chase]], [[Staffordshire]], for eleven months. In a letter to Edith, Tolkien complained, "Gentlemen are rare among the superiors, and even human beings rare indeed."&lt;ref&gt;''Tolkien and the Great War'', p.&amp;nbsp;94.&lt;/ref&gt; Following their wedding, Lieutenant and Mrs. Tolkien took up lodgings near the training camp.

On 2 June 1916, Tolkien received a telegram summoning him to [[Folkestone]] for posting to France. The Tolkiens spent the night before his departure in a room at the Plough &amp; Harrow Hotel in [[Edgbaston]], Birmingham.

He later wrote, "Junior officers were being killed off, a dozen a minute. Parting from my wife then&amp;nbsp;... it was like a death."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in John Garth, ''Tolkien and the Great War'', p.&amp;nbsp;138.&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
On 5 June 1916, Tolkien boarded a troop transport for an overnight voyage to [[Calais]]. Like other soldiers arriving for the first time, he was sent to the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]]'s (BEF) base depot at [[taples]]. On 7 June, he was informed that he had been assigned as a signals officer to the 11th (Service) Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers. The battalion was part of the [[74th Brigade (United Kingdom)|74th Brigade]], [[25th Division (United Kingdom)|25th Division]].

While waiting to be summoned to his unit, Tolkien sank into boredom. To pass the time, he composed a poem entitled ''The Lonely Isle'', which was inspired by his feelings during the sea crossing to Calais. To evade the British Army's [[postal censorship]], he also developed a code of dots by which Edith could track his movements.&lt;ref&gt;Garth, John. ''Tolkien and the Great War'', Boston, Houghton Mifflin 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;144145.&lt;/ref&gt;

He left taples on 27 June 1916 and joined his battalion at [[Rubempr]], near [[Amiens]].&lt;ref&gt;Garth (2003), pages 147148.&lt;/ref&gt; He found himself commanding enlisted men who were drawn mainly from the mining, milling, and weaving towns of Lancashire.&lt;ref&gt;Garth (2003), pp.&amp;nbsp;148149.&lt;/ref&gt; According to John Garth, he "felt an affinity for these working class men", but military protocol forbade him from developing friendships with "[[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]". Instead, he was required to "take charge of them, discipline them, train them, and probably censor their letters ... If possible, he was supposed to inspire their love and loyalty."&lt;ref name="Garth149"&gt;Garth (2003), p.&amp;nbsp;149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkien later lamented, "The most improper job of any man ... is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity."&lt;ref name="Garth149"/&gt;

====Battle of the Somme====
Tolkien arrived at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]] in early July 1916. In between terms behind the lines at [[Bouzincourt]], he participated in the assaults on the [[Schwaben Redoubt]] and the [[Leipzig salient]]. Tolkien's time in combat was a terrible stress for Edith, who feared that every knock on the door might carry news of her husband's death. To get around the [[British Army]]'s [[postal censorship]], the Tolkiens developed a secret code for his letters home. By using the code, Edith could track her husband's movements on a map of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. According to the memoirs of the Reverend Mervyn S. Evers, [[Anglican]] chaplain to the Lancashire Fusiliers:
[[File:Schwaben Redoubt by William Orpen IWM Art.IWM ART 3000.jpg|thumb|right|''The Schwaben Redoubt'', painting by William Orpen. [[Imperial War Museum]], London.]]

{{quote|On one occasion I spent the night with the Brigade Machine Gun Officer and the Signals Officer in one of the captured German dugouts ... We dossed down for the night in the hopes of getting some sleep, but it was not to be. We no sooner lay down than hordes of lice got up. So we went round to the Medical Officer, who was also in the dugout with his equipment, and he gave us some ointment which he assured us would keep the little brutes away. We anointed ourselves all over with the stuff and again lay down in great hopes, but it was not to be, because instead of discouraging them it seemed to act like a kind of ''[[hors d'oeuvre]]'' and the little beggars went at their feast with renewed vigour.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Garth (2003), p.&amp;nbsp;200.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 27 October 1916, as his battalion attacked [[Regina Trench]], Tolkien came down with [[trench fever]], a disease carried by the [[lice]]. He was invalided to England on 8 November 1916.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;93.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his dearest school friends were killed in the war. Among their number were Rob Gilson of the Tea Club and Barrovian Society, who was killed on the [[first day of the Somme]] while leading his men in the assault on [[Beaumont Hamel]]. Fellow T.C.B.S. member Geoffrey Smith was killed during the same battle when a German artillery shell landed on a first aid post. Tolkien's battalion was almost completely wiped out following his return to England.

Tolkien might well have been killed himself, but he had suffered from health problems and had been removed from combat multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'' (2000 paperback edition), pp.&amp;nbsp;93, 103, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to John Garth: {{quote|Although [[Herbert Kitchener|Kitchener]]'s [[Kitchener's Army|army]] enshrined old social boundaries, it also chipped away at the class divide by throwing men from all walks of life into a desperate situation together. Tolkien wrote that the experience taught him, "a deep sympathy and feeling for the [[Tommy Atkins|Tommy]]; especially the plain soldier from the agricultural counties". He remained profoundly grateful for the lesson. For a long time, he had been imprisoned in a tower, not of pearl, but of ivory.&lt;ref&gt;Garth (2003), pp.&amp;nbsp;9495.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In later years, Tolkien indignantly declared that those who searched his works for parallels to the [[Second World War]] were entirely mistaken:
{{quote|One has indeed personally to come under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression; but as the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to be caught in youth by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than to be involved in 1939 and the following years. By 1918 all but one of my close friends were dead.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lord of the Rings''. Preface to the Second Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Home front====
A weak and emaciated Tolkien spent the remainder of the war alternating between hospitals and garrison duties, being deemed medically unfit for general service.&lt;ref&gt;Garth (2003), pp.&amp;nbsp;207 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien's [[Webley Revolver|Webley .455]] service revolver was put on display in 2006 as part of a [[Battle of the Somme]] exhibition in the [[Imperial War Museum]], London. (See {{cite web |url=http://archive.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.2211 |title=Personal Stories: John Ronald Reuel Tolkien |work=Battle of the Somme |publisher=Imperial War Museum |accessdate=16 July 2012 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and {{cite web |url=http://archive.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.2211 |title=FIR 11492: Webley .455 Mark 6 (VI military) |work=Imperial War Museum Collection Search |publisher=Imperial War Museum |accessdate=16 July 2012 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}) Several of his service records, mostly dealing with his health problems, can be seen at the National Archives.

During his recovery in a cottage in [[Little Haywood]], [[Staffordshire, England|Staffordshire]], he began to work on what he called ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', beginning with ''[[The Fall of Gondolin]]''. ''Lost Tales'' represented Tolkien's attempt to create a mythology for England, a project he would abandon without ever completing.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zWzAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT98 98] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116212207/https://books.google.com/books?id=zWzAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT98 |date=16 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout 1917 and 1918 his illness kept recurring, but he had recovered enough to do home service at various camps. It was at this time that Edith bore their first child, John Francis Reuel Tolkien. In a 1941 letter, Tolkien described his son John as "(conceived and carried during the starvation-year of 1917 and the great [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|U-Boat campaign]]) round about the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]], when the end of the war seemed as far off as it does now".&lt;ref name="Letters, No. 43"/&gt;

Tolkien was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant on 6 January 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30588 |supp=y|page=3561|date=19 March 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was stationed at [[Kingston upon Hull]], he and Edith went walking in the woods at nearby [[Roos]], and Edith began to dance for him in a clearing among the flowering hemlock. After his wife's death in 1971, Tolkien remembered,{{quote|I never called Edith ''Luthien''but she was the source of the story that in time became the chief part of the ''Silmarillion''. It was first conceived in a small woodland glade filled with hemlocks&lt;ref&gt;Following rural English usage, Tolkien used the name "hemlock" for various plants with white flowers in umbels, resembling [[poison hemlock|hemlock]] (''Conium maculatum''); the flowers Edith danced among were more probably [[cow parsley]] (''Anthriscus sylvestris'') or [[wild carrot]] (''Daucus carota''). See John Garth, ''Tolkien and the Great War'' (Harper Collins/Houghton Mifflin 2003), and Peter Gilliver, Jeremy Marshall, &amp; Edmund Weiner, ''The Ring of Words'' (OUP 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; at Roos in Yorkshire (where I was for a brief time in command of an outpost of the Humber Garrison in 1917, and she was able to live with me for a while). In those days her hair was raven, her skin clear, her eyes brighter than you have seen them, and she could singand ''dance''. But the story has gone crooked, &amp; I am left, and ''I'' cannot plead before the inexorable [[Mandos]].&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This incident inspired the account of the meeting of [[Beren and Lthien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cater |first=Bill |date=4 December 2001 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4726863/We-talked-of-love-death-and-fairy-tales.html |title=We talked of love, death, and fairy tales |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=13 March 2012 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131153700/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4726863/We-talked-of-love-death-and-fairy-tales.html |archivedate=31 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 November 1920, Tolkien was demobilized and left the army, retaining his rank of lieutenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32110 |supp=y|page=10711|date=2 November 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first civilian job after World War I was at the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', where he worked mainly on the history and etymology of words of Germanic origin beginning with the letter ''W''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Gilliver| first=Peter|title=The Ring of Words: Tolkien and the OED|publisher=OUP| year=2006|first2=Jeremy |last2=Marshall |first3=Edmund |last3=Weiner}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, he took up a post as [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in English Language at the [[University of Leeds]], and became the youngest professor there.&lt;ref name="Grotta2001 page 64 ff"&gt;{{cite book|first=Daniel |last=Grotta |title=J.R.R.

V. Gordon]], both becoming academic standard works for several decades. He also translated ''Sir Gawain'', ''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]'', and ''[[Sir Orfeo]]''. In 1925, he returned to Oxford as [[Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon]], with a fellowship at [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]].

In mid-1919 he began to privately tutor undergraduates, most importantly those of [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]] and [[St Hugh's College, Oxford| St Hugh's College]] given that the women's colleges were in great need of good teachers in their early years.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6Q_GAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=jrr+tolkien+lady+margaret+hall&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=miY3YU94JS&amp;sig=txgrLdGNNwwoYeesiddtjCzvUQU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=lady%20margaret%20hall&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time at [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]] Tolkien wrote ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and the first two volumes of ''The Lord of the Rings'', whilst living at 20 [[Northmoor Road]] in [[North Oxford]] (where a [[blue plaque]] was placed in 2002). He also published a philological essay in 1932 on the name "[[Nodens]]", following Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]]'s unearthing of a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Asclepeion]] at [[Lydney Park]], Gloucestershire, in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Name Nodens'' (1932) in the bibliographical listing. For the etymology, see [[Nodens#Etymology]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Beowulf''====
In the 1920s, Tolkien undertook a translation of ''[[Beowulf]]'', which he finished in 1926. He never published it. It was finally edited by his son and published in 2014, more than forty years after Tolkien's death and almost 90 years since its completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Acocella |first=Joan |date=2 June 2014 |title=Slaying Monsters: Tolkien's 'Beowulf' |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2014/06/02/140602crbo_books_acocella?currentPage=all |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=2 June 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530222018/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2014/06/02/140602crbo_books_acocella?currentPage=all |archivedate=30 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten years after finishing his translation, Tolkien gave a highly acclaimed lecture on the work, entitled "[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics]]", which had a lasting influence on ''Beowulf'' research.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;143.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis E. Nicholson said that the article Tolkien wrote about ''Beowulf'' is "widely recognized as a turning point in Beowulfian criticism", noting that Tolkien established the primacy of the poetic nature of the work as opposed to its purely linguistic elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Ramey|first=Bill| date= 30 March 1998|url= http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/billramey/beowulf.htm |title=The Unity of Beowulf: Tolkien and the Critics|work = Wisdom's Children|accessdate =13 March 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060421094854/http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/billramey/beowulf.htm |archivedate = 21 April 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the consensus of scholarship deprecated ''Beowulf'' for dealing with childish battles with monsters rather than realistic tribal warfare; Tolkien argued that the author of ''Beowulf'' was addressing human destiny in general, not as limited by particular tribal politics, and therefore the monsters were essential to the poem.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien: ''[[Finn and Hengest]]''. Chiefly, p.4 in the Introduction by [[Alan Bliss]].&lt;/ref&gt; Where ''Beowulf'' does deal with specific tribal struggles, as at [[Finnsburg]], Tolkien argued firmly against reading in fantastic elements.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien: ''[[Finn and Hengest]]'', the discussion of ''Eotena'', ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay, Tolkien also revealed how highly he regarded Beowulf: "Beowulf is among my most valued sources", and this influence may be seen throughout his [[Middle-earth]] [[legendarium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Kennedy|first=Michael|year=2001|url= http://www.triode.net.au/~dragon/tilkal/issue1/beowulf.html |title=Tolkien and Beowulf&amp;nbsp; Warriors of Middle-earth|work=Amon Hen|accessdate =18 May 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060509110607/http://www.triode.net.au/~dragon/tilkal/issue1/beowulf.html |archivedate = 9 May 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Humphrey Carpenter]], Tolkien had an ingenious means of beginning his series of lectures on ''Beowulf'':{{quote|He would come silently into the room, fix the audience with his gaze, and suddenly begin to declaim in a resounding voice the opening lines of the poem in the original Anglo-Saxon, commencing with a great cry of ''[[wikt:hwt|Hwt]]!'' (the first word of this and several other Old English poems), which some undergraduates took to be "Quiet!" It was not so much a recitation as a dramatic performance, an impersonation of an Anglo-Saxon bard in a mead hall, and it impressed generations of students because it brought home to them that ''Beowulf'' was not just a set text to be read for the purposes of examination, but a powerful piece of dramatic poetry.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;133.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Decades later, [[W.H. Auden]] wrote to his former professor,{{quote|I don't think that I have ever told you what an unforgettable experience it was for me as an undergraduate, hearing you recite ''Beowulf''. The voice was the voice of [[Gandalf]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;}}

====Second World War====

In the run-up to the [[Second World War]], Tolkien was earmarked as a [[Cryptanalysis|codebreaker]].&lt;ref name="spy1"&gt;''Letters'', no. 35 (see also editorial note).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spy3"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Wayne G.|last1=Hammond|author1-link=Wayne G.

In 1945, Tolkien moved to [[Merton College, Oxford]], becoming the [[Merton Professors|Merton Professor of English Language and Literature]],&lt;ref name="Grotta2001 page 110 ff"&gt;{{cite book|first=Daniel |last=Grotta |title=J.R.R.

He served as an external examiner for [[University College, Dublin]], for many years. In 1954 Tolkien received an honorary degree from the [[National University of Ireland]] (of which U.C.D. was a constituent college). Tolkien completed ''The Lord of the Rings'' in 1948, close to a decade after the first sketches.

Tolkien also translated the [[Book of Jonah]] for the ''[[Jerusalem Bible]]'', which was published in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson, John. ''The Oxford Illustrated History of the Bible'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
The Tolkiens had four children: John Francis Reuel Tolkien (17 November 1917  22 January 2003), Michael Hilary Reuel Tolkien (22 October 1920  27 February 1984), [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher John Reuel Tolkien]] (born 21 November 1924) and Priscilla Mary Anne Reuel Tolkien (born 18 June 1929). Tolkien was very devoted to his children and sent them illustrated [[The Father Christmas Letters|letters from Father Christmas]] when they were young. Each year more characters were added, such as the North Polar Bear (Father Christmas's helper), the Snow Man (his gardener), Ilbereth the elf (his secretary), and various other, minor characters. The major characters would relate tales of Father Christmas's battles against [[goblin]]s who rode on bats and the various pranks committed by the North Polar Bear.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. R. Tolkien, [[The Father Christmas Letters]] (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement and later years===
[[File:Oxford Tolkien.JPG|Bust of Tolkien in the chapel of [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]], [[Oxford]]|thumb]]
During his life in retirement, from 1959 up to his death in 1973, Tolkien received steadily increasing public attention and literary fame. In 1961, his friend [[C. S. Lewis]] even nominated him for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=16784 |title=Nomination Database |publisher=Nobel Foundation |accessdate=20 April 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421094448/http://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=16784 |archivedate=21 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sales of his books were so profitable that he regretted that he had not chosen early retirement.&lt;ref name=DoughanBio/&gt; At first, he wrote enthusiastic answers to readers' enquiries, but he became increasingly unhappy about the sudden popularity of his books with the 1960s counter-culture movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Meras |first=Phyllis |date=15 January 1967 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-gandalf.html |title=Go, Go, Gandalf |work=The New York Times |accessdate=12 March 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411062436/http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-gandalf.html |archivedate=11 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1972 letter, he deplored having become a [[Tolkien fandom|cult-figure]], but admitted that "even the nose of a very modest idol ... cannot remain entirely untickled by the sweet smell of incense!"&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fan attention became so intense that Tolkien had to take his phone number out of the public directory,&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually he and Edith moved to [[Bournemouth]], which was then a seaside resort patronized by the British upper middle class. Tolkien's status as a best-selling author gave them easy entry into polite society, but Tolkien deeply missed the company of his fellow [[Inklings]]. Edith, however, was overjoyed to step into the role of a society hostess, which had been the reason that Tolkien selected Bournemouth in the first place.

According to [[Humphrey Carpenter]]:

{{quote|Those friends who knew Ronald and Edith Tolkien over the years never doubted that there was deep affection between them. It was visible in the small things, the almost absurd degree in which each worried about the other's health, and the care in which they chose and wrapped each other's birthday presents; and in the large matters, the way in which Ronald willingly abandoned such a large part of his life in retirement to give Edith the last years in Bournemouth that he felt she deserved, and the degree in which she showed pride in his fame as an author. A principal source of happiness to them was their shared love of their family. This bound them together until the end of their lives, and it was perhaps the strongest force in the marriage. They delighted to discuss and mull over every detail of the lives of their children, and later their grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey Carpenter, "Tolkien: The Authorized Biography", page 158.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Final years===
Edith Tolkien died on 29 November 1971, at the age of 82. According to [[Simon Tolkien]]:
[[File:Tolkien's grave, Wolvercote Cemetery.jpg|thumb|The grave of J. R. R. and [[Edith Tolkien]], [[Wolvercote Cemetery]], [[Oxford]]]]
{{quote|My grandmother died two years before my grandfather and he came back to live in Oxford. [[Merton College]] gave him rooms just off the High Street. I went there frequently and he'd take me to lunch in the Eastgate Hotel. Those lunches were rather wonderful for a 12-year-old boy spending time with his grandfather, but sometimes he seemed sad. There was one visit when he told me how much he missed my grandmother. It must have been very strange for him being alone after they had been married for more than 50 years.&lt;ref name="SimonTolkien"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simontolkien.com/mygrandfather.html |first=Simon |last=Tolkien |title=My Grandfather JRR Tolkien |year=2003 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927051931/http://www.simontolkien.com/mygrandfather.html |archivedate=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tolkien was appointed by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] a Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in the [[1972 New Year Honours]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=45554 |date=1 January 1972 |page=9 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; and received the insignia of the Order at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 28 March 1972.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 334 (editorial note).&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year Oxford University conferred upon him an honorary [[Doctor of Letters|Doctorate of Letters]].&lt;ref name = "RoyalMail" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=J.R.R.

Tolkien had the name [[Lthien]] engraved on Edith's tombstone at [[Wolvercote Cemetery]], [[Oxford]]. When Tolkien died 21 months later on 2 September 1973 from a bleeding ulcer and chest infection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TyKDAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT35&amp;lpg=PT35&amp;dq=jrr+tolkien+bleeding+ulcer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0IItkINEtK&amp;sig=F6BeTkEauQPZNUWu_krBfw8bDx4&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6kbv2geLVAhWDJJoKHcGkByYQ6AEIRTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=jrr+tolkien+bleeding+ulcer&amp;f=false|title=J.

The engravings read:

{{Quote box|width=20%|align=center|quote=&lt;center&gt;Edith Mary Tolkien&lt;br /&gt;'''Lthien'''&lt;br /&gt;18891971&lt;br /&gt;John Ronald&lt;br /&gt;Reuel Tolkien&lt;br /&gt;'''Beren '''&lt;br /&gt;18921973&lt;/center&gt;|source=[[Wolvercote Cemetery]], [[Oxford]]|qalign=center}}

In Tolkien's [[Middle-earth]] [[legendarium]], Lthien was the most beautiful of all the [[Children of Ilvatar]], and forsook her [[immortality]] for her love of the mortal warrior Beren. After Beren was captured by the forces of the [[Dark Lord (fiction)|Dark Lord]] [[Morgoth]], Lthien rode to his rescue upon the talking [[wolf hunting with dogs|wolfhound]] [[Huan (Middle-earth)|Huan]]. Ultimately, when Beren was slain in battle against the demonic wolf [[Carcharoth]], Lthien, like [[Orpheus]], approached the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]], the angelic order of beings placed in charge of the world by Eru (God), and persuaded them to restore her beloved to life.

==Views==
[[File:Eagle and Child (interior).jpg|thumb|right|The Corner of [[the Eagle and Child]] Pub, Oxford, where the [[Inklings]] met (19301950)]]
Tolkien was a devout [[Roman Catholic]], and in his religious and political views he was mostly a traditionalist moderate, with [[Libertarianism|libertarian]], [[Distributism|distributist]], and [[monarchism|monarchist]] leanings, in the sense of favouring established conventions and orthodoxies over innovation and modernization, whilst castigating government bureaucracy; in 1943 he wrote, "My political opinions lean more and more to Anarchy ([[philosophical anarchism|philosophically understood]], meaning abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs)or to 'unconstitutional' [[monarchism|Monarchy]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 52, to Christopher Tolkien, 29 November 1943&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he did not often write or speak about it, Tolkien advocated the dismantling of the [[British Empire]] and even of the United Kingdom. In a 1936 letter to a former student, Belgian linguist Simonne d'Ardenne, he wrote, "The political situation is dreadful... I have the greatest sympathy with Belgiumwhich is about the right size of any country! I wish my own were bounded still by the seas of the [[River Tweed|Tweed]] and the walls of Wales... we folk do at least know something of mortality and eternity and when [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] (or a Frenchman) says 'Germany (or France) must live forever' we know that he lies."&lt;ref&gt;"The Tolkien Family Album", (1992), page 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkien had an intense hatred for the side effects of industrialization, which he considered to be devouring the English countryside and [[simple living|simpler life]]. For most of his adult life, he was disdainful of cars, preferring to ride a bicycle.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', nos. 64, 131, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude can be seen in his work, most famously in the portrayal of the forced "industrialization" of the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]] in ''The Lord of the Rings''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | title = J. R. R. Tolkien&amp;nbsp; Creator of Middle Earth | publisher = [[New Line Cinema]] | type = DVD |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many commentators&lt;ref name=MEreffotrForeword&gt;{{ME-ref|fotr|Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt; have remarked on a number of potential parallels between the Middle-earth saga and events in Tolkien's lifetime. ''The Lord of the Rings'' is often thought to represent England during and immediately after World War{{nbsp}}II. Tolkien ardently rejected this opinion in the foreword to the second edition of the novel, stating he preferred applicability to allegory.&lt;ref name=MEreffotrForeword/&gt; This theme is taken up at greater length in his essay "[[On Fairy-Stories]]", where he argues that fairy-stories are so apt because they are consistent both within themselves and with some truths about reality. He concludes that Christianity itself follows this pattern of inner consistency and external truth. His belief in the fundamental truths of Christianity leads commentators to find Christian themes in ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien objected strongly to C.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Lewis's use of religious references in his stories, which were often overtly allegorical.&lt;ref&gt;Longenecker, Dwight (2008). "[http://www.speroforum.com/a/16698/Why-Tolkien-said-No-to-Narnia Why Tolkien said No to Narnia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430143646/http://www.speroforum.com/a/16698/Why-Tolkien-said-No-to-Narnia |date=30 April 2011 }}", Spero News, 12 November 2008.

Retrieved 1 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

His love of myths and his devout faith came together in his assertion that he believed [[mythology]] to be the divine echo of "the Truth".&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Ralph C. [http://www.leaderu.com/humanities/wood-biography.html Biography of J. R. R. Tolkien (18921973)]. Addison, Texas; Leadership University. Updated 13 July 2002. Retrieved 28 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This view was expressed in his poem and essay entitled ''[[Mythopoeia (poem)|Mythopoeia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, Mythopoeia (the poem), c. 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; His theory that myths held "fundamental truths" became a central theme of the Inklings in general.

===Religion===
Tolkien's devout Roman Catholic faith was a significant factor in the conversion of [[C.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Lewis]] from [[atheism]] to Christianity, although Tolkien was dismayed that Lewis chose to join the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref name="CSL"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carpenter|first=Humphrey|year=1978|title=The Inklings|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|isbn=0-00-774869-8}} Lewis was brought up in the [[Church of Ireland]].&lt;/ref&gt;

He once said, "It may be said that the chief purpose of life, for any one of us, is to increase according to our capacity our knowledge of God by all the means we have, and to be moved by it to praise and thanks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ware |first=Jim |title=Finding God in The Hobbit |page=xxii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N_0VhzQKIIAC&amp;pg=PR22 |isbn=978-1-4143-0596-7 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his grandson [[Simon Tolkien]], Tolkien in the last years of his life was disappointed by some of the [[liturgical]] reforms and changes implemented after the [[Second Vatican Council]]:{{quote|I vividly remember going to church with him in Bournemouth. He was a devout Roman Catholic and it was soon after the Church had changed the liturgy from Latin to English. My grandfather obviously didn't agree with this and made all the responses very loudly in Latin while the rest of the congregation answered in English. I found the whole experience quite excruciating, but my grandfather was oblivious. He simply had to do what he believed to be right.&lt;ref name="SimonTolkien"/&gt;}}

===Politics and race===

====Anti-Communism====
Tolkien voiced support for the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] (eventually led by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]) upon hearing that communist [[Second Spanish Republic|Republicans]] were destroying churches and [[Red Terror (Spain)|killing priests and nuns]].&lt;ref name="Letters83"&gt;''Letters'', no. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkien was contemptuous of [[Joseph Stalin]]. During World War{{nbsp}}II, Tolkien referred to Stalin as "that bloodthirsty old murderer".&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1961, Tolkien sharply criticized a Swedish commentator who suggested that ''The Lord of the Rings'' was an [[anti-communist]] [[parable]] and identified [[Sauron]] with Stalin. Tolkien said, "I utterly repudiate any such ''reading'', which angers me. The situation was conceived long before the [[October Revolution|Russian revolution]]. Such [[allegory]] is entirely foreign to my thought."&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opposition to National Socialism====
Tolkien vocally opposed [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] prior to the [[Second World War]], and was known to especially despise [[Nazi]] racist and anti-Semitic ideology. In 1938, the publishing house Rtten &amp; Loening Verlag was preparing to release ''The Hobbit'' in [[Nazi Germany]]. To Tolkien's outrage, he was asked beforehand whether he was of [[Aryan race|Aryan]] origin. In a letter to his British publisher [[Stanley Unwin (publisher)|Stanley Unwin]], he condemned Nazi "race-doctrine" as "wholly pernicious and unscientific". He added that he had many [[Jewish]] friends and was considering "letting a German translation go hang".&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 29, to Stanley Unwin, 25 July 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; He provided two letters to Rtten &amp; Loening and instructed Unwin to send whichever he preferred. The more tactful letter was sent and was lost during the later bombing of Germany. In the unsent letter, Tolkien makes the point that "[[Aryan]]" is a linguistic term, denoting speakers of [[Indo-Iranian languages]]. He continued,{{quote|But if I am to understand that you are enquiring whether I am of ''Jewish'' origin, I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have ''no'' ancestors of that gifted people. My great-great-grandfather came to England in the 18th century from Germany: the main part of my descent is therefore purely English, and I am an English subjectwhich should be sufficient. I have been accustomed, nonetheless, to regard my German name with pride, and continued to do so throughout the period of the late regrettable war, in which I served in the English army. I cannot, however, forbear to comment that if impertinent and irrelevant inquiries of this sort are to become the rule in matters of literature, then the time is not far distant when a German name will no longer be a source of pride.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, he expressed his resentment at the distortion of Germanic history in "Nordicism":{{quote|You have to understand the good in things, to detect the real evil. But no one ever calls on me to "broadcast" or do a postscript. Yet I suppose I know better than most what is the truth about this "Nordic" nonsense. Anyway, I have in this war a burning private grudge... against that ruddy little ignoramus Adolf Hitler ... Ruining, perverting, misapplying, and making for ever accursed, that noble northern spirit, a supreme contribution to Europe, which I have ever loved, and tried to present in its true light. Nowhere, incidentally, was it nobler than in England, nor more early sanctified and Christianized.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1968, he objected to a description of Middle-earth as "[[Nordic race|Nordic]]", a term he said he disliked because of its association with [[Nordic theory|racialist theories]].&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Total war====
Tolkien criticized Allied use of [[total war]] tactics against civilians from [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Imperial Japan]]. In a 1945 letter to his son Christopher, he wrote:{{quote|We were supposed to have reached a stage of civilization in which it might still be necessary to execute a criminal, but not to gloat, or to hang his wife and child by him while the orc-crowd hooted. The destruction of Germany, be it 100 times merited, is one of the most appalling world-catastrophes. Well, well,you and I can do nothing about it. And that [should] be a measure of the amount of guilt that can justly be assumed to attach to any member of a country who is not a member of its actual Government. Well the first War of the Machines seems to be drawing to its final inconclusive chapterleaving, alas, everyone the poorer, many bereaved or maimed and millions dead, and only one thing triumphant: the Machines.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He also reacted with anger at the excesses of [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German]] propaganda during the war. In 1944, he wrote in a letter to his son Christopher:{{quote|...it is distressing to see the press grovelling in the gutter as low as Goebbels in his prime, shrieking that any German commander who holds out in a desperate situation (when, too, the military needs of his side clearly benefit) is a drunkard, and a besotted fanatic. ... There was a solemn article in the local paper seriously advocating systematic exterminating of the entire German nation as the only proper course after military victory: because, if you please, they are rattlesnakes, and don't know the difference between good and evil! (What of the writer?) The Germans have just as much right to declare the Poles and Jews exterminable vermin, subhuman, as we have to select the Germans: in other words, no right, whatever they have done.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He was horrified by the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], referring to the scientists of the [[Manhattan Project]] as "these lunatic physicists" and "[[Tower of Babel|Babel]]-builders".&lt;ref name="atom"&gt;''Letters'', no. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature===
During most of his own life [[conservationism]] was not yet on the political agenda, and Tolkien himself did not directly express conservationist viewsexcept in some private letters, in which he tells about his fondness for forests and sadness at tree-felling. In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=George |editor1-last=Clark |editor2-first=Daniel |editor2-last=Timmons |title=J.R.R.

==Writing==
Tolkien devised several themes that were reused in successive drafts of his ''[[legendarium]]'', beginning with ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', written while recuperating from illnesses contracted during [[The Battle of the Somme]]. The two most prominent stories, the tale of [[Beren and Lthien]] and that of [[Trin]], were carried forward into long narrative poems (published in ''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]'').

===Influences===
{{Main article|J. R. R. Tolkien's influences}}

====British adventure stories====
One of the greatest influences on Tolkien was the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] [[polymath]] [[William Morris]]. Tolkien wished to imitate Morris's prose and poetry romances,&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; from which he took hints for the names of features such as the [[Dead Marshes]] in ''The Lord of the Rings''&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mirkwood]],&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Douglas A. ''The Annotated Hobbit'', Boston, Houghton Mifflin 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;183, note&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt; along with some general aspects of approach.

[[Edward Wyke-Smith]]'s ''The Marvellous Land of Snergs'', with its "table-high" title characters, strongly influenced the incidents, themes, and depiction of Bilbo's race in ''The Hobbit''.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Douglas A. ''The Annotated Hobbit'', Boston, Houghton Mifflin 1988, pp.&amp;nbsp;67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkien also cited [[Henry Rider Haggard|H. Rider Haggard]]'s novel ''[[She (novel)|She]]'' in a telephone interview: "I suppose as a boy ''She'' interested me as much as anythinglike the Greek shard of Amyntas [Amenartas], which was the kind of machine by which everything got moving."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last = Resnick | first = Henry | year = 1967 | title = An Interview with Tolkien | magazine = [[Niekas]] | pages = 3747}}&lt;/ref&gt; A supposed facsimile of this [[potsherd]] appeared in Haggard's first edition, and the ancient inscription it bore, once translated, led the English characters to She's ancient kingdom.

Tolkien wrote of being impressed as a boy by [[Samuel Rutherford Crockett|S. R. Crockett]]'s historical novel ''The Black Douglas'' and of basing the Necromancer ([[Sauron]]) on its villain, [[Gilles de Retz]].&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', p. 391, footnote, quoted in Jared C. Lobdell ''The World of the Rings: Language, Religion, and Adventure in Tolkien'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Incidents in both ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' are similar in narrative and style to the novel,&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Douglas A. ''The Annotated Hobbit'', Boston, Houghton Mifflin 1988, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; and its overall style and imagery have been suggested as an influence on Tolkien.&lt;ref&gt;Lobdell, Jared C. (2004). ''The World of the Rings: Language, Religion, and Adventure in Tolkien'', pp. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

====European mythology====
Tolkien was inspired by early [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], especially [[Anglo-Saxons|Old English]], literature, [[Germanic poetry|poetry]], and [[Germanic paganism|mythology]], which were his chosen and much-loved areas of expertise. These sources of inspiration included [[Old English literature]] such as ''[[Beowulf]]'', [[Saga|Norse sagas]] such as the ''[[Volsunga saga]]'' and the ''[[Hervarar saga]]'',&lt;ref&gt;As described by Christopher Tolkien in ''Hervarar Saga ok Heidreks Konung'' (Oxford University, Trinity College).

Tolkien also acknowledged several non-Germanic influences or sources for some of his stories and ideas. [[Sophocles]]' play ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' he cited as inspiring elements of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[The Children of Hrin]]''. In addition, Tolkien first read [[William Forsell Kirby]]'s translation of the Finnish [[national epic]], the ''[[Kalevala]]'', while attending King Edward's School. He described its character of [[Vinminen]] as one of his influences for [[Gandalf the Grey]]. The ''Kalevala'''s [[antihero]] [[Kullervo]] was further described as an inspiration for [[Trin Turambar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Handwerk |first=Brian |date=1 March 2004 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/12/1219_tolkienroots.html |title=Lord of the Rings Inspired by an Ancient Epic |work=National Geographic News |accessdate=13 March 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316192124/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/12/1219_tolkienroots.html |archivedate=16 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dimitra Fimi]], [[Douglas A. Anderson]], John Garth, and many other prominent Tolkien scholars believe that Tolkien also drew influence from a variety of [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] ([[Irish mythology|Irish]], [[Scottish mythology|Scottish]] and [[Welsh mythology|Welsh]]) history and legends.&lt;ref name="Fimi"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Fimi|first = Dimitra|year = 2006|title = 'Mad' Elves and 'elusive beauty': some Celtic strands of Tolkien's mythology|journal = Folklore |volume = 117|issue = 2|pages = 156170 |publisher = West Virginia University Press|issn = 1547-3155|doi = 10.1080/00155870600707847 |jstor=30035484 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fimi | first = Dimitra | year = 2007 | title = Tolkien's {{'"}}Celtic" type of legends': Merging Traditions | journal = [[Tolkien Studies]] | volume = 4 | pages = 5171 | publisher = West Virginia University Press | issn = 1547-3155 | doi = 10.1353/tks.2007.0015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the ''Silmarillion'' manuscript was rejected, in part for its "eye-splitting" Celtic names, Tolkien denied their Celtic origin:
{{quote|Needless to say they are not Celtic! Neither are the tales. I do know Celtic things (many in their original languages Irish and Welsh), and feel for them a certain distaste: largely for their fundamental unreason. They have bright colour, but are like a broken stained glass window reassembled without design. They are in fact "mad" as your reader saysbut I don't believe I am.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="letter144"/&gt;}} Fimi pointed out that despite his dismissive remarks about "Celtic things" in 1937 that Tolkien was fluent in medieval Welsh (though not modern Welsh) and declared when delivering the first O'Donnell lectures at Oxford in 1954 about the influences of Celtic languages on the English language that "Welsh is beautiful".&lt;ref name="Fimi"/&gt; 

One of Tolkien's purposes when writing his Middle-earth books was to create what his biographer Humphrey Carter called a "mythology for England", complaining in a letter to Milton Waldman of the "poverty of my country: it had no stories of its own (bound up with its tongue and soil)" unlike the Celtic nations of Scotland, Ireland and Wales, which all had their own well developed mythologies.&lt;ref name="Fimi"/&gt; Tolkien himself never used the exact phrase "a mythology for England", but he often made statements to that effect, writing to one reader that his intention in writing the Middle-earth stories was "to restore to the English an epic tradition and present them with a mythology of their own".&lt;ref name="Fimi"/&gt; In the early 20th century, proponents of Irish nationalism like the poet William Butler Yeats, Lady Gregory and others had succeeded in linking in the public mind traditional Irish folk tales of fairies and elves to Irish national identity while denigrating English folk tales as being merely derivative of Irish folk tales.&lt;ref name="Fimi"/&gt; This had prompted a backlash by English writers, leading to a savage war of words about which nation had the more authentic and better fairy tales with for example the English essayist G. K. Chesterton engaging in a series of polemical essays with Yeats over the question of the superiority of Irish vs. English fairy tales.&lt;ref name="Fimi"/&gt; Even through there is nothing innately anti-English about Irish folklore, the way in which Irish mythology became associated with Irish nationalism, being promoted most enthusiastically by those favouring Irish independence, led many to perceive Irish mythology and folklore as Anglophobic.&lt;ref name="Fimi"/&gt; Tolkien with his determination to write a "mythology for England" was for this reason disinclined to admit to Celtic influences.&lt;ref name="Fimi"/&gt; Fimi noted in particular that the story of the Noldor, the Elves who fled Valinor for Middle-earth, resembles the story related in the ''[[Lebor Gabla renn]]'' of the semi-divine [[Tuatha D Danann]] who fled from what is variously described as a place in the north or Greece to conquer Ireland.&lt;ref name="Fimi"/&gt; Like Tolkien's Elves, the Tuatha D Danann are inferior to the gods, but superior to humans; being endowed with extraordinary skills as craftsmen, poets, warriors, and magicians.&lt;ref name="Fimi"/&gt; Likewise, after the triumph of humanity, both the Elves and the Tuatha D Danann are driven underground, which causes their "fading", leading them to become diminutive and pale.&lt;ref name="Fimi"/&gt;

====Catholicism====
Catholic theology and imagery played a part in fashioning Tolkien's creative imagination, suffused as it was by his deeply religious spirit.&lt;ref name=DayTolkiensRing/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bofetti|first=Jason|date=November 2001|url= http://www.crisismagazine.com/november2001/feature7.htm |title=Tolkien's Catholic Imagination|work = Crisis Magazine|accessdate =30 August 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821111145/http://www.crisismagazine.com/november2001/feature7.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=21 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien acknowledged this himself:
{{quote|''The Lord of the Rings'' is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work; unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision. That is why I have not put in, or have cut out, practically all references to anything like "religion", to cults or practices, in the imaginary world. For the religious element is absorbed into the story and the symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Specifically, [[Paul H. Kocher]] argues that Tolkien describes evil in the orthodox Christian way as the [[absence of good]]. He cites many examples in ''The Lord of the Rings'', such as Sauron's "Lidless Eye": "the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing". Kocher sees Tolkien's source as [[Thomas Aquinas]], "whom it is reasonable to suppose that Tolkien, as a medievalist and a Catholic, knows well".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kocher | first = Paul H. | year = 1972 | title = Master of Middle-earth: The Fiction of J. R. R. Tolkien | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | pages = 7677 | isbn = 0-395-14097-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Shippey]] makes the same point, but, instead of referring to Aquinas, says Tolkien was very familiar with [[Alfred the Great]]'s Anglo-Saxon translation of [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'', known as the ''[[Lays of Boethius]]''. Shippey contends that this Christian view of evil is most clearly stated by Boethius: "evil is nothing". He says Tolkien used the corollary that evil cannot create as the basis of [[Frodo]]'s remark, "the Shadow ... can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its own", and related remarks by [[Treebeard]] and [[Elrond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Shippey | first = Tom | year = 1983 | title = The Road to Middle-earth | pages = 140141 | isbn = 0-395-33973-1 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | location = Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to argue that in ''The Lord of the Rings'' evil does sometimes seem to be an independent force, more than merely the absence of good (though not independent to the point of the [[Manichaeism|Manichaean heresy]]), and suggests that Alfred's additions to his translation of Boethius may have inspired that view.&lt;ref&gt;''Road'', pp.&amp;nbsp;141145.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stratford Caldecott]] also interpreted the Ring in theological terms: "The Ring of Power exemplifies the dark magic of the corrupted will, the assertion of self in disobedience to God. It appears to give freedom, but its true function is to enslave the wearer to the Fallen Angel. It corrodes the human will of the wearer, rendering him increasingly 'thin' and unreal; indeed, its gift of invisibility symbolizes this ability to destroy all natural human relationships and identity. You could say the Ring is sin itself: tempting and seemingly harmless to begin with, increasingly hard to give up and corrupting in the long run."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Caldecott |first=Stratford |date=JanuaryFebruary 2002 |url=http://touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=15-01-051-f |title=The Lord &amp; Lady of the Rings |work=Touchstone Magazine |accessdate=27 March 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426033720/http://touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=15-01-051-f |archivedate=26 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===

====''Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics''====
{{Main|Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics}}
As well as his fiction, Tolkien was also a leading author of academic literary criticism. His seminal 1936 lecture, later published as an article, revolutionized the treatment of the Anglo-Saxon epic ''[[Beowulf]]'' by literary critics. The essay remains highly influential in the study of Old English literature to this day. ''Beowulf'' is one of the most significant influences upon Tolkien's later fiction, with major details of both ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' being adapted from the poem. The piece reveals many of the aspects of ''Beowulf'' which Tolkien found most inspiring, most prominently the role of monsters in literature, particularly that of the dragon which appears in the final third of the poem:{{quote|As for the poem, one dragon, however hot, does not make a summer, or a host; and a man might well exchange for one good dragon what he would not sell for a wilderness. And dragons, real dragons, essential both to the machinery and the ideas of a poem or tale, are actually rare.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, J. R. R. (1963). ''Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics''. Oxford. pp.&amp;nbsp;1011.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Children's books and other short works====
In addition to his [[mythopoeia|mythopoeic]] compositions, Tolkien enjoyed inventing fantasy stories to entertain his children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillip |first=Norman |year=2005 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-mag67.html |title=The Prevalence of Hobbits |work=The New York Times |accessdate=12 March 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411062440/http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-mag67.html |archivedate=11 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote annual Christmas letters from [[Father Christmas]] for them, building up a series of short stories (later compiled and published as ''[[The Father Christmas Letters]]''). Other works included ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'' and ''[[Roverandom]]'' (for children), and ''[[Leaf by Niggle]]'' (part of ''[[Tree and Leaf]]''), ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'', ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]'' and ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]''. ''Roverandom'' and ''Smith of Wootton Major'', like ''The Hobbit'', borrowed ideas from his ''legendarium''.

====''The Hobbit''====
Tolkien never expected his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident a book called ''[[The Hobbit]]'', which he had written some years before for his own children, came in 1936 to the attention of Susan Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm [[George Allen &amp; Unwin]], who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication.&lt;ref name="NYTimes obit"/&gt; When it was published a year later, the book attracted adult readers as well as children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel.

====''The Lord of the Rings''====
The request for a sequel prompted Tolkien to begin what would become his most famous work: the epic novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (originally published in three volumes 19541955). Tolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for ''The Lord of the Rings'', during which time he received the constant support of the [[Inklings]], in particular his closest friend [[C.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Lewis]], the author of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''. Both ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' are set against the background of ''The Silmarillion'', but in a time long after it.

Tolkien at first intended ''The Lord of the Rings'' to be a children's tale in the style of ''The Hobbit'', but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=5 June 1955 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-oxford.html |title=Oxford Calling |work=The New York Times |accessdate=12 March 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411062443/http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-oxford.html |archivedate=11 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though a direct sequel to ''The Hobbit'', it addressed an older audience, drawing on the immense [[backstory]] of [[Beleriand]] that Tolkien had constructed in previous years, and which eventually saw posthumous publication in ''The Silmarillion'' and other volumes. Tolkien's influence weighs heavily on the [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]] genre that grew up after the success of ''The Lord of the Rings''.

===Posthumous publications===

====''The Silmarillion''====
Tolkien wrote a brief "Sketch of the Mythology", which included the tales of Beren and Lthien and of Trin; and that sketch eventually evolved into the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', an epic history that Tolkien started three times but never published. Tolkien desperately hoped to publish it along with ''The Lord of the Rings'', but publishers (both [[Allen &amp; Unwin]] and [[HarperCollins|Collins]]) declined. Moreover, printing costs were very high in 1950s Britain, requiring ''The Lord of the Rings'' to be published in three volumes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond, Wayne G.]] (1993). ''J.R.R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography'', London: Saint Paul's Biographies, {{ISBN|1-873040-11-3}}, American edition {{ISBN|0-938768-42-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of this continuous redrafting is told in the posthumous series ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', edited by Tolkien's son, Christopher Tolkien. From around 1936, Tolkien began to extend this framework to include the tale of ''The Fall of [[Nmenor]]'', which was inspired by the legend of [[Atlantis]].

Tolkien had appointed his son Christopher to be his [[literary executor]], and he (with assistance from [[Guy Gavriel Kay]], later a well-known fantasy author in his own right) organized some of this material into a single coherent volume, published as ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' in 1977. It received the Locus Award for Best Fantasy novel in 1978.&lt;ref name="WWE-1978"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Unfinished Tales'' and ''The History of Middle-earth''====
In 1980 Christopher Tolkien published a collection of more fragmentary material, under the title ''[[Unfinished Tales|Unfinished Tales of Nmenor and Middle-earth]]''. In subsequent years (19831996) he published a large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''. They contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not complete consistency between ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'', the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing ''The Hobbit'' for a third edition, that he would have preferred to completely rewrite the book because of the style of its prose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Martinez |first=Michael|date=27 July 2002|url= http://www.merp.com/essays/MichaelMartinez/michaelmartinezsuite101essay122 |title=Middle-earth Revised, Again |work = Michael Martinez Tolkien Essays |accessdate =28 April 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080617122627/http://www.merp.com/essays/MichaelMartinez/michaelmartinezsuite101essay122 |archivedate = 17 June 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Mr. Bliss''====
One of Tolkien's least-known short works is the [[Children's literature|children's storybook]] ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'', published in 1982. It tells the story of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car. Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions. The story was inspired by Tolkien's own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in 1932. The bears were based on toy bears owned by Tolkien's sons. Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book. He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from him after the success of ''The Hobbit''. The lavish ink and coloured-pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive. Tolkien agreed to redraw the pictures in a simpler style, but then found he did not have time to do so. The book was published in 1982 as a facsimile of Tolkien's difficult-to-read illustrated manuscript, with a typeset transcription on each facing page.

====''The Children of Hrin''====
More recently, in 2007, ''[[The Children of Hrin]]'' was published by [[HarperCollins]] (in the UK and Canada) and [[Houghton Mifflin]] (in the US). The novel tells the story of [[Trin Turambar]] and his sister [[Nienor]], children of [[Hrin|Hrin Thalion]]. The material was compiled by Christopher Tolkien from ''The Silmarillion'', ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', and unpublished manuscripts.

====''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrn''====
''[[The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrn]]'', which was released worldwide on 5 May 2009 by HarperCollins and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, retells the legend of [[Sigurd]] and the fall of the [[Niflungs]] from Germanic mythology. It is a [[narrative poem]] composed in [[alliterative verse]] and is modelled after the [[Old Norse]] poetry of the [[Elder Edda]]. Christopher Tolkien supplied copious notes and commentary upon his father's work.

According to Christopher Tolkien, it is no longer possible to trace the exact date of the work's composition. On the basis of circumstantial evidence, he suggests that it dates from the 1930s. In his foreword he wrote, "He scarcely ever (to my knowledge) referred to them. For my part, I cannot recall any conversation with him on the subject until very near the end of his life, when he spoke of them to me, and tried unsuccessfully to find them."&lt;ref&gt;''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrn'', page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1967 letter to [[W. H. Auden]], Tolkien wrote,{{quote|Thank you for your wonderful effort in translating and reorganising ''[[Vlusp|The Song of the Sibyl]]''. In return again I hope to send you, if I can lay my hands on it (I hope it isn't lost), a thing I did many years ago when trying to learn the art of writing alliterative poetry: an attempt to unify the lays about the Vlsungs from the Elder Edda, written in the old eight-line [[fornyrislag]] stanza.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====''The Fall of Arthur''====
''[[The Fall of Arthur]]'', published on 23 May 2013, is a long narrative poem composed by Tolkien in the early-1930s. It is [[alliterative poem|alliterative]], extending to almost 1,000 lines imitating the [[Old English poetry|Old English]] ''[[Beowulf]]'' metre in Modern English.  Though inspired by high medieval Arthurian fiction, the historical setting of the poem is during the Post-Roman [[Migration Period]], both in form (using [[Germanic poetry|Germanic verse]]) and in content, showing Arthur as a [[Sub-Roman Britain|British]] [[warlord]] fighting the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain|Saxon invasion]], while it avoids the high medieval aspects of the Arthurian cycle (such as the Grail, and the courtly setting); the poem begins with a British "counter-invasion" to the [[Old Saxony|Saxon lands]] (''Arthur eastward in arms purposed'').&lt;ref&gt;announcing the 2013 edition, ''[[The Guardian]]'' on 9 October 2012 published the poem's first nine verses; Alison Flood, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/09/jrr-tolkien-new-poem-king-arthur 'New' JRR Tolkien epic due out next year] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202023157/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/09/jrr-tolkien-new-poem-king-arthur |date=2 December 2016 }} guardian.co.uk, Tuesday 9 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary''====
''[[Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary]]'', published on 22 May 2014, is a prose translation of the early medieval epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' from [[Old English]] to modern English. Translated by Tolkien from 1920 to 1926, it was edited by his son Christopher. The translation is followed by over 200 pages of commentary on the poem; this commentary was the basis of Tolkien's acclaimed 1936 lecture "Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-26662761 |title=JRR Tolkien's Beowulf translation to be published |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=20 March 2014 |accessdate=8 June 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415081413/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-26662761 |archivedate=15 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also includes the previously unpublished "Sellic Spell" and two versions of "The Lay of Beowulf". The former is a fantasy piece on Beowulf's biographical background, while the latter is a poem on the Beowulf theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-544-44278-8 |title=Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=26 May 2014 |accessdate=5 September 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905170548/http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-544-44278-8 |archivedate=5 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Story of Kullervo''====
''[[The Story of Kullervo]]'', first published in ''[[Tolkien Studies]]'' in 2010 and reissued with additional material in 2015, is a retelling of a 19th-century Finnish poem. It was written in 1915 while Tolkien was studying at Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Flood |first=Alison |date=12 August 2015 |title=JRR Tolkien's first fantasy story to be published this month |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/12/jrr-tolkiens-first-fantasy-story-to-be-published-this-month |newspaper=The Guardian |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202024432/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/12/jrr-tolkiens-first-fantasy-story-to-be-published-this-month |archivedate=2 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Beren and Lthien''====
''[[The Tale of Beren and Lthien]]'' is one of the oldest and most often revised in Tolkien's legendarium. The story is one of three contained within ''The Silmarillion'' which Tolkien believed to warrant their own long-form narratives. It was published as a standalone book, edited by Christopher Tolkien, under the title ''Beren and Lthien'' in 2017.&lt;ref name=edition2017&gt;{{Cite news|last=Flood |first=Alison |date=19 October 2016 |title=JRR Tolkien's Middle-earth love story to be published next year |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/19/jrr-tolkiens-middle-earth-love-story-published-beren-and-luthien |newspaper=The Guardian |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161209023052/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/19/jrr-tolkiens-middle-earth-love-story-published-beren-and-luthien |archivedate=9 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Fall of Gondolin]]'' is a tale of a beautiful, mysterious city destroyed by dark forces, that called "the first real story" of [[Middle-earth]], will be published in August 2018 as a standalone book, edited by Christopher Tolkien and illustrated by [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Flood |first=Alison |date=10 April 2018 |title=The Fall of Gondolin, 'new' JRR Tolkien book, to be published in 2018 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/10/the-fall-of-gondolin-new-jrr-tolkien-book-to-be-published-in-2018 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=13 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manuscript locations===
Before his death Tolkien negotiated the sale of the manuscripts, drafts, proofs and other materials related to his then-published worksincluding ''The Lord of the Rings'', ''The Hobbit'' and ''Farmer Giles of Ham''to the Department of Special Collections and University Archives at [[Marquette University]]'s John P.

==Languages and philology==

===Linguistic career===
Both Tolkien's academic career and his literary production are inseparable from his love of language and [[philology]]. He specialized in English philology at university and in 1915 graduated with [[Old Norse]] as his special subject.  He worked for the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] from 1918 and is credited with having worked on a number of words starting with the letter W, including [[walrus]], over which he struggled mightily.&lt;ref&gt;[[Winchester, Simon]] (2003). ''[[The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary]]''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-860702-4}}; and Gilliver, Peter, Jeremy Marshall and Edmund Weiner (2006). ''The Ring of Words: Tolkien and the Oxford English Dictionary''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-861069-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, he became Reader in English Language at the [[University of Leeds]], where he claimed credit for raising the number of students of [[linguistics]] from five to twenty. He gave courses in Old English [[heroic verse]], [[history of English]], various [[Old English]] and [[Middle English]] texts, Old and Middle English philology, introductory [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] philology, [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Old Icelandic]], and [[Middle Welsh language|Medieval Welsh]]. When in 1925, aged thirty-three, Tolkien applied for the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon at [[Pembroke College, Oxford]], he boasted that his students of Germanic philology in Leeds had even formed a "[[Viking revival|Viking Club]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 7, to the Electors of the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon, University of Oxford, 27 June 1925.&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a certain, if imperfect, knowledge of Finnish.&lt;ref&gt;Grotta, Daniel (2001). ''J.R.R. Tolkien: Architect of Middle Earth''. Philadelphia, Running Press. {{ISBN|0-7624-0956-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Privately, Tolkien was attracted to "things of [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] and linguistic significance", and in his 1955 lecture ''[[English and Welsh]]'', which is crucial to his understanding of race and language, he entertained notions of "inherent linguistic predilections", which he termed the "native language" as opposed to the "cradle-tongue" which a person first learns to speak.&lt;ref&gt;''English and Welsh'', O'Donnell Lecture, 1955, cited in [[Wayne G. Hammond]] &amp; [[Christina Scull]]: ''The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide: Reader's Guide'', London, HarperCollins 2006, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; He considered the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] dialect of Middle English to be his own "native language", and, as he wrote to [[W. H. Auden]] in 1955, "I am a West-midlander by blood (and took to early west-midland Middle English as a known tongue as soon as I set eyes on it)."&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language construction===
{{See also|Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien}}
[[File:Quenya Example.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.25|''Ah! like gold fall the leaves in the wind, long years numberless as the wings of trees!'', the beginning of the Quenya poem [[Namri]] written in [[Tengwar]] and in [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] script]]

Parallel to Tolkien's professional work as a philologist, and sometimes overshadowing this work, to the effect that his academic output remained rather thin, was his affection for [[constructed languages|constructing languages]]. The most developed of these are [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]], the etymological connection between which formed the core of much of Tolkien's ''legendarium''. Language and grammar for Tolkien was a matter of [[aesthetics]] and [[euphony]], and Quenya in particular was designed from "phonaesthetic" considerations; it was intended as an "Elvenlatin", and was phonologically based on Latin, with ingredients from Finnish, Welsh, English, and Greek.&lt;ref name="letter144"&gt;''Letters'', no. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; A notable addition came in late 1945 with [[Adnaic]] or [[Nmenrean]], a language of a "faintly [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] flavour", connected with Tolkien's [[Atlantis]] legend, which by ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'' ties directly into his ideas about the inability of language to be inherited, and via the "[[Second Age]]" and the story of [[Erendil]] was grounded in the ''legendarium'', thereby providing a link of Tolkien's 20th-century "real primary world" with the legendary past of his Middle-earth.

Tolkien considered languages inseparable from the mythology associated with them, and he consequently took a dim view of [[International auxiliary language|auxiliary languages]]: in 1930 a congress of Esperantists were told as much by him, in his lecture ''[[A Secret Vice]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.bl.uk/european/2018/01/tolkiens-secret-vice.html|title=Tolkien's 'Secret Vice'|last=Corsetti|first=Renato|date=31 January 2018|website=British Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Your language construction will breed a mythology", but by 1956 he had concluded that "[[Volapk]], [[Esperanto]], [[Ido (language)|Ido]], [[Novial]], &amp;c, &amp;c, are dead, far deader than ancient unused languages, because their authors never invented any Esperanto legends".&lt;ref name="letter180"&gt;''Letters'', no. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of Tolkien's books has had a small but lasting effect on the use of language in fantasy literature in particular, and even on mainstream dictionaries, which today commonly accept Tolkien's idiosyncratic spellings ''dwarves'' and ''dwarvish'' (alongside ''dwarfs'' and ''dwarfish''), which had been little used since the mid-19th century and earlier. (In fact, according to Tolkien, had the [[Old English]] plural survived, it would have been ''dwarrows'' or ''dwerrows''.) He also coined the term ''[[eucatastrophe]]'', though it remains mainly used in connection with his own work.

== Artwork ==
{{Expand section|date=May 2018}}
He was an accomplished artist, who learned to paint and draw as a child and continued to do so all his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.connexionfrance.com/Mag/Big-Picture/The-fine-art-of-weaving-a-Tolkien-tale|title=The fine art of weaving a Tolkien tale|last=France|first=Connexion|website=www.connexionfrance.com|access-date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From early in his writing career, the development of his stories was accompanied by drawings and paintings, especially of landscapes, and by maps of the lands in which the tales were set. He also produced pictures to accompany the stories told to his own children, including those later published in ''Mr Bliss'' and ''Roverandom'', and sent them elaborately illustrated letters purporting to come from Father Christmas. Although he regarded himself as an amateur, the publisher used the author's own cover art, maps, and full-page illustrations for the early editions of ''The Hobbit''. Much of his artwork was collected and published in 1995 as a book: ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator]]''. The book discusses the paintings, drawings, and sketches of J.R.R. Tolkien and in total includes 200 reproductions of his art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|oclc=33450124|title=[[J.R.R.

===Adaptations===
{{Main article|Works inspired by J. R. R. Tolkien}}

In a 1951 letter to Milton Waldman, Tolkien wrote about his intentions to create a "body of more or less connected legend", of which "[t]he cycles should be linked to a majestic whole, and yet leave scope for other minds and hands, wielding paint and music and drama".&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; The hands and minds of many artists have indeed been inspired by Tolkien's legends. Personally known to him were [[Pauline Baynes]] (Tolkien's favourite illustrator of ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' and ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'') and [[Donald Swann]] (who set the music to ''[[The Road Goes Ever On]]''). Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]] created illustrations to ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the early 1970s. She sent them to Tolkien, who was struck by the similarity they bore in style to his own drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thygesen |first=Peter |date=Autumn 1999 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-46949881.html |title=Queen Margrethe II: Denmark's monarch for a modern age |work=Scandinavian Review |accessdate=12 March 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227234252/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-46949881.html |archivedate=27 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Tolkien was not fond of all the artistic representation of his works that were produced in his lifetime, and was sometimes harshly disapproving. In 1946, he rejected suggestions for illustrations by Horus Engels for the German edition of ''The Hobbit'' as "too [[The Walt Disney Company|Disnified]] ... Bilbo with a dribbling nose, and [[Gandalf]] as a figure of vulgar fun rather than the [[Odin]]ic wanderer that I think of".&lt;ref&gt;''Letters'', no. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkien was sceptical of the emerging [[Tolkien fandom]] in the United States, and in 1954 he returned proposals for the dust jackets of the American edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'':
{{quote|Thank you for sending me the projected "blurbs", which I return. The Americans are not as a rule at all amenable to criticism or correction; but I think their effort is so poor that I feel constrained to make some effort to improve it.&lt;ref name="letter144"/&gt;}}

He had dismissed dramatic representations of fantasy in his essay "[[On Fairy-Stories]]", first presented in 1939:
{{quote|In human art Fantasy is a thing best left to words, to true literature. ... Drama is naturally hostile to Fantasy. Fantasy, even of the simplest kind, hardly ever succeeds in Drama, when that is presented as it should be, visibly and audibly acted.&lt;ref name="On Fairy-Stories"&gt;J. R. R. Tolkien, "On Fairy-Stories", in {{ME-ref|T&amp;L}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Film adaptations====
Tolkien scholar James Dunning coined the word ''Tollywood'', a portmanteau derived from "Tolkien Hollywood", to describe attempts to create a cinematographic adaptation of the stories in [[Tolkien's legendarium]] aimed at generating good [[Box office#Usage|box office]] results, rather than at fidelity to the idea of the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/1090-tollywood-and-the-hobbit-of-the-rings.php |title=Tollywood and The Hobbit of the Rings, Vol. I |publisher=Tolkienlibrary.com |accessdate=15 August 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826163033/http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/1090-tollywood-and-the-hobbit-of-the-rings.php |archivedate=26 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On receiving a screenplay for a proposed film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'' by Morton Grady Zimmerman, Tolkien wrote:

Tolkien went on to criticize the script scene by scene ("yet one more scene of screams and rather meaningless slashings"). He was not implacably opposed to the idea of a dramatic adaptation, however, and sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' to [[United Artists]] in 1968. United Artists never made a film, although director [[John Boorman]] was planning a live-action film in the early 1970s. In 1976, the rights were sold to [[Tolkien Enterprises]], a division of the [[Saul Zaentz]] Company, and the first film adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' was released in 1978 as an animated [[rotoscoping]] film directed by [[Ralph Bakshi]] with screenplay by the fantasy writer [[Peter S. Beagle]]. It covered only the first half of the story of ''The Lord of the Rings''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Canby |first=Vincent |date=15 November 1978 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-lordfilm.html |title=Film: 'The Lord of the Rings' From Ralph Bakshi |work=The New York Times |accessdate=12 March 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411062438/http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-lordfilm.html |archivedate=11 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, an [[animation|animated]] [[musical film|musical]] [[television film]] of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' was made by [[Rankin-Bass]], and in 1980, they produced the animated musical television film ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'', which covered some of the portions of ''The Lord of the Rings'' that Bakshi was unable to complete.

From 2001 to 2003, [[New Line Cinema]] released ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' as a trilogy of live-action films that were filmed in New Zealand and directed by [[Peter Jackson]].

In the field of taxonomy, over 80 taxa (genera and species) have been given scientific names honouring, or deriving from, characters or other fictional elements from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Hobbit]]'', and other works set in [[Middle-earth]].&lt;ref name=Larsen&gt;{{harvnb|Larsen|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several taxa have been named after the character [[Gollum]] (also known as Smagol), as well as for various [[hobbit]]s, the small humanlike creatures such as [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and [[Frodo Baggins]]. Various [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elves]], [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarves]], and other creatures that appear in his writings as well as Tolkien himself have been honoured in the names of several species, including the amphipod ''[[Leucothoe (amphipod)|Leucothoe tolkieni]]'', and the wasp ''[[Shireplitis|Shireplitis tolkieni]]''.

There are seven [[blue plaque]]s in England that commemorate places associated with Tolkien: one in Oxford, one in Bournemouth, four in Birmingham and one in Leeds. One of the Birmingham plaques commemorates the inspiration provided by Sarehole Mill, near which he lived between the ages of four and eight, while two mark childhood homes up to the time he left to attend Oxford University and the other marks a hotel he stayed at before leaving for France during World War I. The plaque in West Park, Leeds, commemorates the five years Tolkien enjoyed at Leeds as Reader and then Professor of English Language at the University. The Oxford plaque commemorates the residence where Tolkien wrote ''The Hobbit'' and most of ''The Lord of the Rings''.

===Autographs===
[[File:JRR Tolkien signature - from Commons.svg|thumb|Tolkien rarely signed his works, and his autograph has become highly valued by collectors.]]
Unlike other authors of the genre, Tolkien never favoured signing his works. Owing to his popularity, handsigned copies of his letters or of the first editions of his individual writings have however achieved high values at auctions, and forged autographs may occur on the market. In particular, the signed first hardback edition of ''The Hobbit'' from 1937 has reportedly been offered for $85,000. Collectibles also include non-fiction books with hand-written annotations from Tolkien's private library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eHAyr784pREC&amp;pg=PA163 |title=The Essential J.R.R.
