==Early life==
Murphy was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]],&lt;ref name=filmref /&gt; and raised in the borough's [[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Bushwick]] neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120711010347/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JtAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SzoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6872,5299502]&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Lillian (Laney), was a telephone operator, and his father, Charles Edward Murphy, was a transit police officer and an amateur actor and comedian.&lt;ref name=filmref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/23/Eddie-Murphy.html |title=Eddie Murphy Biography (1961) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="actors"&gt;Stated in interview on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nymag&gt;{{cite news|last=Flippo|first=Chet|title=Eddie Murphy Live: The razor-edged king of late night comedy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j-ICAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=eddie%20murphy%20new%20york%20magazine%20oct.%2011%201982&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=June 27, 2011|newspaper=New York |date=October 11, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800011536/bio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109153556/http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800011536/bio|date=November 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/ns/charlie-murphy-obituary/185062644|title=Charlie Murphy Obituary on Legacy.com|website=Legacy.com|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Murphy's single mother became ill, the eight-year-old Murphy and his older brother [[Charlie Murphy|Charlie]] lived in [[foster care]] for one year. In interviews, Murphy has said that his time in foster care was influential in developing his sense of humor. Later, he and his brother were raised in [[Roosevelt, New York]], by his mother and stepfather Vernon Lynch, a foreman at an ice cream plant.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt;

Around the age of 15, Murphy was writing and performing his own routines, which were heavily influenced by [[Bill Cosby]] and [[Richard Pryor]].&lt;ref name="actors" /&gt;

==Career==

===Stand-up comedy===
His early comedy was characterized by frequent swearing and sketches lampooning a diverse group of people (including [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]]s (WASPs), [[African American]]s, [[Italian American]]s, [[Obesity|overweight people]], and [[LGBT community|gay people]]). Murphy released two stand-up specials. ''[[Eddie Murphy (album)|Eddie Murphy]]'' was his first album, released in 1982.  ''[[Eddie Murphy Delirious|Delirious]]'' was filmed in 1983 in [[Washington, D.C.]] Due to the popularity of ''Delirious'', his concert film ''[[Eddie Murphy Raw]]'' (1987) received a wide theatrical release, grossing $50 million; the movie was filmed in the [[The Theater at Madison Square Garden|Felt Forum]] section of [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|title=Eddie Murphy Delirious|id=0085474|accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|title=Eddie Murphy Raw|id=0092948|accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy has said his comedic influences include [[Bill Cosby]],&lt;ref name="actors" /&gt; [[Richard Pryor]],&lt;ref name="actors" /&gt; [[Redd Foxx]],&lt;ref name="actors" /&gt; and [[Robin Williams]].&lt;ref name="actors" /&gt;

Comedians who in turn cite Murphy has having influenced them include [[Russell Brand]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.accesshollywood.com/russell-brand-how-has-eddie-murphy-influenced-him-as-a-comic_video_1423233 | title = Russell Brand: How Has Eddie Murphy Influenced Him As A Comic?}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dave Chappelle]],&lt;ref name="InsideActorsStudio"&gt;{{cite episode|title = Dave Chappelle|series = Inside the Actors Studio|serieslink = Inside the Actors Studio|network = [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]]|airdate = February 12, 2006|season = 12|number = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chris Rock]].&lt;ref name="RockBTP1996"&gt;{{cite video| title = [[Chris Rock: Bring the Pain]]| medium = TV| publisher = [[HBO]]|date = 1996}}{{Page needed|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s acting career===
[[File:EddieMurphy1988.jpg|thumb|upright|Murphy in 1988]]
Murphy first earned national attention as a cast member on ''Saturday Night Live'' (SNL) and was credited with helping to revitalize the show during the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Tom |last=Shales |title=Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live |publisher=Back Bay |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ySMXLky50NkC |year=2003 |isbn=0-316-73565-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His notable characters included a grown-up version of the ''[[Little Rascals]]'' character [[Billie Thomas|Buckwheat]];&lt;ref name=buckwheat&gt;{{Cite book|first=Tom |last=Shales |title=Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live |publisher=Back Bay |year=2003 |ISBN=0-316-73565-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ySMXLky50NkC |page=549}}&lt;/ref&gt; a street-wise children's show host named Mr. Robinson (a spoof of [[Fred Rogers]], who found it amusing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Tom |last=Shales |title=Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live |publisher=Back Bay |year=2003 |isbn=0-316-73565-5 |page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;); and a morose, cynical ''[[Gumby]]'', whose trademark slogan became an SNL catchphrase: "I'm Gumby, dammit!"&lt;ref name=buckwheat/&gt;

The Buckwheat character was retired in spectacular fashionassassinated, on camera, in front of [[30 Rockefeller Plaza]]at Murphy's request, after he grew tired of constant demands from fans to "Do Buckwheat! Do Buckwheat!"&lt;ref name=SNL-Backstage&gt;{{IMDb title| title=Saturday Night Live Backstage| id=tt1899280| accessdate=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|title="Saturday Night Live" March 12, 1983, NBC| id=tt0694998 | accessdate=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s February 2015 appraisal of all 141 SNL cast members to date, Murphy was ranked second (behind [[John Belushi]]).  "It is customary (and accurate) to say that Eddie Murphy is the only reason SNL survived the five-year wilderness without [[Lorne Michaels]]," they noted.&lt;ref&gt;''Rolling Stone'', issue 1229, February 26, 2015, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Murphy made his big screen debut in the film ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' with [[Nick Nolte]].&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; ''48 Hrs.'' proved to be a hit when it was released in the Christmas season of 1982. Nolte was scheduled to host the December 11, 1982, Christmas episode of ''Saturday Night Live'', but became too ill to host, so Murphy took over. He became the only cast member to host while still a regular. Murphy opened the show with the phrase, "Live from New York, It's the Eddie Murphy Show!" 

The following year, Murphy starred in ''[[Trading Places]]'' with fellow ''SNL'' alumnus [[Dan Aykroyd]].&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; The movie marked the first of Murphy's collaborations with director [[John Landis]] (who also directed Murphy in ''[[Coming to America]]'' and ''[[Beverly Hills Cop III]]'') and proved to be an even greater box office success than ''48 Hrs.'' 

In 1984, Murphy appeared in ''[[Best Defense]]'', co-starring [[Dudley Moore]]. Murphy, who was credited as a "Strategic Guest Star", was added to the film after an original version was completed but tested poorly with audiences. ''Best Defense'' was a major financial and critical disappointment. When he hosted ''SNL'', Murphy joined the chorus of those bashing ''Best Defense'', calling it "the worst movie in the history of everything".  Aykroyd originally wrote the [[Winston Zeddemore]] character in ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' specifically for Murphy, but he was unable to commit at the time due to the ''Beverly Hills Cop'' shooting schedule.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}  The part ultimately went to [[Ernie Hudson]].

Later in 1984, Murphy starred in the successful action comedy film ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]''.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; The film was Murphy's first solo leading role.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; ''Beverly Hills Cop'' grossed over $230&amp;nbsp;million at the U.S. box office becoming the highest grossing film released in 1984, the highest grossing comedy of all-time and the highest grossing "R" rated film of all-time and {{As of|2018|May|lc=on}} it was 46th in the list of all-time U.S. box office grossers after adjusting for inflation (3rd-highest amongst "R" rated films).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm |title=Domestic Grosses Adjusted for Ticket Price Inflation |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy was also offered a part in 1986's ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'', a role that, after being heavily re-written from comic relief to love interest, ultimately went to future ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'' star [[Catherine Hicks]]. By this point&lt;ref&gt;according to the autobiography of the film's director and co-star, [[Leonard Nimoy]].&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy's near-exclusive contract with [[Paramount Pictures]] rivaled ''Star Trek'' as Paramount's most lucrative franchise.

In 1986, Murphy starred in the [[supernatural]] comedy, ''[[The Golden Child]]''.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; Although ''The Golden Child'' performed well at the box office, the movie was not as critically acclaimed as ''48 Hrs.'', ''Trading Places'', and ''Beverly Hills Cop''. ''The Golden Child'' was considered a change of pace for Murphy because of the supernatural setting as opposed to the more "street smart" settings of Murphy's previous efforts.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} A year later, Murphy reprised his role of Axel Foley in the [[Tony Scott]]-directed ''[[Beverly Hills Cop II]]''. It was a box-office success, grossing almost $300&amp;nbsp;million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=beverlyhillscop2.htm|title=Beverly Hills Cop II (1987)|publisher=Box Office Mojo|date=|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singing career===
Murphy is also a singer, having frequently provided background vocals to songs released by [[The Bus Boys]]; the song "(The Boys Are) Back in Town" was featured in ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' and Murphy's comedy special ''[[Eddie Murphy Delirious]]''. As a solo artist, Murphy had two hit singles, "[[Party All the Time]]" (which was produced by [[Rick James]]) and "Put Your Mouth On Me" during the latter half of the 1980s. He had started singing earlier in his career, with the songs "Boogie in Your Butt" and "Enough Is Enough", the latter being a parody of [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Donna Summer]]'s 1979 song, "[[No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)|No More Tears]]" (They both appear on his 1982 self-titled comedy album.)

"Party All the Time" was featured on Murphy's 1985 debut album ''[[How Could It Be]]'', which included a minor follow-up [[R&amp;B]] hit in the title track, a duet with vocalist Crystal Blake. This track was written by Rusty Hamilton and was produced by [[Stevie Wonder]]'s cousin Aquil Fudge after a brief falling out with Rick James. In 2004, [[VH-1]] and ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' voted "Party All the Time" number seven among the "50 Worst Songs of All-Time." [[Sharam Tayebi|Sharam]] used a [[Sampling (music)|sample]] of the song for the UK #8 hit "PATT (Party All The Time)" in 2006.  "Put Your Mouth on Me" appeared on Murphy's 1989 follow-up album, ''[[So Happy]]''.

Murphy recorded the album ''[[Love's Alright]]'' in the early 1990s. He performed in a music video of the single "[[Whatzupwitu]]", featuring [[Michael Jackson]]. He recorded a duet with [[Shabba Ranks]] called "I Was a King". In 1992, Murphy appeared in Michael Jackson's "[[Remember the Time]]" alongside [[Magic Johnson]] and [[Iman Abdulmajid|Iman]].

Though uncredited, Murphy provided vocal work on ''SNL'' castmate [[Joe Piscopo]]'s comedy single, "The Honeymooners Rap."{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Piscopo impersonated [[Jackie Gleason]] on the single, while Murphy provided an imitation of [[Art Carney]].

In ''[[Coming to America]]'', he imitated [[Jackie Wilson]] when he sang "To Be Loved", but because the character he was playing had a thick accent, he had to sing it in character. In later years, Murphy performed several songs in the [[Shrek (film series)|''Shrek'' film franchise]]. In the first film, he performed a version of "[[I'm a Believer]]" in the film's final scene; in ''[[Shrek 2]]'' he performed [[Ricky Martin]]'s hit "[[Livin' La Vida Loca]]" along with co-star [[Antonio Banderas]]; Murphy performed [[Thank You (Falletin Me Be Mice Elf Again)]] for [[Shrek the Third]], once again with Banderas.

In 2013 he released his first single in years titled "Red Light", a [[reggae]] song featuring [[Snoop Lion]]. He is also working on a new album titled ''9''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.vibe.com/article/new-music-eddie-murphy-feat-snoop-lion-%E2%80%98red-light%E2%80%99 |title=New Music: Eddie Murphy Feat.

===1990s career===

From 1989 and through most of the early 1990s, box office results and reviews for Murphy's films were strong, but by 1992 both declined, hitting a low point with the critically panned ''[[Beverly Hills Cop III]]'' (1994),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beverly Hills Cop 3 (1994) |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beverly_hills_cop_3/ |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes}}&lt;/ref&gt; a movie Murphy would ultimately denounce during an appearance on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'',&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; although he did find box office success with ''[[Boomerang (1992 film)|Boomerang]]'' and ''[[Another 48 Hrs.]]'' ''[[Harlem Nights]]'' featured Murphy, who had previously been known only as a performer, as director, producer, star, and co-writer, with his brother, [[Charlie Murphy]], as well as supporting roles for Murphy's comic idols [[Redd Foxx]] and [[Richard Pryor]].&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt;

During this period, Murphy was criticized by filmmaker [[Spike Lee]] for not using his show business stature to help black actors break into film,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=March 6, 1989|title=Spike Lee Challenges Black Show Biz Figures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1r0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA57&amp;lpg=RA1-PA57&amp;dq=should+use+his+clout+rather+than+focus+on+who+gets+the+best+table+at+Spago#v=onepage&amp;q=should%20use%20his%20clout%20rather%20than%20focus%20on%20who%20gets%20the%20best%20table%20at%20Spago&amp;f=false|journal=JET|volume=|pages=57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as Murphy's prominence grew, his films (especially those he produced) were often populated with predominantly black casts (''[[Coming to America]]'', ''Harlem Nights'', ''Boomerang'', ''[[Vampire in Brooklyn]]'', ''[[Life (1999 film)|Life]]''). Many black actors who would later gain wider recognition make early appearances in Murphy films, such as [[Damon Wayans]] in ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'', [[Halle Berry]] and [[Martin Lawrence]] in ''Boomerang'', [[Samuel L. Jackson]] and [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] in ''Coming to America'', [[Dave Chappelle]] in ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'', and [[Chris Rock]] in ''[[Beverly Hills Cop II]]''.

Although Murphy has enjoyed commercial success since ''Saturday Night Live'', he did not participate in the making of the ''Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live'' retrospective book by [[Tom Shales]] and James Andrew Miller (2002), nor did he ever attend cast reunions or anniversary specials until his appearance on the [[Saturday Night Live (season 40)#Specials|''SNL'' 40th anniversary special]]. Murphy's box office results began to recover in 1996, starting with ''The Nutty Professor''.

===1998 to present===
He followed with a series of very successful family-friendly movies like ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'', ''[[Dr. Dolittle (film)|Dr. Dolittle]]'', and [[Dr. Dolittle 2|its sequel]], the ''[[Shrek (franchise)|Shrek]]'' series, ''[[Daddy Day Care]]'', and ''[[The Haunted Mansion (film)|The Haunted Mansion]]'', along with ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]''. However, most of his movies meant for more adult audiences performed moderately; ''[[Metro (1997 film)|Metro]]'', ''[[I Spy (film)|I Spy]]'', and ''[[Showtime (film)|Showtime]]'' all grossed less than $40&amp;nbsp;million domestically, ''[[Holy Man]]'' performed poorly, grossing less than $13&amp;nbsp;million, and ''[[The Adventures of Pluto Nash]]'' is on record as one of the biggest theatrical money-losers of all time, grossing just $7&amp;nbsp;million worldwide on a reported $110&amp;nbsp;million budget. A notable exception to this run of poorly received adult-themed films was the [[Frank Oz]] comedy ''[[Bowfinger]]'', also starring [[Steve Martin]]. The film garnered generally positive critical reviews and grossed $98&amp;nbsp;million at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bowfinger.htm |title=boxofficemojo.com: Bowfinger (1999) |publisher=boxofficemojo.com |date=June 19, 2007 |accessdate=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, he starred in the motion picture version of the [[Broadway musical]] ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'' as soul singer James "Thunder" Early. Murphy won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture|Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor]], as well as a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] and a [[Broadcast Film Critics Association]] Award in that category. Several reviews for the film highlighted Murphy's performance while he received some pre-release [[Academy Awards]] buzz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/movies/03modd.html?_r=1&amp;ref%3Dmovies&amp;oref=slogin|title=Eddie Murphy Inspires Oscar Buzz.

Murphy was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for Best Supporting Actor on January 23, 2007, but lost to [[Alan Arkin]] for his performance in ''[[Little Miss Sunshine]]''  there was a suggestion that one of the reasons Murphy lost out on winning the Academy Award were the negative reviews of his subsequent film ''[[Norbit]]'', released in early February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Is this what a future Oscar winner looks like? |author=Greg Braxton |author2=Robert W.

''Dreamgirls'' was the first film distributed by Paramount Pictures to star Murphy (who once was on an exclusive contract with the studio) since ''[[Vampire in Brooklyn]]'' in 1995.

In 2007, Murphy was invited to join the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=entertainment&amp;id=5400194 |title=abc7.com: Film Academy Invites 115 New Members 6/19/07 |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=June 19, 2007 |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221030429/http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=entertainment&amp;id=5400194 |archivedate=February 21, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of [[Viacom]]'s acquisition of [[DreamWorks]], Paramount distributed his other 2007 releases: ''[[Norbit]]'' and ''[[Shrek the Third]]''. He starred in the 2008 film ''[[Meet Dave]]'', and the 2009 film ''[[Imagine That (film)|Imagine That]]'' for Paramount Pictures.

Murphy co-starred in ''[[Tower Heist]]'', directed by [[Brett Ratner]]. Murphy played a thief who joins a group of hardworking men who find out they have fallen victim to a wealthy businessman's [[Ponzi scheme]], and conspire to rob his high-rise residence. [[Ben Stiller]], [[Matthew Broderick]], and [[Casey Affleck]] also starred in the film, released on November 4, 2011.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2010/11/16/tower-heist-continues-filming-at-trump-international-hotel-tower |title='Tower Heist' continues filming at Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower |publisher=On Location Vacations |date= |accessdate=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was reported in 2011 that Murphy would host the [[84th Academy Awards]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barnes|first1=Henry|title=Eddie Murphy confirmed as Oscars 2012 host|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/07/eddie-murphy-confirmed-oscars-host|website=theguardian.com|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he dropped out of his hosting duties on November 9, 2011, in the wake of the [[Brett Ratner#Academy Awards|Brett Ratner scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eddie Murphy drops out as Oscars host|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/09/showbiz/oscars-murphy/index.html|website=cnn.com|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brett Ratner]] will direct the film, [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] is confirmed to produce the film, and [[Josh Appelbaum]] and [[Andre Nemec]] will write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/12/jerry-bruckheimer-paramount-producer-deal/|title=UPDATE: Jerry Bruckheimer And Paramount Ink First-Look Deal; Brett Ratner Attached To Direct Beverly Hills Cop|last=Busch|first=Anita|date=December 6, 2013|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a June 2014 interview, Murphy discussed the plot of the film stating that it would take place in Detroit and they would actually film in Detroit bringing in an estimated $56.6 million to the state of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reed |first=Ryan |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/eddie-murphy-will-be-back-in-detroit-for-beverly-hills-cop-4-20140627 |title=Eddie Murphy Will Be Back in Detroit for 'Beverly Hills Cop 4' |work=Rolling Stone |date=June 27, 2014 |accessdate=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 14, 2016, it was confirmed that Murphy was still set to reprise his role as [[Axel Foley]] in a fourth film of the [[Beverly Hills Cop (franchise)|''Beverly Hills Cop'' franchise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McNary|first=Dave|title=Eddie Murphy's 'Beverly Hills Cop 4' Finds Directors|date=June 14, 2016|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/beverly-hills-cop-4-directors-eddie-murphy-1201795498/|accessdate=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike, Jr. |title=Beverly Hills Cop Lands Adil El Arbi &amp; Bilall Fallah To Direct Eddie Murphy|date=June 14, 2016|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|url=http://deadline.com/2016/06/beverly-hills-cop-sequel-adil-el-arbi-bilall-fallah-directing-eddie-murphy-jerry-bruckheimer-paramount-1201772591/|accessdate=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy began a longtime romantic relationship with Nicole Mitchell after meeting her in 1988 at an [[NAACP Image Awards]] show. They lived together for almost two years before getting married at the Grand Ballroom of [[The Plaza Hotel]] in New York City on March 18, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/film/2005/08/08/eddiemurphy/|title=Eddie Murphy and wife divorce after 12 years|work=Hello!|date=August 8, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy and Mitchell had five children together: Bria&lt;!--L.

Following his divorce from Mitchell, in 2006, Murphy began dating former [[Spice Girls|Spice Girl]] [[Mel B|Melanie Brown]], who became pregnant and stated that the child was Murphy's. When questioned about the pregnancy in December 2006, by ''[[RTL Boulevard]]'', Murphy told [[Dutch people|Dutch]] reporter [[Matthijs Kleyn]], "I don't know whose child that is until it comes out and has a blood test. You shouldn't jump to conclusions, sir". Brown gave birth to a baby girl, Angel Iris Murphy Brown, on Murphy's 46th birthday, April 3, 2007. On June 22, 2007, representatives for Brown announced in ''[[People magazine|People]]'' that a [[DNA]] test had confirmed that Murphy was the father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20043487,00.html|title=Mel B Says DNA Proves Eddie Murphy Fathered Her Baby|work=People }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown had stated in an interview that Murphy has not sought a relationship with Angel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/a101281/mel-b-writes-song-about-eddie-murphy.html |title=Mel B writes song about Eddie Murphy |publisher=Digital Spy |date=June 17, 2008 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/ent/celeb/articles/2011/11/03/20111103eddie-murphy-hasnt-had-drink-18-years.html |title=Eddie Murphy hasn't had a drink in 18 years |publisher=AZCentral.com |date=November 3, 2011|accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it was later reported in 2010 that Murphy was getting to know her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/source-eddie-murphy-making-effort-daughter-ex-flame-melanie-brown-article-1.445721 |title=Source says Eddie Murphy making effort to get to know daughter he had with ex-flame Melanie Brown |publisher=NY Daily News |date=May 10, 2010 |accessdate=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuit===

In 1988, [[Art Buchwald]] sued Murphy and Paramount Pictures, alleging that they had used ideas from a screenplay he had submitted to Paramount as the basis for Murphy's film ''[[Coming to America]]''.  In 1992, Buchwald was awarded $150,000 in a summary judgment; Buchwald's producing partner, Alan Bernheim, was awarded $750,000.  Both sides described the outcome as a "victory".&lt;ref&gt;Art Buchwald Awarded $150,000 in Suit Over Film (March 17, 1992).
