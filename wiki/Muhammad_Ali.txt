'''Muhammad Ali''' ({{IPAc-en|||l|i}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ali |title=Ali|work=[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; born '''Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr.''';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/boxing/2016/07/11/muhammad-ali-name-change-cassius-clay/86956544/|title=Why Muhammad Ali never legally changed name from Cassius Clay|access-date=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; January 17, 1942  June 3, 2016) was an American [[professional boxer]], [[activist]] and [[philanthropist]]. He is widely regarded as one of the most significant and celebrated sports figures of the 20th century. From early in his career, Ali was known as an inspiring, controversial, and polarizing figure both inside and outside the ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history1900s.about.com/od/people/a/muhammadali_2.htm |title=Muhammad Ali  Biography of Muhammad Ali  Page 2 |publisher=History1900s.about.com |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cagle|first=Jess|title=Ali: Lord of the Ring|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1001498,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=December 17, 2001|accessdate=September 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born and raised in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], and began training as an [[amateur boxer]] when he was 12 years old. At age 18, he won a gold medal in the [[light heavyweight]] division at the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in Rome and turned professional later that year. At age 22 in 1964, he won the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]], [[World Boxing Council|WBC]], and [[List of lineal boxing world champions#Heavyweight|lineal heavyweight]] titles from [[Sonny Liston]] in [[Muhammad Ali vs. Sonny Liston|a major upset]]. He then announced his conversion to [[Islam]] and changed his name from Cassius Clay, which he called his "[[slave name]]", to Muhammad Ali. He set an example of racial pride for [[African Americans]] and resistance to white domination during the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref name="HauserThomas"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hauser|first1=Thomas|title=The Importance of Muhammad Ali|url=http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/civil-rights-movement/essays/importance-muhammad-ali|website=Gilder Lehrman Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hollowverse"&gt;{{cite web|title=The religion and politics of Muhammad Ali|url=http://hollowverse.com/muhammad-ali/|website=Hollowverse|publisher=MK Safi|accessdate=June 4, 2016|ref=hollowverse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, two years after winning the heavyweight title, Ali further antagonized the white establishment by refusing to be [[conscripted|drafted]] into the U.S. military, citing his religious beliefs and opposition to American involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="HauserThomas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Randy|title=Winning is the Only Thing: Sports in America Since 1945|date=1991|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|pages=171172}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was eventually arrested, found guilty of draft evasion charges, and stripped of his boxing titles. He successfully [[Clay v. United States|appealed]] the decision to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], which overturned his conviction in 1971, by which time he had not fought for nearly four years and thereby lost a period of peak performance as an athlete. Ali's actions as a [[conscientious objector]] to the war made him an icon for the larger [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hallett |first=Alison |url=http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/not-so-fast/Content?oid=10883366 |title=Not So Fast |newspaper=Portland Mercury |accessdate=December 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/sports/in-alis-voice-from-the-past-a-stand-for-the-ages.html | work=The New York Times | first=William C. | last=Rhoden | title=In Ali's Voice From the Past, a Stand for the Ages | date=June 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali was one of the leading heavyweight boxers of the 20th century, and remains the only three-time [[lineal championship|lineal]] heavyweight champion. His records of beating 21 boxers for the world heavyweight title (shared with [[Joe Louis]]), as well as winning 14 unified title bouts (shared with former welterweight champion [[Jos Napoles]]), were unbeaten for 35 years. Ali is the only boxer to be named [[The Ring magazine Fighter of the Year|''The Ring'' magazine Fighter of the Year]] six times. He was ranked the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time by ''[[Ring Magazine]]''&lt;ref name="ring"/&gt; and [[The Associated Press]],&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt; and the second greatest [[pound-for-pound]] boxer by [[ESPN]].&lt;ref name="espn"/&gt; He was also ranked as the greatest athlete of the 20th century by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', the [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year#Sports Personality of the Century Award|Sports Personality of the Century]] by the BBC, and the third greatest athlete of the 20th century by [[ESPN]] ''[[SportsCentury]]''. Nicknamed "the Greatest", he was involved in several historic boxing matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://espn.go.com/sports/boxing/topics/_/page/muhammad-ali | work=ESPN | title=Muhammad Ali | date=January 20, 2012 | accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable among these were the [[Muhammad Ali vs. Sonny Liston|Liston fights]]; the "[[Fight of the Century]]", "[[Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier II|Super Fight II]]" and the "[[Thrilla in Manila]]" against his rival [[Joe Frazier]]; and "[[The Rumble in the Jungle]]" against [[George Foreman]]. Ali drew record global [[List of most watched television broadcasts|television audiences]], including 1{{nbsp}}billion viewers for "The Rumble in the Jungle" (1974)&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt; and "Thrilla in Manila" (1975),&lt;ref name="boxingnews24"/&gt; and 2{{nbsp}}billion for [[Leon Spinks vs. Muhammad Ali II|Ali{{ndash}}Spinks II]] (1978)&lt;ref name="Riccella"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Detroit"/&gt; and "[[Muhammad Ali vs. Larry Holmes|The Last Hurrah]]" (1980).&lt;ref name="nevada"/&gt;

At a time when most fighters let their managers do the talking, Ali thrived in and indeed craved the spotlight, where he was often provocative and outlandish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTr-p-Y4P00 |title=Muhammad Ali  press conference 1974 |website=YouTube |date=September 26, 2012 |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwPPM_vaNrI |title=Muhammad Ali  Pre Liston Poetry &amp; Highlights |publisher=YouTube |date=February 12, 2011 |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6Hey54O6Qs |title=Muhammad Ali Famous Interview After Defeating Foreman |website=YouTube |date=January 6, 2010 |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was known for [[trash talking]], and often [[Freestyle rap|freestyled]] with [[rhyme scheme]]s and spoken word [[poetry]], both for his trash talking in boxing and as political poetry for his activism, anticipating elements of [[rap]] and [[hip hop music]].&lt;ref name="nytimes2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rollingstone1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rollingstone2"/&gt; As a musician, Ali recorded two [[spoken word]] albums and a [[rhythm and blues]] song, and received two [[Grammy Award]] nominations.&lt;ref name="rollingstone2"/&gt; As an actor, he performed in several films and a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical. Additionally, Ali wrote two autobiographies, one during and one after his boxing career.

As a [[Muslim]], Ali was initially affiliated with [[Elijah Muhammad]]'s [[Nation of Islam]] (NOI) and advocated their [[Black separatism|black separatist]] ideology. He later disavowed the NOI, adhering to [[Sunni Islam]], practicing [[Sufism]], and supporting [[racial integration]], like his former mentor [[Malcolm X]].

After retiring from boxing at age 39 in 1981, Ali focused on religion and charity. His efforts in [[philanthropy]] and [[humanitarianism]] include campaigning for various causes, donating millions to charity organizations and disadvantaged people, and helping to feed more than 22{{nbsp}}million people afflicted by hunger.&lt;ref name="Christopher"/&gt; In 1984 Ali was diagnosed with [[Parkinsonism|Parkinson's syndrome]], which his doctors attributed to boxing-related brain injuries.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} As his condition worsened, Ali made limited public appearances and was cared for by his family until his death on June 3, 2016, in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]].

==Early life and amateur career==
Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. ({{IPAc-en||k||||s}}) was born on January 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky.&lt;ref name="greatath"/&gt; He had a sister and four brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Barber Can Relax Hair |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB32F2545452CEB&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |work=Philadelphia Inquirer |date=October 15, 1997 |accessdate=September 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;{{cite news |title=Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr., Former Champion's Father, 77 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDA1230F933A25751C0A966958260 |agency=Associated Press |work=The New York Times |date=February 10, 1990 |accessdate=September 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named for his father, [[Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr.]] (19121990), who himself was named in honor of the 19th-century [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politician and staunch [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], [[Cassius Marcellus Clay (politician)|Cassius Marcellus Clay]], also from the state of [[Kentucky]]. Clay's father's paternal grandparents were John Clay and Sallie Anne Clay; Clay's sister Eva claimed that Sallie was a native of Madagascar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Egerton |first=John|authorlink=John Egerton (journalist)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O6YFLYjAgcQC&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;pg=PA134#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Shades of Gray: Dispatches from the Modern South|publisher=[[LSU Press]] |date=September 1, 1991 |ISBN = 0807117056|page=134|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a descendant of slaves of the [[antebellum South]], and was predominantly of [[Africans|African]] descent, with smaller amounts of [[Irish people|Irish]]&lt;ref name="Great-grandfather emigrated from Ennis, County Clare, Ireland"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36452554 | title=Muhammad Ali: Boxer's ancestral Irish town pays tribute after death | publisher=BBC | date=June 4, 2016 | accessdate=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[English people|English]] heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/boxing/1810535.stm |title=Ali has Irish ancestry |publisher=BBC News |date=February 9, 2002 |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rietwiesner|first=Williams Adams|title=Ancestry of Muhammad Ali|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/ali.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father painted billboards and signs,&lt;ref name="greatath"&gt;{{cite book| last = Johnson| first = Rafer| title = Great Athletes| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TnIAPwAACAAJ| edition = revised| volume = 1| date = February 1, 2002| publisher = Salem Press| isbn = 978-1-58765-008-6| pages = 3841 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother, [[Odessa Grady Clay|Odessa O'Grady Clay]] (19171994), was a domestic helper. Although Cassius Sr. was a Methodist, he allowed Odessa to bring up both Cassius Jr. and his younger brother [[Rahman Ali|Rudolph "Rudy" Clay]] (later renamed Rahman Ali) as Baptists.&lt;ref name="Hauser 2004 p14"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hauser|2004|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cassius Jr. attended [[Central High School (Louisville, Kentucky)|Central High School]] in Louisville.

Clay grew up amid [[racial segregation]]. His mother recalled one occasion when he was denied a drink of water at a store"They wouldn't give him one [[Racism in the United States#African Americans|because of his color]]. That really affected him."&lt;ref name="HauserThomas"/&gt; He was also affected by the 1955 murder of [[Emmett Till]], which led to young Clay and a friend's taking out their frustration by vandalizing a local railyard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hampton |first1=Henry |authorlink1=Henry Hampton |last2=Fayer |first2=Steve |last3=Flynn |first3=Sarah |date=1990|title=Voices of Freedom: An Oral History of the Civil Rights Movement from the 1950s through the 1980s|page= 321|publisher= [[Bantam Books]]|isbn= 978-0-553-05734-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gorn, Elliott |date=1998|title=Muhammad Ali: The People's Champ|pages= 7677|publisher= University of Illinois Press|isbn= 978-0-252-06721-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boxing light-heavyweight 1960 Olympics.jpg|thumb| Cassius Clay (second from right and later Ali) at the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympics]]]]

Clay was first directed toward boxing by Louisville police officer and boxing coach [[Joe E. Martin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.articleclick.com/Article/Boxing-Legend---Muhammad-Ali/938509 |title=Boxing Legend  Muhammad Ali |last=Kandel |first=Elmo |date=April 1, 2006 |work=Article Click |publisher=Elmo Kandel |accessdate=March 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611174640/http://www.articleclick.com/Article/Boxing-Legend---Muhammad-Ali/938509 |archivedate=June 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who encountered the 12-year-old fuming over a thief's having taken his bicycle. He told the officer he was going to "whup" the thief. The officer told Clay he had better learn how to box first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 20, 2008|url=http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring05/Shaffer/clay.html|title=Muhammad Ali|website=[[University of Florida]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Clay did not take up Martin's offer, but after seeing amateur boxers on a local television boxing program called ''Tomorrow's Champions'', Clay was interested in the prospect of fighting.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} He then began to work with trainer Fred Stoner, whom he credits with giving him the "real training", eventually moulding "my style, my stamina and my system". For the last four years of Clay's amateur career he was trained by boxing [[cutman]] [[Chuck Bodak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ringtalk.com.lhost9.atlantic.net/index.php?action=fullnews&amp;showcomments=1&amp;id=1553|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414160235/http://ringtalk.com.lhost9.atlantic.net/index.php?action=fullnews&amp;showcomments=1&amp;id=1553|archivedate=April 14, 2015|title='GODFATHER' OF CUTMEN-CHUCK BODAK SUFFERS STROKE|website=RingTalk  |accessdate=April 14, 2015 |date= September 2, 2007 |author=Fernandez, Pedro Fernandez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clay made his amateur boxing debut in 1954 against local amateur boxer Ronnie O'Keefe. He won by split decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Gray |first=Geoffey |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/06/how-muhammad-ali-became-a-boxer.html |title=How Muhammad Ali Became a Boxer  Daily Intelligencer|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=June 4, 2016| accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to win six Kentucky [[Golden Gloves]] titles, two national Golden Gloves titles, an [[Amateur Athletic Union]] national title, and the [[Light Heavyweight]] gold medal in the [[Boxing at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Summer Olympics]] in Rome.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/5/2006_5_48.shtml |first=Nathan |last=Ward |title=A Total Eclipse of the Sonny |work=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]] |date=October 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111061103/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/5/2006_5_48.shtml |archivedate=January 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clay's amateur record was 100 wins with five losses. Ali said in his 1975 autobiography that shortly after his return from the Rome Olympics, he threw his gold medal into the [[Ohio River]] after he and a friend were refused service at a "whites-only" restaurant and fought with a white gang. The story was later disputed, and several of Ali's friends, including [[Drew Bundini Brown|Bundini Brown]] and photographer [[Howard Bingham]], denied it. Brown told ''Sports Illustrated'' writer Mark Kram, "[[Honky|Honkies]] sure bought into that one!" [[Thomas Hauser]]'s biography of Ali stated that Ali was refused service at the diner but that he lost his medal a year after he won it.&lt;ref name="Hauser 2004"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hauser|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali received a replacement medal at a basketball intermission during the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics in Atlanta]], where he lit the torch to start the games.

==Professional boxing==

===Early career===
[[File:1961 Cassius Clay vs. Donnie Fleeman On-Site Poster.jpg|thumb|upright|On-site poster for Cassius Clay's fifth professional bout]]
Clay made his professional debut on October 29, 1960, winning a six-round decision over [[Tunney Hunsaker]]. From then until the end of 1963, Clay amassed a record of 190 with 15 wins by knockout. He defeated boxers that included Tony Esperti, [[Jim Robinson (boxer)|Jim Robinson]], Donnie Fleeman, Alonzo Johnson, George Logan, Willi Besmanoff, [[LaMar Clark]], [[Doug Jones (boxer)|Doug Jones]] and [[Henry Cooper]]. Clay also beat his former trainer and veteran boxer [[Archie Moore]] in a 1962 match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Calkins|first=Matt|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2014/nov/17/archie-moore-the52-boxing-heavyweight/|title=Archie Moore was the KO king|work=[[U-T San Diego]]|date=November 17, 2014|accessdate=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mgDK3q6GWI8C|title=Ali in Action: The Man, the Moves, the Mouth|first=Les|last=Krantz|date=January 1, 2008|publisher=Globe Pequot|accessdate=June 15, 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These early fights were not without trials. Clay was knocked down both by [[Sonny Banks]] and Cooper. In the Cooper fight, Clay was floored by a left [[Hook (boxing)|hook]] at the end of round four and was saved by the bell, going on to win in the predicted 5th round due to Cooper's severely cut eye. The fight with Doug Jones on March 13, 1963 was Clay's toughest fight during this stretch. The number-two and -three heavyweight contenders respectively, Clay and Jones fought on Jones' home turf at New York's [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]]. Jones staggered Clay in the first round, and the unanimous decision for Clay was greeted by boos and a rain of debris thrown into the ring (watching on closed-circuit TV, heavyweight champ Sonny Liston quipped that if he fought Clay he might get locked up for murder). The fight was later named "Fight of the Year" by ''The Ring'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Velin|first=Bob|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2016/06/04/muhammad-ali-fight-by-fight-career/85341622/|title=Fight by fight: Muhammad Ali's legendary career|work=[[USA Today]]|date=June 4, 2016|accessdate=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In each of these fights, Clay vocally belittled his opponents and vaunted his abilities. He called Jones "an ugly little man" and Cooper a "bum". He was embarrassed to get in the ring with Alex Miteff. Madison Square Garden was "too small for me".&lt;ref name=Mee&gt;Bob Mee, ''Ali and Liston: The Boy Who Would Be King and the Ugly Bear'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Clay's behavior provoked the ire of many boxing fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3622439/Boxing-great-Muhammad-Ali-hospital-respiratory-issue.html|title=Boxing legend Muhammad Ali, 74, hospitalized with respiratory issue  but spokesman says he's 'in fair condition'|date=June 2, 2016|accessdate=June 3, 2016|work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; His provocative and outlandish behavior in the ring was inspired by [[professional wrestler]] [[Gorgeous George|"Gorgeous George" Wagner]].&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1114630/index.htm |title=King Strut |first=John |last=Capouya |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |accessdate=March 14, 2017 |date=December 12, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603232105/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1114630/index.htm |archivedate=June 3, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ali stated in a 1969 interview with the Associated Press' Hubert Mizel that he met with Gorgeous George in Las Vegas in 1961 and that the wrestler inspired him to use wrestling jargon when he did interviews.&lt;ref name=georgali&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/general/news/how-muhammad-alis-fascination-with-pro-wrestling-fueled-his-career-inspired-mma/|title=How Muhammad Ali's fascination with pro wrestling fueled his career, inspired MMA|first=Denny|last=Burkholder|publisher=CBS Sports|date=June 6, 2016|accessdate=October 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Clay left Moore's camp in 1960, partially due to Clay's refusing to do chores such as dish-washing and sweeping, he hired [[Angelo Dundee]], whom he had met in February 1957 during Ali's amateur career,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/7470417/muhammad-ali-was-continues-greatest | publisher=ESPN | title=Dundee: Ali was, still is 'The Greatest' | date=January 17, 2012 | accessdate=January 17, 2012 | first1=Carlos | last1=Irusta}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be his trainer. Around this time, Clay sought longtime idol [[Sugar Ray Robinson]] to be his manager, but was rebuffed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haygood |first=Wil |authorlink=Wil Haygood |title=Sweet Thunder: The Life and Times of Sugar Ray Robinson |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q_nfLUMzlM0C&amp;pg=PA378&amp;hl=en |page=378 |publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]] |date=April 1, 2011 |accessdate=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heavyweight champion===
====Fights against Liston====
{{Main|Muhammad Ali vs. Sonny Liston}}
By late 1963, Clay had become the top contender for Sonny Liston's title. The fight was set for February 25, 1964, in [[Miami Beach]]. Liston was an intimidating personality, a dominating fighter with a criminal past and ties to the mob. Based on Clay's uninspired performance against Jones and Cooper in his previous two fights, and Liston's destruction of former heavyweight champion [[Floyd Patterson]] in two first-round knock outs, Clay was a 71 underdog. Despite this, Clay taunted Liston during the pre-fight buildup, dubbing him "the big ugly bear". "Liston even smells like a bear", Clay said. "After I beat him I'm going to donate him to the zoo."&lt;ref&gt;[{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=vkvoAgAAQBAJ|page=147|text=Liston even smells like a bear}} Remnick (1998), p. 147]&lt;/ref&gt; Clay turned the pre-fight weigh-in into a circus, shouting at Liston that "someone is going to die at ringside tonight". Clay's pulse rate was measured at 120, more than double his normal 54.&lt;ref name="Liston"&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Lipsyte |title=Clay Wins Title in Seventh-Round Upset As Liston Is Halted by Shoulder Injury |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/10/25/specials/ali-upset.html |work=The New York Times |date=February 26, 1964 |accessdate=December 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those in attendance thought Clay's behavior stemmed from fear, and some commentators wondered if he would show up for the bout.

The outcome of the fight was a major upset. At the opening bell, Liston rushed at Clay, seemingly angry and looking for a quick knockout, but Clay's superior speed and mobility enabled him to elude Liston, making the champion miss and look awkward. At the end of the first round, Clay opened up his attack and hit Liston repeatedly with jabs. Liston fought better in round two, but at the beginning of the third round Clay hit Liston with a combination that buckled his knees and opened a cut under his left eye. This was the first time Liston had ever been cut. At the end of round four, Clay was returning to his corner when he began experiencing blinding pain in his eyes and asked his trainer [[Angelo Dundee]] to cut off his gloves. Dundee refused. It has been speculated that the problem was due to ointment used to seal Liston's cuts, perhaps deliberately applied by his corner to his gloves.&lt;ref name="Liston" /&gt; Though unconfirmed, [[Bert Sugar]] claimed that two of Liston's opponents also complained about their eyes "burning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Sugar |first=Bert Randolph |title=Bert Sugar on Boxing: The Best of the Sport's Most Notable Writer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tJ2uBBsN0E0C |date=November 1, 2003 |publisher=Globe Pequot |isbn=978-1-59228-048-3 |page=196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In an interview in 1974, Ali said that, prior to his later fight with Foreman, a one-time member of Liston's entourage offered him a linament that could be applied to boxing gloves and that would cause a blinding, temporary stinging of the eyes. {{YouTube|nKGdopYDIWU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Liston's attempts to knock out a blinded Clay, Clay was able to survive the fifth round until sweat and tears rinsed the irritation from his eyes. In the sixth, Clay dominated, hitting Liston repeatedly. Liston did not answer the bell for the seventh round, and Clay was declared the winner by [[Technical knockout|TKO]]. Liston stated that the reason he quit was an injured shoulder. Following the win, a triumphant Clay rushed to the edge of the ring and, pointing to the ringside press, shouted: "Eat your words!" He added, "I am the greatest! I shook up the world. I'm the prettiest thing that ever lived."&lt;ref&gt;''Pranksters: Making Mischief in the Modern World'' by Kembrew McLeod, pp. 2234&lt;/ref&gt;

At ringside post fight, Ali appeared unconvinced that the fight was stopped due to a Liston shoulder injury, indicating, rather, that the injury Liston had was "an open eye, a big cut eye!" Ali however, when told by Joe Louis that the injury was a "left arm thrown out of its socket" quipped, "Yeah, swinging at nothing, who wouldn't!"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4IKMX-5JLk&lt;/ref&gt;

In winning this fight, Clay became at age 22 the youngest boxer to take the title from a reigning heavyweight champion, though [[Floyd Patterson]] was the youngest to win the heavyweight championship at 21, during an elimination bout following [[Rocky Marciano]]'s retirement. [[Mike Tyson]] broke both records in 1986 when he defeated [[Trevor Berbick]] to win the heavyweight title at age 20.

Soon after the Liston fight, Clay changed his name to Cassius X, and then later to Muhammad Ali upon converting to Islam and affiliating with the [[Nation of Islam]]. Ali then faced a rematch with Liston scheduled for May 1965 in [[Lewiston, Maine]]. It had been scheduled for Boston the previous November, but was postponed for six months due to Ali's emergency surgery for a hernia three days before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cuddy|first=Jack|title=Clay Undergoes Surgery; Fight Is Off Indefinitely |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9544811/the_bridgeport_telegram/|newspaper=[[The Bridgeport Telegram]]|date=November 14, 1964|page=1 |via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = March 14, 2017 }} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight was controversial. Midway through the first round, Liston was knocked down by a difficult-to-see blow the press dubbed a "phantom punch". Ali refused to retreat to a neutral corner, and referee [[Jersey Joe Walcott]] did not begin the count. Liston rose after he had been down about 20 seconds, and the fight momentarily continued. But a few seconds later Walcott stopped the match, declaring Ali the winner by knockout. The entire fight lasted less than two minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/16/sports/sports-of-the-times-on-his-50th-ali-is-still-the-greatest.html | work=The New York Times | title=Sports of The Times; On His 50th, Ali Is Still 'The Greatest' | date=January 16, 1992 | accessdate=January 25, 2012 | first1=Dave | last1=Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has since been speculated that Liston purposely dropped to the ground. Proposed motivations include threats on his life from the Nation of Islam, that he had bet against himself and that he "took a dive" to pay off debts. Slow-motion replays show that Liston was jarred by a chopping right from Ali, although it is unclear whether the blow was a genuine knockout punch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vachss |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Vachss |url=http://www.vachss.com/only_child/index.html |title=Only Child |page=89 |publisher=Vintage |year=2003}} Vachss further explains the way such a fix would have been engineered in {{cite book |url=http://twotrainsrunning.com/ |title=Two Trains Running |pages=160165, 233 |publisher=Pantheon |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fight against Patterson====
{{Main|Muhammad Ali vs. Floyd Patterson}}

Ali defended his title against former heavyweight champion [[Floyd Patterson]] on November 22, 1965. Before the match, Ali mocked Patterson, who was widely known to call him by his former name Cassius Clay, as an "[[Uncle Tom syndrome|Uncle Tom]]", calling him "The Rabbit". Although Ali clearly had the better of Patterson, who appeared injured during the fight, the match lasted 12 rounds before being called on a technical knockout. Patterson later said he had strained his [[Sacroiliac joint|sacroiliac]]. Ali was criticized in the sports media for appearing to have toyed with Patterson during the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/37158310/|agency=Sports on Earth|title=ALI-PATTERSON: THE REAL STORY|date=August 27, 2012|accessdate=June 3, 2016|first=Alex|last=Belth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Main Bout====
After the Patterson fight, Ali founded his own promotion company, Main Bout. The company mainly handled Ali's boxing promotions and [[pay-per-view]] [[closed-circuit television]] broadcasts. The company's stockholders were mainly fellow [[Nation of Islam]] members, along with several others, including [[Bob Arum]].&lt;ref name="Ezra105"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ezra|first=Michael|title=The Economic Civil Rights Movement: African Americans and the Struggle for Economic Power|date=2013|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9781136274756|page=105|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DL41bsCigZcC&amp;pg=PA105|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Muhammad Ali 1966.jpg|thumb|left|Ali in 1966]]
Ali and then-[[World Boxing Association|WBA]] heavyweight champion boxer [[Ernie Terrell]] had agreed to meet for a bout in Chicago on March 29, 1966 (the WBA, one of two boxing associations, had stripped Ali of his title following his joining the Nation of Islam). But in February Ali was reclassified by the Louisville draft board as 1-A from 1-Y, and he indicated that he would refuse to serve, commenting to the press, "I ain't got nothing against no [[Viet Cong]]; no Viet Cong never called me nigger."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shalit |first=Nevin I. |title=Muhammad Ali: Losing the Real Title |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1980/7/15/muhammad-ali-losing-the-real-title/ |newspaper=The Harvard Crimson |date=July 15, 1980 |accessdate=August 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst the media and public outcry over Ali's stance, the Illinois Athletic Commission refused to sanction the fight, citing technicalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |title=He Could Go To Jail And Still Be Champ |date=August 28, 1967 |first1=Angelo |last1=Dundee |first2=Tex |last2=Maule}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, Ali traveled to [[Canada]] and Europe and won championship bouts against [[George Chuvalo]], [[Henry Cooper]], [[Brian London]] and [[Karl Mildenberger]].

Ali returned to the United States to fight [[Cleveland Williams]] in the Houston Astrodome on November 14, 1966. The bout drew a record-breaking indoor crowd of 35,460 people. Williams had once been considered among the hardest punchers in the heavyweight division, but in 1964 he had been shot at point-blank range by a Texas policeman, resulting in the loss of one kidney and {{convert|10|ft|m}} of his small intestine. Ali dominated Williams, winning a third-round technical knockout in what some consider the finest performance of his career.

Ali fought Terrell in Houston on February 6, 1967. Terrell was billed as Ali's toughest opponent since Listonunbeaten in five years and having defeated many of the boxers Ali had faced. Terrell was big, strong and had a three-inch reach advantage over Ali. During the lead up to the bout, Terrell repeatedly called Ali "Clay", much to Ali's annoyance (Ali called Cassius Clay his "slave name"). The two almost came to blows over the name issue in a pre-fight interview with [[Howard Cosell]]. Ali seemed intent on humiliating Terrell. "I want to torture him", he said. "A clean knockout is too good for him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tex |last=Maule |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1079523/1/index.htm |title=Cruel Ali With All The Skills |date=February 13, 1967 |work=Sports Illustrated |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309201457/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1079523/1/index.htm |archivedate=March 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight was close until the seventh round when Ali bloodied Terrell and almost knocked him out. In the eighth round, Ali taunted Terrell, hitting him with jabs and shouting between punches, "What's my name, Uncle Tom... what's my name?" Ali won a unanimous 15-round decision. Terrell claimed that early in the fight Ali deliberately thumbed him in the eyeforcing Terrell to fight half-blindand then, in a clinch, rubbed the wounded eye against the ropes. Because of Ali's apparent intent to prolong the fight to inflict maximum punishment, critics described the bout as "one of the ugliest boxing fights". [[Tex Maule]] later wrote: "It was a wonderful demonstration of boxing skill and a barbarous display of cruelty." Ali denied the accusations of cruelty but, for Ali's critics, the fight provided more evidence of his arrogance.

After Ali's title defense against [[Zora Folley]] on March 22, he was stripped of his title due to his refusal to be drafted to army service.&lt;ref name="greatath"/&gt; His boxing license was also suspended by the state of New York. He was convicted of draft evasion on June 20 and sentenced to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. He paid a bond and remained free while the verdict was being appealed.

===Exile and comeback===
In March 1966, Ali [[#Vietnam War and resistance to the draft|refused to be inducted into the armed forces]]. He was systematically denied a boxing license in every state and stripped of his passport. As a result, he did not fight from March 1967 to October 1970from ages 25 to almost 29as his case worked its way through the appeals process before his conviction was overturned in 1971. During this time of inactivity, as [[opposition to the Vietnam War]] began to grow and Ali's stance gained sympathy, he spoke at colleges across the nation, criticizing the Vietnam War and advocating African American pride and racial justice.

====''The Super Fight''====
{{Main|The Super Fight}}
While banned from sanctioned bouts, Ali settled a $1 million lawsuit against radio producer Murray Woroner by accepting $10,000 to appear in a privately staged fantasy fight against retired champion Rocky Marciano.&lt;ref name="Enterprise News Sep 2009"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ali vs. Marciano: Who wins?|url=http://www.enterprisenews.com/article/20090901/News/309019646 |work=The Enterprise |date=September 1, 2009 |accessdate=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 the boxers were filmed sparring for about 75 one-minute rounds; they acted out several different endings.&lt;ref name="The Guardian Nov 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title = The forgotten story of  the Rocky Marciano v Muhammad Ali Super Fight| url = https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/nov/13/forgotten-story-rocky-marciano-muhammad-ali| date = November 13, 2012| publisher = The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A computer program purportedly determined the winner, based on data about the fighters. Edited versions of the bout were shown in movie theaters in 1970. In the U.S. version Ali lost in a simulated 13th-round knockout, but in the European version Marciano lost due to cuts, also simulated.&lt;ref name="Bingham 218"&gt;{{cite book|title=Muhammad Ali's Greatest Fight: Cassius Clay vs. the United States of America|first1= Howard|last1=Bingham|first2=Max|last2=Wallace|publisher=M.

He was reported to say, "That computer was made in Alabama."&lt;ref name="Enterprise News Sep 2009"/&gt;

====Legal vindication====
On August 11, 1970, with his case still in appeal, Ali was granted a license to box by the City of Atlanta Athletic Commission, thanks to State Senator [[Leroy Johnson (Georgia politician)|Leroy R. Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=John H. |last=Britton |title=Ga. Senator Gets TKOed By His Political 'Friends' |work=Jet |date=March 4, 1971 |pages=5254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali's first return bout was against [[Jerry Quarry]] on October 26, resulting in a win after three rounds after Quarry was cut.

A month earlier, a victory in federal court forced the New York State Boxing Commission to reinstate Ali's license.&lt;ref name=cgnyrl &gt;{{cite news |url=http://palmbeachpost.newspapers.com/image/132677737/?terms=%22Clay%2Bgranted%2BNew%2BYork%2Bring%2Blicense%22 |newspaper=The Palm Beach Post |agency=Associated Press |title=Clay granted New York ring license |date=September 15, 1970 |page=B4 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He fought [[Oscar Bonavena]] at Madison Square Garden in December, an uninspired performance that ended in a dramatic [[technical knockout]] of Bonavena in the 15th round. The win left Ali as a top contender against heavyweight champion [[Joe Frazier]].

====First fight against Joe Frazier====
{{Main|Fight of the Century}}
Ali and Frazier's first fight, held at the Garden on March 8, 1971, was nicknamed the "[[Fight of the Century]]", due to the tremendous excitement surrounding a bout between two undefeated fighters, each with a legitimate claim as heavyweight champions. Veteran boxing writer John Condon called it "the greatest event I've ever worked on in my life". The bout was broadcast to 35 foreign countries; promoters granted 760 press passes.&lt;ref name="Hauser 2004"/&gt;

Adding to the atmosphere were the considerable pre-fight theatrics and name calling. Ali portrayed Frazier as a "dumb tool of the white establishment". "Frazier is too ugly to be champ", Ali said. "Frazier is too dumb to be champ." Ali also frequently called Frazier an "Uncle Tom". Dave Wolf, who worked in Frazier's camp, recalled that, "Ali was saying 'the only people rooting for Joe Frazier are white people in suits, Alabama sheriffs, and members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. I'm fighting for the little man in the ghetto.' Joe was sitting there, smashing his fist into the palm of his hand, saying, 'What the fuck does he know about the ghetto?{{' "}}&lt;ref name="Hauser 2004"/&gt;

Ali began training at a farm near Reading, Pennsylvania, in 1971 and, finding the country setting to his liking, sought to develop a [[Muhammad Ali's Deer Lake Training Camp|real training camp]] in the countryside. He found a five-acre site on a Pennsylvania country road in the village of Deer Lake, Pennsylvania. On this site, Ali carved out what was to become his training camp, the camp where he lived and trained for all the many fights he had from 1972 on to the end of his career in the 1980s.

The Monday night fight lived up to its billing. In a preview of their two other fights, a crouching, bobbing and weaving Frazier constantly pressured Ali, getting hit regularly by Ali jabs and combinations, but relentlessly attacking and scoring repeatedly, especially to Ali's body. The fight was even in the early rounds, but Ali was taking more punishment than ever in his career. On several occasions in the early rounds he played to the crowd and shook his head "no" after he was hit. In the later roundsin what was the first appearance of the "[[rope-a-dope|rope-a-dope strategy]]"Ali leaned against the ropes and absorbed punishment from Frazier, hoping to tire him. In the 11th round, Frazier connected with a left hook that wobbled Ali, but because it appeared that Ali might be clowning as he staggered backwards across the ring, Frazier hesitated to press his advantage, fearing an Ali counter-attack. In the final round, Frazier knocked Ali down with a vicious left hook, which referee Arthur Mercante said was as hard as a man can be hit. Ali was back on his feet in three seconds.&lt;ref name="Hauser 2004"/&gt; Nevertheless, Ali lost by unanimous decision, his first professional defeat.

====Fights against Chamberlain, Quarry, Patterson, Foster and Norton====
In 1971, basketball star [[Wilt Chamberlain]] challenged Ali to a fight, and a bout was scheduled for July 26. Although the seven foot two inch tall Chamberlain had formidable physical advantages over Aliweighing 60{{nbsp}}pounds more and able to reach 14{{nbsp}}inches furtherAli was able to intimidate Chamberlain into calling off the bout by taunting him with calls of "Timber!" and "The tree will fall" during a shared interview. These statements of confidence unsettled his taller opponent to the point that he called off the bout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Reilly|first1=Terry|title=Achilles Heel Advertising: Repositioning the Competition|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/undertheinfluence/achilles-heel-advertising-repositioning-the-competition-1.3473631|accessdate=March 27, 2016|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the loss to Frazier, Ali fought Jerry Quarry, had a second bout with Floyd Patterson and faced [[Bob Foster (boxer)|Bob Foster]] in 1972, winning a total of six fights that year. In 1973, [[Ken Norton]] broke Ali's jaw while giving him the second loss of his career. After initially considering retirement, Ali won a controversial decision against Norton in their second bout. This led to a rematch with Joe Frazier at Madison Square Garden on January 28, 1974; Frazier had recently lost his title to George Foreman.

====Second fight against Joe Frazier====
{{Main|Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier II}}
Ali was strong in the early rounds of the fight, and staggered Frazier in the second round. Referee Tony Perez mistakenly thought he heard the bell ending the round and stepped between the two fighters as Ali was pressing his attack, giving Frazier time to recover. However, Frazier came on in the middle rounds, snapping Ali's head in round seven and driving him to the ropes at the end of round eight. The last four rounds saw round-to-round shifts in momentum between the two fighters. Throughout most of the bout, however, Ali was able to circle away from Frazier's dangerous left hook and to tie Frazier up when he was cornered, the latter a tactic that Frazier's camp complained of bitterly. Judges awarded Ali a unanimous decision.

===Heavyweight champion (second reign)===
====The Rumble in the Jungle====
{{Main|The Rumble in the Jungle}}
The defeat of Frazier set the stage for a title fight against heavyweight champion [[George Foreman]] in Kinshasa, [[Zaire]], on October 30, 1974a bout nicknamed "[[The Rumble in the Jungle]]". Foreman was considered one of the hardest punchers in heavyweight history. In assessing the fight, analysts pointed out that [[Joe Frazier]] and [[Ken Norton]]who had given Ali four tough battles and won two of themhad been both devastated by Foreman in second-round knockouts. Ali was 32 years old, and had clearly lost speed and reflexes since his twenties. Contrary to his later persona, Foreman was at the time a brooding and intimidating presence. Almost no one associated with the sport, not even Ali's long-time supporter [[Howard Cosell]], gave the former champion a chance of winning.

As usual, Ali was confident and colorful before the fight. He told interviewer [[David Frost]], "If you think the world was surprised when Nixon resigned, wait 'til I whup Foreman's behind!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aGHpXt_hMc |title=Muhammad Ali- The Rumble In The Jungle(Interview) |publisher=YouTube |date=March 22, 1967 |accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told the press, "I've done something new for this fight. I done wrestled with an alligator, I done tussled with a whale; handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder in jail; only last week, I murdered a rock, injured a stone, hospitalized a brick; I'm so mean I make medicine sick."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGk0R63C0eM |title=Muhammad Ali Inspirational Speech (Cassius Clay Boxing Motivation) |publisher=YouTube |date=September 14, 2012 |accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali was wildly popular in Zaire, with crowds chanting "Ali, bomaye" ("Ali, kill him") wherever he went.

Ali opened the fight moving and scoring with right crosses to Foreman's head. Then, beginning in the second roundand to the consternation of his cornerAli retreated to the ropes and invited Foreman to hit him while covering up, clinching and counter-punching, all while verbally taunting Foreman. The move, which would later become known as the "[[Rope-a-dope]]", so violated conventional boxing wisdomletting one of the hardest hitters in boxing strike at willthat at ringside writer [[George Plimpton]] thought the fight had to be fixed.&lt;ref name="Hauser 2004"/&gt; Foreman, increasingly angered, threw punches that were deflected and did not land squarely. Midway through the fight, as Foreman began tiring, Ali countered more frequently and effectively with punches and flurries, which electrified the pro-Ali crowd. In the eighth round, Ali dropped an exhausted Foreman with a combination at center ring; Foreman failed to make the count. Against the odds, and amidst pandemonium in the ring, Ali had regained the title by knockout. In reflecting on the fight, George Foreman later said: "I thought Ali was just one more knockout victim until, about the seventh round, I hit him hard to the jaw and he held me and whispered in my ear: 'That all you got, George?' I realized that this ain't what I thought it was."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Foreman |first=George |url=http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/sport/george-foreman-on-ali |title=George Foreman on why Muhammad Ali was so much more than a 'boxer' |magazine=[[ShortList]] |date=January 2012 |accessdate=June 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fights against Wepner, Lyle and Bugner====
Ali's next opponents included [[Chuck Wepner]], [[Ron Lyle]], and [[Joe Bugner]]. Wepner, a journeyman known as "The Bayonne Bleeder", stunned Ali with a knockdown in the ninth round; Ali would later say he tripped on Wepner's foot. It was a bout that would inspire [[Sylvester Stallone]] to create the acclaimed film, ''[[Rocky (film)|Rocky]]''.

====Third fight against Joe Frazier====
{{Main|Thrilla in Manila}}
Ali then agreed to a third match with Joe Frazier in [[Manila]]. The bout, known as the "[[Thrilla in Manila]]", was held on October 1, 1975,&lt;ref name="greatath"/&gt; in temperatures approaching {{convert|100|F|C}}. In the first rounds, Ali was aggressive, moving and exchanging blows with Frazier. However, Ali soon appeared to tire and adopted the "rope-a-dope" strategy, frequently resorting to clinches. During this part of the bout Ali did some effective counter-punching, but for the most part absorbed punishment from a relentlessly attacking Frazier. In the 12th round, Frazier began to tire, and Ali scored several sharp blows that closed Frazier's left eye and opened a cut over his right eye. With Frazier's vision now diminished, Ali dominated the 13th and 14th rounds, at times conducting what boxing historian Mike Silver called "target practice" on Frazier's head. The fight was stopped when Frazier's trainer, Eddie Futch, refused to allow Frazier to answer the bell for the 15th and final round, despite Frazier's protests. Frazier's eyes were both swollen shut. Ali, in his corner, winner by TKO, slumped on his stool, clearly spent.

An ailing Ali said afterwards that the fight "was the closest thing to dying that I know", and, when later asked if he had viewed the fight on videotape, reportedly said, "Why would I want to go back and see Hell?" After the fight he cited Frazier as "the greatest fighter of all times next to me".

===Later career===

Following the Manila bout, Ali fought [[Jean-Pierre Coopman]], [[Jimmy Young (boxer)|Jimmy Young]], and [[Richard Dunn (boxer)|Richard Dunn]], winning the last by knockout.

On June 1, 1976, Ali removed his shirt and jacket and confronted [[professional wrestler]] [[Gorilla Monsoon]] in the ring after his match at a [[World Wide Wrestling Federation]] show in [[Philadelphia Arena]]. After dodging a few punches, Monsoon put Ali in an [[airplane spin]] and dumped him to the mat. Ali stumbled to the corner, where his associate [[Butch Lewis]] convinced him to walk away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://boxinghalloffame.com/muhammad-ali-boxing-a-monsoon/|title=Muhammad Ali Boxing a Monsoon  Boxing Hall of Fame|date=December 29, 2012|publisher=boxinghalloffame.com|accessdate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 1976, Ali participated in [[Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki|an exhibition bout]] in [[Tokyo]] against Japanese professional wrestler and martial artist [[Antonio Inoki]].&lt;ref name="sweetScience"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tallent |first=Aaron |title=The Joke That Almost Ended Ali's Career |url=http://www.thesweetscience.com/articles-of-2005/1716-the-joke-that-almost-ended-ali-s-career |accessdate=December 4, 2007 |publisher=The Sweet Science |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709012841/http://www.thesweetscience.com/articles-of-2005/1716-the-joke-that-almost-ended-ali-s-career |archivedate=July 9, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali was only able to land two jabs while Inoki's kicks caused two blood clots and an infection that almost resulted in Ali's leg being amputated.&lt;ref name="sweetScience" /&gt;&lt;ref name="leastMemorable"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/06/sports/who-lost-when-muhammad-ali-fought-a-pro-wrestler-the-fans.html "Ali's Least Memorable Fight", by Victor Mather, ''The New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt; The match was not scripted and ultimately declared a draw.&lt;ref name="sweetScience" /&gt; After Ali's death, ''The New York Times'' declared it his least memorable fight.&lt;ref name="leastMemorable" /&gt; Most boxing commentators at the time viewed the fight negatively and hoped it would be forgotten as some considered it a "15-round farse."&lt;ref name="forgottenInfluence"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gross|first1=Josh|title=Muhammad Alis Forgotten Fight Was Also One of His Most Influential|url=http://www.newsweek.com/muhammad-ali-antonio-inoki-mixed-martial-arts-ufc-japan-mma-boxing-wrestling-474502|accessdate=April 10, 2018|publisher=Newsweek|date=June 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is considered by some to be one of Ali's most influential fights and CBS Sports said the attention the mixed-style bout received "foretold the arrival of standardized [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] years later."&lt;ref name="forgottenInfluence" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burkholder|first=Denny|url=http://www.cbssports.com/general/news/how-muhammad-alis-fascination-with-pro-wrestling-fueled-his-career-inspired-mma/|title=How Muhammad Ali's fascination with pro wrestling fueled his career, inspired MMA|publisher=[[CBS Sports]]|date=June 6, 2016|accessdate=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali fought Ken Norton for the third time in September 1976. The bout, which was held at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], resulted in Ali winning a heavily contested decision that was loudly booed by the audience. Afterwards, he announced he was retiring from boxing to practice his faith, having converted to [[Sunni Islam]] after falling out with the Nation of Islam the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newspaperarchive.com/SiteMap/FreePdfPreview.aspx?img=110827611?sec=Sports|title=Champion Ali Quits Boxing|work=The Paris News|page=12|accessdate=October 19, 2011 | date=October 1, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to beat [[Alfredo Evangelista]] in May 1977, Ali struggled in his next fight against [[Earnie Shavers]] that September, getting pummeled a few times by punches to the head. Ali won the fight by another unanimous decision, but the bout caused his longtime doctor [[Ferdie Pacheco]] to quit after he was rebuffed for telling Ali he should retire. Pacheco was quoted as saying, "the New York State Athletic Commission gave me a report that showed Ali's kidneys were falling apart. I wrote to Angelo Dundee, Ali's trainer, his wife and Ali himself. I got nothing back in response. That's when I decided enough is enough."&lt;ref name="Hauser 2004"/&gt;

In February 1978, Ali faced [[Leon Spinks]] at the Hilton Hotel in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. At the time, Spinks had only seven professional fights to his credit, and had recently fought a draw with journeyman Scott LeDoux. Ali sparred less than two dozen rounds in preparation for the fight, and was seriously out of shape by the opening bell. He lost the title by split decision. A rematch occurred in September at the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome|Superdome]] in New Orleans, Louisiana.  70,000 persons attended and paid a total of $6 million admission making it the largest live gate in boxing history at that time.&lt;ref name="Times-Picayune, New Orleans, Peter Finney's column from 1978"&gt;[http://www.nola.com/sports/index.ssf/2016/06/read_peter_finneys_column_from.html Read Peter Finney's column on Ali vs. Spinks 2 at the Superdome in 1978], ''The Times-Picayune'' NOLA.com (New Orleans, LA.), re-posted on June 4, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Ali won a unanimous decision in an uninspiring fight with referee Lucien Joubert scoring rounds 10-4, judge Ernie Cojoe 10-4, and judge Herman Preis 11-4.  This made Ali the first heavyweight champion to win the belt three times.&lt;ref&gt;''Muhammad Ali, The Glory Years'', Felix Dennis and Don Atyeo, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RingsideReport.com, Kevin Kincade, 2016"&gt;[http://ringsidereport.com/?p=63321 The Last Flight of the Butterfly: Remembering Ali vs Spinks II], RingsideReport.com, Kevin The Voice Kincade, Sept. 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this win, on July 27, 1979, Ali announced his retirement from boxing. His retirement was short-lived, however; Ali announced his comeback to face [[Larry Holmes]] for the WBC belt in an attempt to win the heavyweight championship an unprecedented fourth time. The fight was largely motivated by Ali's need for money. Boxing writer Richie Giachetti said, "Larry didn't want to fight Ali. He knew Ali had nothing left; he knew it would be a horror."

It was around this time that Ali started struggling with vocal stutters and trembling hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/21/us/muhammad-ali---fast-facts/ |title=Muhammad Ali Fast Facts |publisher=CNN |accessdate=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nevada Athletic Commission]] (NAC) ordered that he undergo a complete physical in Las Vegas before being allowed to fight again. Ali chose instead to check into the [[Mayo Clinic]], who declared him fit to fight. Their opinion was accepted by the NAC on July 31, 1980, paving the way for Ali's return to the ring.&lt;ref name="LVSun 50"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/muhammad-ali/timeline/ |title=Timeline: Fifty years of Las Vegas memories for Muhammad Ali |newspaper=Las Vegas Sun |accessdate=November 12, 2013 |last=Koch |first=Ed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fight took place on October 2, 1980, in Las Vegas Valley, with Holmes easily dominating Ali, who was weakened from thyroid medication he had taken to lose weight. Giachetti called the fight "awful ... the worst sports event I ever had to cover". Actor Sylvester Stallone was at ringside and said that it was like watching an autopsy on a man who is still alive.&lt;ref name="Hauser 2004"/&gt; In the eleventh round, Angelo Dundee told the referee to stop the fight, making it the only time that Ali ever lost by [[technical knockout|stoppage]]. The Holmes fight is said to have contributed to Ali's Parkinson's syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/arts/television/27muhammad.html | work=The New York Times | title=Boxing King Casts His Shadow, Even at Time of Defeat | date=October 26, 2009 | accessdate=March 5, 2012 | first1=Mike | last1=Hale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite pleas to definitively retire, Ali fought one last time on December 11, 1981, in Nassau, [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]], against [[Trevor Berbick]], losing a ten-round decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ali to try again? |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1870&amp;dat=19810816&amp;id=9_EwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_uAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2603,113296&amp;hl=en |newspaper=The Daytona Beach Sunday News-Journal |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Google News Archive |date=August 16, 1981 |accessdate=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=It's all over for Ali after loss |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&amp;dat=19811212&amp;id=XKUyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gOcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3700,2405394&amp;hl=en |newspaper=Lawrence Journal-World |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Google News Archive |date=December 12, 1981 |accessdate=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=William |last=Nack |authorlink=William Nack |title=Not with a bang but a whisper |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1981/12/21/826243/not-with-a-bang-but-a-whisper-after-losing-to-trevor-berbick-a-subdued-muhammad-ali-softly-admitted-that-his-illustrious-career-had-come-to-an-end |website=Sports Illustrated |date=December 21, 1981 |accessdate=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
===Marriages and children===
Ali was married four times and had seven daughters and two sons. Ali was introduced to cocktail waitress Sonji Roi by Herbert Muhammad and asked her to marry him after their first date. They were wed approximately one month later on August 14, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Micklos | first = John Jr. | title = Muhammad Ali: "I Am the Greatest" |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wjeaQAmQ0FMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA54#v=onepage&amp;f=false | year = 2010 | publisher = [[Enslow Publishers]] | location = Berkeley Heights, NJ | isbn = 978-0-7660-3381-8 | page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; They quarrelled over Sonji's refusal to adhere to strict Islamic dress and behavior codes, and her questioning of Elijah Muhammad's teachings. According to Ali, "She wouldn't do what she was supposed to do. She wore lipstick; she went into bars; she dressed in clothes that were revealing and didn't look right."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hauser| first = Thomas | title = Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times | year = 2012 | publisher = Open Road Integrated Media | isbn = 978-1-4532-4119-6 | page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was childless and they divorced on January 10, 1966.

On August 17, 1967, Ali married [[Belinda Boyd]]. After the wedding, she, like Ali, converted to Islam. She changed her name to Khalilah Ali, though she was still called Belinda by old friends and family. They had four children: Maryum "May May" (born 1968), twins Jamillah and Rasheda (born 1970; Rasheda married Robert Walsh and has a son Biaggio Ali, born in 1998), and Muhammad Ali Jr. (born 1972).&lt;ref name="familytreemaker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/w/i/n/Keith-Winstead/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0094.html |title=Winstead, Fry, Clay, Greathouse, and Alexander Family Tree:Information about Muhammad Ali |publisher=Familytreemaker.genealogy.com |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maryum has a career as an author and rapper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L7QDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA38 |title=Muhammad Ali's Daughter, May May Ali, Writes Children's Book About His Boxing Career |date=December 8, 2003 |work=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] |volume=104 |issue=24 |pages=3839 |via=Google Books |issn=0021-5996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While still married to Belinda, Ali married Aaisha in an Islamic ceremony that was not legally recognized.

In 1975, Ali began an affair with [[Veronica Porch Ali|Veronica Porch]], an actress and model. While Ali was in the [[Philippines]] for the "[[Thrilla in Manila]]" bout vs. [[Joe Frazier]], Belinda was enraged when she saw Ali on television introducing Veronica to [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. She flew out to Manila to confront Ali and scratched his face when they argued. Belinda later said that her marriage to Ali was a "rollercoaster rideit had its ups and its downs but it was fun". Referring to his infidelities, she said: "[[Tiger Woods]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] didn't have nothing on Muhammad Ali". She believed he had "many more" illegitimate children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More Ali children will come out of the woodwork like cockroaches: Boxer's second wife warns of claims to his 55million fortune by illegitimate offspring |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3636203/More-Ali-children-come-woodwork-like-cockroaches-Boxer-s-second-wife-warns-claims-55million-fortune-illegitimate-offspring.html|work=Daily Mail|date=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 19, 1986, Ali married Yolanda ("Lonnie") Williams. They had been friends since 1964 in Louisville. Together they adopted a son, Asaad Amin, when Amin was five months old.

===Religion and beliefs===
{{Main|Religious views of Muhammad Ali}}

====Affiliation with the Nation of Islam====
Ali said that he first heard of the [[Nation of Islam]] when he was fighting in the Golden Gloves tournament in Chicago in 1959, and attended his first Nation of Islam meeting in 1961. He continued to attend meetings, although keeping his involvement hidden from the public. In 1962, Clay met [[Malcolm X]], who soon became his spiritual and political mentor.&lt;ref name="Guardian Mitchell"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mitchell |first=Kevin |title=From the Vietnam war to Islam  the key chapters in Ali's life |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/04/muhammad-ali-key-chapters |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=June 4, 2016 |accessdate=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the first Liston fight, Nation of Islam members, including Malcolm X, were visible in his entourage. This led to a story in ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' just before the fight disclosing that Clay had joined the Nation of Islam, which nearly caused the bout to be canceled. The article quoted Cassius Clay Sr. as saying that his son had joined the [[African American Muslims|Black Muslims]] when he was 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19640207&amp;id=XF4bAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-04EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5091,2145696|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|title=Muslim Charge Clams Up Clay |date=February 7, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elijah Muhammad and Cassius Clay NYWTS.jpg|thumb|left|Ali (seen in background) at an address by [[Elijah Muhammad]] in 1964]]
In fact, Clay was initially refused entry to the Nation of Islam (often called the Black [[Muslim]]s at the time) due to his boxing career. However, after he won the championship from Liston in 1964, the Nation of Islam was more receptive and agreed to publicize his membership.&lt;ref name="Guardian Mitchell" /&gt; Shortly afterwards on March 6, Elijah Muhammad gave a radio address that Clay would be renamed [[Muhammad]] (one who is worthy of praise) [[Ali (name)|Ali]] (most high).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.espn.com/sportscentury/features/00014063.html |title=He is simply ... The Greatest |last=Schwartz |first=Larry |publisher=ESPN |access-date=March 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time Ali moved to the south side of Chicago and lived in a series of houses, always near the Nation of Islam's [[Mosque Maryam]] or Elijah Muhammad's residence. He stayed in Chicago for about 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Steinberg |first=Neil |date=June 4, 2016 |title=For a time, Ali called Chicago home |url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/steinberg-for-a-time-ali-called-chicago-home|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |access-date=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a few journalists (most notably [[Howard Cosell]]) accepted the new name at that time. Ali later announced: "Cassius Clay is my slave name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p014mvdx |title=History website, Muhammad Ali: "Cassius Clay is my slave name" |publisher=BBC |accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not afraid to antagonize the white establishment, Ali stated, "I am America.

Aligning himself with the Nation of Islam, its leader [[Elijah Muhammad]], and a narrative that labeled the white race as the perpetrator of genocide against African Americans made Ali a target of public condemnation. The Nation of Islam was widely viewed by whites and some African Americans as a black separatist "hate religion" with a propensity toward violence; Ali had few qualms about using his influential voice to speak Nation of Islam doctrine.&lt;ref name="thegrio.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Garcia |first=Courtney |url=http://thegrio.com/2013/09/06/trials-of-muhammad-ali-highlights-boxers-anti-war-opposition/ |title='Trials of Muhammad Ali' highlights boxer's anti-war opposition |publisher=theGrio |date=September 6, 2013 |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a press conference articulating his opposition to the Vietnam War, Ali stated, "My enemy is the white people, not Viet Cong or Chinese or Japanese."&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-08-31/entertainment/ct-ae-0901-fall-movie-profile-20130831_1_muhammad-ali-opposer-chicago-director|title=The trials of a Chicago director making Muhammad Ali doc|website=Chicago Tribune|first=Nina|last=Metz|date=August 31, 2013|accessdate=July 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to integration, he said: "We who follow the teachings of Elijah Muhammad don't want to be forced to integrate. Integration is wrong. We don't want to live with the white man; that's all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mogul |first=Priyanka |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/muhammad-ali-why-boxing-legend-converted-islam-refused-serve-vietnam-war-1563671 |title=Muhammad Ali: Why the boxing legend converted to Islam and refused to serve in the Vietnam War |work=[[International Business Times]]|date=June 4, 2016 |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture: Volume 13: Gender |page=291 |editor1-last=Bercaw |editor1-first=Nancy |editor2-last=Ownby |editor2-first=Ted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[Jerry Izenberg]] once noted that, "the Nation became Ali's family and Elijah Muhammad became his father. But there is an irony to the fact that while the Nation branded white people as devils, Ali had more white colleagues than most African American people did at that time in America, and continued to have them throughout his career."&lt;ref name="Hauser 2004"/&gt;

====Later beliefs====
In a 2004 autobiography, Ali attributed his conversion to mainstream Sunni Islam to [[Warith Deen Muhammad]] who gained control of the Nation of Islam, upon the death of Elijah Muhammad, and persuaded the Nation's followers to become adherents of Sunni Islam.&lt;ref name = "Soul of a Butterfly 85"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Soul of a Butterfly|first1=Muhammad|last1=Ali|first2=Hana Yasmeen|last2=Ali|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|page = 85|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali had gone on the [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] in 1972, which inspired him in a similar manner to Malcolm X, meeting people of different colors from all over the world giving him a different outlook and greater [[Spirituality|spiritual]] awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.emel.com/article?id=109&amp;a_id=1722&amp;c=32|title=Muhammed Ali's Pilgrimage to Makkah|magazine=[[Emel (magazine)|Emel]]|issue=17|date=February 2006|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, he said that, after he retired, he would dedicate the rest of his life to getting "ready to meet God" by helping people, charitable causes, uniting people and helping to make peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2016/06/04/muhammad-ali-retirement-video/|title=Muhammad Ali had a thought-provoking response when asked about his retirement plans|website=[[Mashable]]|last=Bryan|first=Chloe|date=June 4, 2016|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on another Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in 1988.&lt;ref name="timesofindia"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rajeev|first=K R|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kozhikode/Muhammad-Alis-visit-was-Kozhikodes-knockout-moment/articleshow/52597630.cms|title=Muhammad Ali's visit was Kozhikode's knockout moment|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=June 5, 2016|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, he stated that "Islam is a religion of peace" and "does not promote [[terrorism]] or killing people", and that he was "angry that the world sees a certain group of Islam followers who caused this destruction, but they are not real Muslims. They are racist fanatics who call themselves Muslims". In December 2015, he stated that "True Muslims know that the ruthless violence of so-called Islamic [[jihadists]] goes against the very tenets of our religion", that "We as Muslims have to stand up to those who use Islam to advance their own personal agenda", and that "political leaders should use their position to bring understanding about the religion of Islam, and clarify that these misguided murderers have perverted people's views on what Islam really is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/06/muhammad-ali-face-real-islam-160606040559103.html|title=Muhammad Ali: The face of 'real Islam'|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=June 6, 2016|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later life, Ali developed an interest in [[Sufism]], which he referenced in his autobiography, ''[[The Soul of a Butterfly]]''.&lt;ref name="Soul of a Butterfly" /&gt; Around 2005, Ali converted to [[Sufism|Sufi Islam]] and announced that out of all Islamic sects, he felt most strongly inclined towards Sufism.&lt;ref name="CNN Lane 2016"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/04/28/sport/muhammad-ali-five-things-boxing/ |title=Muhammad Ali: Five things you never knew about the boxing legend |work=CNN |date=April 28, 2016|accessdate= November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="National Review Feb 2016"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/nrd/articles/431161/champ-and-mr-x |title=The Champ and Mr. X|work=National Review |date=February 29, 2016|accessdate= November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Beast June 2016"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/04/muhammad-ali-america-s-first-muslim-hero.html |title=Muhammad Ali: America's First Muslim Hero|work=Daily Beast |date=June 4, 2016|accessdate= November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph March 2016"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/boxing/2016/03/02/family-faith-and-magic-tricks-my-40-year-friendship-with-muhamma/ |title=Family, faith and magic tricks: My 40-year friendship with Muhammad Ali|work=The Telegraph |date=March 4, 2016|accessdate= December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ali's daughter, Hana Yasmeen Ali, who co-authored ''The Soul of a Butterfly'' with him, Ali was attracted to Sufism after reading the books of [[Inayat Khan]], which contain Sufi teachings.&lt;ref name="On Being June 2016"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.onbeing.org/blog/omid-safi-muhammad-ali-unapologetically-black-unapologetically-muslim/8735 |title=Muhammad Ali: Unapologetically Black, Unapologetically Muslim|work=[[On Being]] |date=June 9, 2016|accessdate= December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beliefnet Hana Yasmeen Ali interview"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/faiths/islam/2005/02/muhammad-alis-new-spiritual-quest.aspx? |title=Muhammad Ali's New Spiritual Quest|work=[[Beliefnet]] |accessdate= December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali later moved away from Inayat Khan's teachings of [[Universal Sufism]] after traditional Sunni-Sufis criticized the movement as being contrary to the actual teachings of Sunni Islam. Muhammad Ali received guidance from Sunni-Sufi Islamic scholars such as [[Grand Mufti of Syria]] Almarhum Asy-Syaikh [[Ahmed Kuftaro]], Shaykh [[Hisham Kabbani]], Imam [[Zaid Shakir]], Shaykh [[Hamza Yusuf]], and Dr. Timothy J.

On April 28, 1967, Ali appeared in Houston for his scheduled induction into the U.S. Armed Forces, but he refused three times to step forward when his name was called. An officer warned him that he was committing a felony punishable by five years in prison and a fine of $10,000. Once more, Ali refused to budge when his name was called, and he was arrested. Later that same day, the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] suspended his boxing license and stripped him of his title. Other boxing commissions followed suit.

At the trial on June 20, 1967, the jury found Ali guilty after only 21{{nbsp}}minutes of deliberation.&lt;ref name="greatath"/&gt; After a Court of Appeals upheld the conviction, the case was reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/403/698 ''C.

Ali remained free in the years between the Appellate Court decision and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling. As public opinion began turning people against the war and the Civil Rights Movement continued to gather momentum, Ali became a popular speaker at colleges and universities across the country; this itinerary was rare if not unprecedented for a prizefighter. At [[Howard University]], for example, he gave his popular "Black Is Best" speech to 4,000 cheering students and community intellectuals, after he was invited to speak by sociology professor [[Nathan Hare]] on behalf of the Black Power Committee, a student protest group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="The Greatest" Is Gone |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919377-5,00.html |page=5 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=February 27, 1978 |accessdate=August 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 1971, the Supreme Court of the United States in ''[[Clay v. United States]]'' overturned Ali's conviction by a unanimous 80 decision (Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] recused himself, as he had been the U.S. Solicitor General at the time of Ali's conviction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/403/698 |title=Cassius Marsellus CLAY, Jr. also known as Muhammad Ali, Petitioner, v. UNITED STATES. &amp;#124; LII / Legal Information Institute |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was not based on, nor did it address, the merits of Ali's claims per se; rather, the Court held that since the appeal board gave no reason for the denial of a conscientious objector exemption to Ali, and that it was therefore impossible to determine which of the three basic tests for conscientious objector status offered in the Justice Department's brief that the appeal board relied on, Ali's conviction must be reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1970-1979/1970/1970_783 |title=Clay v.

===Impact of Ali's draft refusal===
Ali's example inspired countless black Americans and others. ''The New York Times'' columnist [[William C. Rhoden|William Rhoden]] wrote, "Ali's actions changed my standard of what constituted an athlete's greatness. Possessing a killer jump shot or the ability to stop on a dime was no longer enough. What were you doing for the liberation of your people? What were you doing to help your country live up to the covenant of its founding principles?"&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

Recalling Ali's anti-war position, [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] said: "I remember the teachers at my high school didn't like Ali because he was so anti-establishment and he kind of thumbed his nose at authority and got away with it. The fact that he was proud to be a black man and that he had so much talent{{nbsp}}... made some people think that he was dangerous. But for those very reasons I enjoyed him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.wustl.edu/e/eii/eiiweb/abd5427.5952.001kareemabdul-jabbar.html |title=Interview with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar |publisher=Digital.wustl.edu |date=March 3, 1989 |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil rights figures came to believe that Ali had an energizing effect on the freedom movement as a whole. [[Al Sharpton]] spoke of his bravery at a time when there was still widespread support for the Vietnam War. "For the heavyweight champion of the world, who had achieved the highest level of athletic celebrity, to put all of that on the linethe money, the ability to get endorsementsto sacrifice all of that for a cause, gave a whole sense of legitimacy to the movement and the causes with young people that nothing else could have done. Even those who were assassinated, certainly lost their lives, but they didn't voluntarily do that. He knew he was going to jail and did it anyway. That's another level of leadership and sacrifice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muhammad Ali: The man who changed his sport and his country|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-36450806|publisher=BBC|date=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali was honored with the annual Martin Luther King Award in 1970 by civil rights leader [[Ralph Abernathy]], who called him "a living example of soul power, the [[March on Washington]] in two fists. [[Coretta Scott King]] added that Ali was "a champion of justice and peace and unity."&lt;ref name="Ezra82"/&gt;

In speaking of the cost on Ali's career of his refusal to be drafted, his trainer Angelo Dundee said, "One thing must be taken into account when talking about Ali: He was robbed of his best years, his prime years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/7470417/muhammad-ali-was-continues-greatest |title=Dundee: Ali was, still is 'The Greatest'|publisher=ESPN |date=January 17, 2012 |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali's resistance to the draft was covered in the 2013 documentary ''[[The Trials of Muhammad Ali]]''.&lt;ref name="Rapold"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/23/movies/trials-of-muhammad-ali-traces-alis-battle-over-vietnam.html|title=One of His Biggest Fights Was Outside of the Ring|last=Rapold|first=Nicolas|date=August 22, 2013|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NSA and FBI monitoring of Ali's communications===
In a secret operation code-named "[[Project MINARET|Minaret]]", the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) intercepted the communications of leading Americans, including Ali, Senators [[Frank Church]] and [[Howard Baker]], [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]], prominent U.S. journalists, and others who criticized the U.S. war in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/06/the-hidden-history-of-muhammad-ali/ |title=The Hidden History of Muhammad Ali |first=Dave |last=Zirin |work=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]] |date=June 4, 2016 |accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ed |last=Pilkington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/nsa-surveillance-anti-vietnam-muhammad-ali-mlk |title=Declassified NSA files show agency spied on Muhammad Ali and MLK |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 26, 2013 |accessdate=April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review by the NSA of the Minaret program concluded that it was "disreputable if not outright illegal".&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

In 1971, his [[Fight of the Century]] with Frazier provided cover for an activist group, the [[Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI]], to successfully pull off a burglary at an [[FBI]] office in [[Pennsylvania]], which exposed the [[COINTELPRO]] operations that included illegal spying on activists involved with the civil rights and anti-war movements. One of the COINTELPRO targets was Ali, which included the FBI gaining access to his records as far back as [[elementary school]]; one such record mentioned him loving [[art]] as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Medsger|first=Betty|url=https://theintercept.com/2016/06/06/in-1971-muhammad-ali-helped-undermine-the-fbis-illegal-spying-on-americans/|title=In 1971, Muhammad Ali Helped Undermine the FBI's Illegal Spying on Americans|work=[[The Intercept]]|date=June 6, 2016|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
In 1984, Ali was diagnosed with [[Parkinsonism|Parkinson's syndrome]], a disease that sometimes results from head trauma from violent physical activities such as boxing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/20/sports/change-in-drug-helps-ali-improve.html?sec=health |title=Change In Drug Helps Ali Improve |last=Thomas |first=Robert McG.

===Philanthropy, humanitarianism and politics===
Ali was known for being a [[humanitarian]]&lt;ref name="sky"&gt;{{cite news|title=Muhammad Ali Handed Humanitarian Honour|url=https://news.sky.com/story/muhammad-ali-handed-humanitarian-honour-10470033|work=[[Sky News]]|date=September 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[philanthropist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Tribute To Muhammad Ali: The Athlete, Philanthropist And Legend|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/tribute-muhammad-ali-athlete-philanthropist-legend|website=[[Odyssey (publication)|Odyssey]]|language=en-us|date=June 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reviews|first1=C.

Ali began visiting [[Africa]] starting in 1964, when he visited [[Ghana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-36469288|title=In pictures: Muhammad Ali's love affair with Africa|publisher=BBC News|date=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, he visited a [[Palestinian refugee]] camp in [[Southern Lebanon]], where Ali declared "support for the Palestinian struggle to liberate their homeland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Catron|first=Joe|url=https://www.mintpressnews.com/millions-mourn-death-muhammad-ali-black-palestinian-solidarity-championed-continues/216999/|title=Millions Mourn The Death Of Muhammad Ali As The Black-Palestinian Solidarity He Championed Continues|website=[[MintPress News]]|date=June 7, 2016|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thenation"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Zirin|first=Dave|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/andrew-cuomo-would-have-blacklisted-muhammad-ali/|title= Andrew Cuomo Would Have Blacklisted Muhammad Ali|magazine=[[The Nation]]|date=June 8, 2016|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, following his loss to Spinks and before winning the rematch, Ali visited [[Bangladesh]] and received [[honorary citizenship]] there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rahman|first=Mizan|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/story/497055/Muhammad-Ali-s-forgotten-land-in-Bangladesh|title=Muhammad Ali's forgotten land in Bangladesh|work=[[Gulf Times]]|date=June 6, 2016|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he participated in [[The Longest Walk]], a protest march in the United States in support of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] rights, along with singer [[Stevie Wonder]] and actor [[Marlon Brando]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/06/04/greatest-muhammad-ali-walks-164692|title='The Greatest' Muhammad Ali Walks On|publisher=[[Indian Country Today Media Network]]|last=Schilling|first=Vincent|date=June 4, 2016|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Ali was recruited by President [[Jimmy Carter]] for a diplomatic mission to Africa, in an effort to persuade a number of African governments to join the US-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] of the [[Moscow Olympics]] (in response to the [[Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan]]). According to Ali biographer Thomas Hauser, "at best, it was ill-conceived; at worst, a diplomatic disaster." The [[Tanzania]]n government was insulted that Carter had sent an athlete to discuss a serious political issue. One official asked whether the United States would "send [[Chris Evert]] to negotiate with London". Consequently, Ali was only received by the youth and culture minister, rather than President [[Julius Nyerere]]. Ali was unable to explain why the African countries should join the US boycott when it had failed to support the African boycott of the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]] (in protest at [[Apartheid]] in [[South Africa]]), and was unaware that the [[Soviet Union]] was sponsoring popular revolutionary movements in Africa. Ali conceded "They didnt tell me about that in America", and complained that Carter had sent him "around the world to take the whupping over American policies.&lt;ref name="Hauser 2004 p397"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hauser|2004|p=397}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nigeria]]n government also rebuffed him and confirmed that they would be participating in the Moscow games. Ali did, however, convince the government of [[Kenya]] to boycott the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cuddihy|first=Martin|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-09/muhummad-ali-is-remembered-by-africa/7495452|title=Muhammad Ali: Africa remembers the boxing legend|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)]]|date=June 9, 2016|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On January 19, 1981, in [[Los Angeles]], Ali talked a [[suicidal]] man down from jumping off a ninth-floor ledge, an event that made national news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1984, Ali announced his support for [[United States presidential election, 1984|the re-election]] of United States President [[Ronald Reagan]].

Around 1987, the California Bicentennial Foundation for the U.S. Constitution selected Ali to personify the vitality of the U.S. Constitution and [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. Ali rode on a float at the following year's [[Tournament of Roses Parade]], launching the U.S. Constitution's 200th birthday commemoration.&lt;ref name="Liberty"&gt;{{cite web|title=Muhammad Ali 2012 Liberty Medal Ceremony|url=https://constitutioncenter.org/calendar/muhammad-ali-2012-liberty-medal-ceremony|publisher=[[National Constitution Center]]|access-date=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, during the [[First Intifada]], Ali participated in a [[Chicago]] rally in support of [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]].&lt;ref name="thenation"/&gt; The same year, he visited [[Sudan]] to raise awareness about the plight of [[famine]] victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Khaled|first=Ali|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/sports/2016/06/04/How-Muhammad-Ali-became-a-sporting-hero-to-the-Arab-world.html|title=How Muhammad Ali became a sporting hero to the Arab world|publisher=[[Al Arabiya]]|date=June 4, 2016|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, he participated in an [[India]]n charity event with the [[Muslim Educational Society]] in [[Kozhikode]], [[Kerala]], along with [[Bollywood]] actor [[Dilip Kumar]].&lt;ref name="timesofindia"/&gt;

In 1990, Ali traveled to [[Iraq]] prior to the [[Gulf War]], and met with [[Saddam Hussein]] in an attempt to negotiate the release of American hostages.

Ali's bout with Parkinson's led to a gradual decline in his health, though he was still active into the early years of the millennium, promoting his own biopic, ''[[Ali (film)|Ali]]'', in 2001.

==Boxing style==
{{See also|Rope-a-dope}}
[[File:Muhammad Ali's boxing gloves.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ali's boxing gloves are preserved in the [[Smithsonian Institution]] [[National Museum of American History]].]]
Ali had a highly unorthodox boxing style for a heavyweight, epitomized by his catchphrase "float like a butterfly, sting like a bee". Never an overpowering puncher, Ali relied early in his career on his superior hand speed, superb reflexes and constant movement, dancing and circling opponents for most of the fight, holding his hands low and lashing out with a quick, cutting left jab that he threw from unpredictable angles. His footwork was so strong that it was extremely difficult for opponents to cut down the ring and corner Ali against the ropes. He was also able to quickly dodge punches with his head movement and footwork.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

One of Ali's greatest tricks was to make opponents overcommit by pulling straight backward from punches. Disciplined, world-class boxers chased Ali and threw themselves off balance attempting to hit him because he seemed to be an open target, only missing and leaving themselves exposed to Ali's counter punches, usually a chopping right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Slack |first=Jack |url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2013/1/24/3908574/muhammad-ali-boxing-technique-jack-slack |title=Pulling Back the Curtain on Muhammad Ali |publisher=Bloody Elbow |date=January 24, 2013 |accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slow motion replays show that this was precisely the way Sonny Liston was hit and apparently knocked out by Ali in their second fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxnGjKjxoo&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player |title=Muhammad Ali knockout Sonny Liston in Slow Motion HD |publisher=YouTube |date=October 30, 1974 |accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali often flaunted his movement by dancing the "Ali Shuffle", a sort of center-ring jig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quotedb.com/quotes/3980 |title=Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. by Muhammad Ali |publisher=Quotedb.com |accessdate=December 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali's early style was so unusual that he was initially discounted because he reminded boxing writers of a lightweight, and it was assumed he would be vulnerable to big hitters like Sonny Liston.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Jimmy Jacobs, who co-managed Mike Tyson, used a synchronizer to measure young Ali's punching speed versus Sugar Ray Robinson, a welter/middleweight who was considered pound-for-pound the best fighter in history. Ali was 25% faster than Robinson, even though Ali was 4550{{nbsp}}pounds heavier.&lt;ref name="Gallenger"&gt;Paul Gallenger, ''Sonny Liston''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ali's punches produced approximately 1,000{{nbsp}}pounds of force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Phillip |last=Starr| title =Martial Mechanics: Maximum Results with Minimum Effort in the Practice of Martial Arts| publisher =Blue Snake Books| year =2008| page =13| isbn =1583942114}}&lt;/ref&gt; "No matter what his opponents heard about him, they didn't realize how fast he was until they got in the ring with him", Jacobs said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Thomas |last=Hauser| title =Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times (Enhanced Edition)| publisher =Open Road Media| year =2012| page =&lt;!-- not numbered --&gt;| isbn =1453250638}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of Ali's punches was cumulative.&lt;!-- "Ali would rub you out", said Floyd Patterson. "He would hit you 14,000 times and he wouldn't knock you out, he rubbed you out."{{Cite quote| date=September 2014}}--&gt; [[Charlie Powell]], who fought Ali early in Ali's career and was knocked out in the third round, said: "When he first hit me I said to myself, 'I can take two of these to get one in myself.' But in a little while I found myself getting dizzier and dizzier every time he hit me. He throws punches so easily that you don't realize how much they hurt you until it's too late."&lt;ref name=Mee/&gt;

Commenting on fighting the young Ali, George Chuvalo said: "He was just so damn fast. When he was young, he moved his legs and hands at the same time. He threw his punches when he was in motion. He'd be out of punching range, and as he moved into range he'd already begun to throw the punch. So if you waited until he got into range to punch back, he beat you every time."&lt;ref name="Hauser 2004"/&gt;

Floyd Patterson said, "It's very hard to hit a moving target, and (Ali) moved all the time, with such grace, three minutes of every round for fifteen rounds. He never stopped. It was extraordinary."&lt;ref name="Hauser 2004"/&gt;

Darrell Foster, who trained Will Smith for the movie ''Ali'', said: "Ali's signature punches were the left jab and the overhand right. But there were at least six different ways Ali used to jab. One was a jab that Ali called the 'snake lick', like cobra striking that comes from the floor almost, really low down. Then there was Ali's rapid-fire jabthree to five jabs in succession rapidly fired at his opponents' eyes to create a blur in his face so he wouldn't be able to see the right hand coming behind it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,641739,00.html |title=How to...fight like Muhammad Ali |newspaper=The Observer |date=February 9, 2011 |accessdate=July 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opinion of many observers, Ali became a different fighter after the 3-year layoff. Ferdie Pacheco, Ali's corner physician, noted that he had lost his ability to move and dance as before.&lt;ref name="Hauser 2004"/&gt; This forced Ali to become more stationary and exchange punches more frequently, exposing him to more punishment while indirectly revealing his tremendous ability to take a punch. This physical change led in part to the "[[rope-a-dope]]" strategy, where Ali would lie back on the ropes, cover up to protect himself and conserve energy, and tempt opponents to punch themselves out. Ali often taunted opponents in the process and lashed back with sudden, unexpected combinations. The strategy was dramatically successful in the George Foreman fight, but less so in the first Joe Frazier bout when it was introduced.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Of his later career, Arthur Mercante said: "Ali knew all the tricks. He was the best fighter I ever saw in terms of clinching. Not only did he use it to rest, but he was big and strong and knew how to lean on opponents and push and shove and pull to tire them out. Ali was so smart. Most guys are just in there fighting, but Ali had a sense of everything that was happening, almost as though he was sitting at ringside analyzing the fight while he fought it."&lt;ref name="Hauser 2004"/&gt;

===Trash-talk===
Ali regularly taunted and baited his opponentsincluding Liston, Frazier, and Foremanbefore the fight and often during the bout itself. He said Frazier was "too dumb to be champion", that he would whip Liston "like his Daddy did", that Terrell was an "[[Uncle Tom]]" for refusing to call Ali by his name and continuing to call him Cassius Clay, and that Patterson was a "rabbit". In speaking of how Ali stoked Liston's anger and overconfidence before their first fight, one writer commented that "the most brilliant fight strategy in boxing history was devised by a teenager who had graduated 376 in a class of 391."&lt;ref name="Gallenger"/&gt;

Ali typically portrayed himself as the "people's champion" and his opponent as a tool of the (white) establishment (despite the fact that his entourage often had more white faces than his opponents'{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}). During the early part of his career, he built a reputation for predicting rounds in which he would finish opponents, often vowing to crawl across the ring or to leave the country if he lost the bout.&lt;ref name="greatath"/&gt; Ali adopted the latter practice from "Gorgeous" [[Gorgeous George|George Wagner]], a professional wrestling champion who drew thousands of fans to his matches as "the man you love to hate".&lt;ref name="greatath"/&gt; When Ali was 19, Wagner, who was in town to wrestle [[Freddie Blassie]] and had crossed paths with Clay,&lt;ref name=georgali /&gt; told the boxer before a bout with [[Duke Sabedong]] in Las Vegas,&lt;ref name=georgali /&gt; "A lot of people will pay to see someone shut your mouth. So keep on bragging, keep on sassing and always be outrageous."&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

ESPN columnist Ralph Wiley called Ali "The King of Trash Talk".&lt;ref name="ESPN Wiley"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wiley |first=Ralph |url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/wiley/010125.html |title=Jive trash talkin' |publisher=ESPN |date=September 13, 2001 |accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, ''The Guardian'' said Ali exemplified boxing's "golden age of [[Trash-talk|trash talking]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/28/boxing-trash-talk-david-haye |title=Boxing trash talk that stings like a bee |work=The Guardian |date=September 28, 2007 |accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bleacher Report]] called Clay's description of Sonny Liston smelling like a bear and his vow to donate him to a zoo after he beat him the greatest trash talk line in sports history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1238737-the-50-best-trash-talk-lines-in-sports-history/page/51 |title=The 50 Best Trash Talk Lines in Sports History |publisher=Bleacher Report |accessdate=September 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218114136/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1238737-the-50-best-trash-talk-lines-in-sports-history/page/51 |archivedate=December 18, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ali and his contemporaries==

===Ali and Frazier===

====Friendship====
In an interview published in 2002, [[Joe Frazier]] recalled that he had first met Ali around 1968. At this time Ali was continuing his legal fight to get his boxing license back, and Frazier was the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world. Frazier stated that he had campaigned vigorously for Ali to get his license; this included going to Washington and meeting the president to lobby on Ali's behalf. Frazier also lent Ali some money at this time.&lt;ref name = "Facing Ali 115-6"&gt;{{cite book|title=Facing Ali|first=Stephen|last=Brunt|authorlink=Stephen Brunt|publisher=The Lyons Press|pages = 115116|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dave Wolf, former sports editor of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' and a member of Frazier's entourage, Frazier was keen for Ali's return to boxing, because he believed that beating Ali would win him unambiguous acknowledgement as the "best".&lt;ref name="Hauser 217"/&gt; According to Wolf, Frazier was also kind to Ali during this timeagreeing to participate in staged confrontations, which enabled Ali to get publicity and earn money giving lectures. Wolf states that Frazier had deep respect for Ali's religious beliefs, and even participated in Muslim services at Ali's suggestion. Until Ali got "nasty" before their [[Fight of the Century|first fight]], Frazier endorsed Ali's refusal to be drafted; Wolf recalls: "I remember [Frazier] telling me, 'If Baptists weren't allowed to fight, I wouldn't fight either'."&lt;ref name="Hauser 217"&gt;{{cite book|title=Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times|first= Thomas|last=Hauser|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|page = 217|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali and Frazier knew they would become wealthy if Ali returned to the ring.&lt;ref name = "Facing Ali 116"&gt;{{cite book|title=Facing Ali|first=Stephen|last=Brunt|authorlink=Stephen Brunt|publisher=The Lyons Press|page=116|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Glory Years 162"&gt;{{cite book|title=Muhammad Ali: The Glory Years|first1=Felix|last1=Dennis|first2=Don|last2=Atyeo|publisher=Miramax Books|page = 162|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to their first fight, both had expressed a liking for each other.&lt;ref name = "Glory Years 180"/&gt; In 1970, Ali had stated: "Me and Joe Frazier will be buddies. I just want it to go down in history that I didn't sell out or [[Uncle Tom]] when I got famous, and I don't think Joe Frazier's going to do that either.

Ali and Frazier fought three fights in the span of five years; the first and third of these are widely regarded to be among the greatest of all boxing bouts, and the Ali-Frazier rivalry has been hailed as one of the greatest any sport has seen.&lt;ref name="Hauser 216"&gt;{{cite book|title=Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times|first=Thomas|last=Hauser|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|page = 216|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SI Nack"/&gt; Writing in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', William Nack commented: {{Quote|Of all the names joined forever in the annals of boxingfrom [[Jack Dempsey|Dempsey]]-[[Gene Tunney|Tunney]] to [[Joe Louis|Louis]]-[[Max Schmeling|Schmeling]], from [[Tony Zale|Zale]]-[[Rocky Graziano|Graziano]] to [[Sugar Ray Leonard|Leonard]]-[[Thomas Hearns|Hearns]]none are more fiercely bound by a hyphen than Ali-Frazier.

According to Ali,  Frazier's style of boxing made him a tougher opponent for him than Liston or Foreman because he was vulnerable to Frazier's in-close left [[Hook (boxing)|hook]]. Had he fought with Frazier before his three-and-half year break from boxing, when he was younger, "I'd have danced for fifteen rounds, and Joe wouldn't have ever caught me."&lt;ref name="Hauser 231"&gt;{{cite book|title=Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times|first= Thomas|last=Hauser|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|page = 231|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|{{Quote|[Frazier] was harder for me than Liston or Foreman, because he had what I was vulnerable toa good in-close left [[Hook (boxing)|hook]].

If I was young, I'd have danced for fifteen rounds, and Joe wouldn't have ever caught me. But the first time we fought, I was three-and-half years out of shape. |author=Muhammad Ali&lt;ref name="Hauser 231"/&gt;}}}}

After [[Thrilla in Manila]], Frazier called Ali "a great champion",&lt;ref name="SI Kram"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1975/10/13/613261/muhammad-ali-joe-frazier-thrilla-in-manilla |title='Lawdy, Lawdy He's Great' |work=Sports Illustrated |date=October 13, 1975|accessdate=October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, referring to Ali, graciously stated that "[m]y man fought a good fight";&lt;ref name="Aksyon"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/marcos-used-thrilla-in-manila-fight-as-distraction-from-filipinos-plight |title=Marcos used Thrilla in Manila fight as distraction from Filipinos' plight |work=Inter Aksyon |date=November 10, 2011 |accessdate=October 30, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003061025/http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/marcos-used-thrilla-in-manila-fight-as-distraction-from-filipinos-plight |archivedate=October 3, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Ali declared Frazier to be "the greatest fighter of all time next to me."&lt;ref name="Facing Ali 123"&gt;{{cite book|title=Facing Ali|first=Stephen|last=Brunt|authorlink=Stephen Brunt|publisher=The Lyons Press|page=123|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trash talk and altercations====
In the buildup to their three bouts, Ali called Frazier "dumb" and an "Uncle Tom" before their first fight, "ignorant" before the second, and a "gorilla" before the third.&lt;ref name="Guardian Hauser"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/sep/04/features.sport16 |title=The unforgiven |work=The Guardian |date=September 3, 2005|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Facing Ali 121"&gt;{{cite book|title=Facing Ali|first=Stephen|last=Brunt|authorlink=Stephen Brunt|publisher=The Lyons Press|page=121|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Felix Dennis|Dennis]] and Atyeo have noted that given Ali's warm words for Frazier in the past, his jibes about Frazier sounded hollow.&lt;ref name = "Glory Years 180"/&gt;

On January 23, 1974, five days before their [[Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier II|second fight]], Ali and Frazier had a public altercation captured on television. ABC Sports's [[Howard Cosell]] had arranged for the two to come to the studio to comment on their first fight. Things went smoothly until Frazier commented about Ali having to visit a hospital after the fight. Ali immediately responded by claiming he had gone to a hospital for ten minutes whereas Frazier had been hospitalized for three weeks after the fight,{{efn|According to Dave Wolf, the reason for Frazier's hospitalization was hypertension from which he had been suffering before the fight.&lt;ref name="Hauser 256"&gt;{{cite book|title=Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times|first=Thomas|last=Hauser|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|page = 256|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and concluded by calling Frazier "ignorant."&lt;ref name = "Glory Years 204"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hauser 255"&gt;{{cite book|title=Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times|first=Thomas|last=Hauser|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|page = 255|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frazier then snapped; removing his studio earplug, Frazier reached across to Ali protesting the usage of the word "ignorant".&lt;ref name="Hauser 256"&gt;{{cite book|title=Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times|first=Thomas|last=Hauser|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|page = 256|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Glory Years 204"/&gt; Soon the two were wrestling on the floor till they were separated by onlookers.&lt;ref name = "Glory Years 204"&gt;{{cite book|title=Muhammad Ali: The Glory Years|first1=Felix|last1=Dennis|first2=Don|last2=Atyeo|publisher=Miramax Books|page = 204|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hauser 256-57"&gt;{{cite book|title=Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times|first=Thomas|last=Hauser|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|pages = 25657|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[Larry Holmes]] commented that instead of letting Ali's words upset him, Frazier's response to Ali calling him ignorant should have been: 'Yeah, okay, I might be ignorant, but this ignorant man is going to kick your ass.'&lt;ref name = "Facing Ali 104"&gt;{{cite book|title=Facing Ali|first=Stephen|last=Brunt|authorlink=Stephen Brunt|publisher=The Lyons Press|page = 104|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to veteran boxing commentator Ronnie Nathanielsz, during the buildup to Thrilla in Manilla, Ali once awakened Frazier in the middle of the night by constantly screaming. When Frazier appeared on the balcony of his hotel room, Ali pointed a toy gun at him and shouted: "I am going to shoot you."&lt;ref name="Aksyon"/&gt;

Immediately after Thrilla in Manilla, Ali summoned Frazier's son [[Marvis Frazier|Marvis]] to his dressing room and apologized for the things he had said about Frazier.&lt;ref name = "Glory Years 244"/&gt;{{efn|{{Quote|Ali asked for me to come to his dressing room before any of the press arrived.

Lewis then conveyed this request to Frazier, but was told not to share it with Ali, according to Lewis.&lt;ref name="SI Nack"/&gt;

====Finale====
In 1988, Ali and Frazier joined Foreman, [[Larry Holmes]], and [[Ken Norton]] in Las Vegas for the making of the film ''Champions Forever''. At a local gym, Frazier came across Ali before a crowd of spectators, and said: "Look at Ali. Look what's happened to him. All your talkin', man. I'm faster than you are now. You're damaged goods."&lt;ref name="SI Nack"/&gt; Ali, already afflicted with Parkinson's, insisted that he remained faster than Frazier and pointing to a heavy bag suggested a contest of who can hit the bag the fastest. Frazier immediately took off his coat, and moving to the bag, threw a dozen rapid punches at it accompanied by loud grunts. Without removing his coat, Ali strolled towards the bag, held the ready stance, mimicked a Frazier grunt without throwing a punch, and then addressed Frazier with the words "Wanna see it again, Joe?"&lt;ref name="SI Nack"/&gt; Everyone laughed, except Frazier.&lt;ref name="SI Nack"/&gt;

Later that day, Frazier started walking towards Ali after having one drink too many. [[Thomas Hauser]], who was present, recalled that for the next 10 minutes Larry Holmes positioned himself between Ali and Frazier, preventing Frazier from reaching Ali. George Foreman then took over and acted as Ali's shield for the next 10 minutes. Throughout this incident, Ali remained oblivious to what was going on.&lt;ref name="SI Nack"/&gt;

In his 1996 autobiography, in which he always refers to Ali as Cassius Clay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Smokin' Joe: The Autobiography of a Heavyweight Champion of the World, Smokin' Joe Frazier|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-02-860847-1|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frazier wrote: {{Quote|Truth is, I'd like to rumble with that sucker [Ali] againbeat him up piece by piece and mail him back to Jesus.... Now people ask me if I feel bad for him, now that things aren't going so well for him. Nope. I don't. Fact is, I don't give a damn.

Commenting on Ali lighting the Olympic flame in 1996, Frazier stated that it would have been good if Ali had fallen into the cauldron after lighting the flame, and that he would have pushed Ali in himself if he had the chance to do so.&lt;ref name="SI Nack"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Facing Ali 102"&gt;{{cite book|title=Facing Ali|first=Stephen|last=Brunt|authorlink=Stephen Brunt|publisher=The Lyons Press|page = 102|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HC Jacobs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.courant.com/2011-11-08/sports/hc-jacobs-joe-frazier-column-1109-20111108_1_ali-s-parkinson-s-joe-frazier-muhammad-ali |title=Hoping Joe Frazier Actually Forgave Muhammad Ali |work=Hartford Courant|date= November 8, 2011|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a press conference held on July 30, 1996, Frazier accused Ali of being a "draft dodger", and a racist;{{efn|In the 1996 press conference, Frazier stated that "[Ali] didn't like his white brothers."&lt;ref name="SI Nack"/&gt; Prior to their first fight, Frazier had questioned Ali's commitment to blacks, given "a lot of guys around him are white."&lt;ref name = "Glory Years 180"&gt;{{cite book|title=Muhammad Ali: The Glory Years|first1=Felix|last1=Dennis|first2=Don|last2=Atyeo|publisher=Miramax Books|page = 180|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and claimed he would have been a better choice to light the Olympic flame than Ali.&lt;ref name="SI Nack"/&gt; Also in 1996, Frazier claimed Ali was suffering from "Joe Frazier-itis" and "left-hook-itis".&lt;ref name="SI Nack"/&gt;

In a 1997 interview, Frazier expressed no regret for the words he had used for Ali at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. According to Frazier: {{Quote|We weren't animals. We were human beings. He called me a gorilla. An Uncle Tom. Uncle Tom? I grew up so poor and so black in South Carolina, even the water we drank was colored. The only guy I 'tommed' for was him, giving in to him. God gave him so many gifts. Fast. Pretty. Smart. Strong. He didn't have to do what he did.&lt;ref name="HC Jacobs"/&gt;}}

In a 2001 interview with ''The New York Times'', Ali again apologized to Frazier for calling him names which, Ali claimed, was done to promote their fights. Frazier initially accepted the apology saying it was time to put this issue behind them.&lt;ref name="NYT Sandomir"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/15/sports/boxing-no-floating-no-stinging-ali-extends-hand-to-frazier.html |title=BOXING; No Floating, No Stinging: Ali Extends Hand to Frazier |work=The New York Times |date=March 15, 2001|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, subsequently Frazier commented that Ali should apologize directly to him instead of apologizing through a newspaper. Reacting to this, Ali stated: "If you see Frazier, you tell him he's still a gorilla."&lt;ref name="ESPN Sielski"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/classic/biography/s/Frazier_Joe.html |title=Frazier battled Ali in timeless trilogy |work=ESPN|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his interview in [[Stephen Brunt]]'s 2002 book [[Facing Ali (book)|''Facing Ali'']], Frazier, referring to how he had contributed to Ali's infirmity,  claimed he was sure Ali thinks of him whenever he gets out of bed, and that whatever Ali was undergoing was the will of God.&lt;ref name = "Facing Ali 102, 124"/&gt;{{efn|In his book, Brunt notes Frazier's struggle of revealing his genuine beliefs about Ali, and being savvy, because by now he had people looking after his commercial interests, and "somebody probably had a talk with him about image and public relations and how they relate to earning potential...Still, even the new, polished, packaged Frazier has his moments."&lt;ref name = "Facing Ali 102, 124"&gt;{{cite book|title=Facing Ali|first=Stephen|last=Brunt|authorlink=Stephen Brunt|publisher=The Lyons Press|pages = 102, 124|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a 2008 interview, Frazier stated he had forgiven Ali, but was unable to comment on whether Ali's present condition was due to divine punishment, as he had earlier stated, since "God works in a mysterious way."&lt;ref name="Telegraph Higginbotham"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3563084/Joe-Frazier-Still-Smokin-after-all-these-years.html |title=Joe Frazier: Still Smokin' after all these years |work=The Telegraph|date= November 11, 2008|accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, on the eve of the 40th anniversary of his first fight with Ali, and the year of his death, Frazier reiterated that he had forgiven Ali.&lt;ref name="HC Jacobs"/&gt;{{efn|In a column in the ''Hartford Courant'', published the day after Frazier's death, Jeff Jacobs wrote: "I hope Smokin' Joe did [forgave Ali].

==Entertainment career==
{{See|Muhammad Ali in media and popular culture}}

===Acting===
Ali had a cameo role in the 1962 film version of ''[[Requiem for a Heavyweight]]'', and during his exile, he starred in the short-lived Broadway musical, ''Buck White'' (1969).

Ali appeared in the documentary film ''[[Black Rodeo]]'' (1972) riding both a horse and a bull. His autobiography ''[[The Greatest: My Own Story]]'', written with Richard Durham, was published in 1975.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Ali|first1 = Muhammad | last2 = Durham| first2 = Richard| title = The Greatest: My Own Story| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EkfhAAAAMAAJ| date = October 1975| publisher = Random House| location = New York| isbn = 978-0-394-46268-4| oclc = 1622063 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 the book was adapted into a film called ''[[The Greatest (1977 film)|The Greatest]]'', in which Ali played himself and [[Ernest Borgnine]] played [[Angelo Dundee]].

The film ''[[Freedom Road]]'', made in 1978, features Muhammad Ali in a rare acting role as Gideon Jackson, a former slave and Union (American Civil War) soldier in 1870s Virginia, who gets elected to the U.S. Senate and battles other former slaves and white sharecroppers to keep the land they have tended all their lives.

===Spoken word poetry and rap music===
Ali often used [[rhyme scheme]]s and spoken word [[poetry]], both for when he was trash talking in boxing and as political poetry for his activism outside of boxing. He played a role in the shaping of the black poetic tradition, paving the way for [[The Last Poets]] in 1968, [[Gil Scott-Heron]] in 1970,  and the emergence of [[rap music]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="nytimes2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gates|first=Henry Louis Jr.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/09/opinion/muhammad-ali-the-political-poet.html|title=Muhammad Ali, the Political Poet|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 9, 2016|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', "Some have argued that" Ali was "the first [[rapper]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muhammad Ali's influence ran deep through rap's golden age|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jun/06/muhammad-ali-influence-rap-golden-age|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 6, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Ali released an album of [[spoken word]] music on Columbia Records titled ''[[I Am the Greatest (Cassius Clay album)|I Am the Greatest]]'', and in 1964, he recorded a [[cover version]] of the [[rhythm and blues]] song "[[Stand by Me (Ben E.

He later received a second Grammy nomination, for "Best Recording for Children", with his 1976 spoken word novelty record, ''[[The Adventures of Ali and His Gang vs. Mr. Tooth Decay]]''.&lt;ref name="rollingstone2"/&gt;

Ali was an influential figure in the world of [[hip hop music]]. As a "rhyming trickster", he was noted for his "funky delivery", "boasts", "comical trash talk", and "endless quotables".&lt;ref name="rollingstone1"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Reeves|first=Mosi|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/muhammad-ali-worlds-greatest-boxer-was-also-hip-hop-pioneer-20160604|title=Muhammad Ali: World's Greatest Boxer Was Also Hip-Hop Pioneer|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 4, 2016|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', his "[[Freestyle rap|freestyle]] skills" and his "rhymes, flow, and braggadocio" would "one day become typical of [[Old school hip hop|old school]] MCs" like [[RunD.M.C.]] and [[LL Cool J]], and his "outsized ego foreshadowed the vainglorious excesses of [[Kanye West]], while his [[Afrocentric]] consciousness and cutting honesty pointed forward to modern bards like [[Rakim]], [[Nas]], [[Jay-Z]], and [[Kendrick Lamar]]."&lt;ref name="rollingstone2"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Rubin|first=Mike|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/muhammad-ali-4-ways-he-changed-america-20160605|title=Muhammad Ali: 4 Ways He Changed America|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=June 5, 2016|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali has been cited as an inspiration by rappers such as LL Cool J,&lt;ref name="rollingstone1"/&gt; [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]'s [[Chuck D]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theundefeated.com/features/muhammad-ali-the-original-rapper/|title=Muhammad Ali: The original rapper  Legendary emcee Chuck D of Public Enemy talks Ali's impact on hip-hop|website=The Undefeated|date=June 9, 2016|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jay-Z, [[Eminem]], [[Sean Combs]], [[Slick Rick]], Nas and [[MC Lyte]].&lt;ref name="cbsnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jay-z-eminem-and-more-hip-hop-luminaries-remember-muhammad-ali/|title=Jay Z, Eminem and more hip-hop luminaries remember Muhammad Ali|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=June 9, 2016|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali has been referenced in a number of hip hop songs, including [[The Sugarhill Gang]]'s "[[Rapper's Delight]]", the [[Fugees]]' "[[Ready or Not (Fugees song)|Ready or Not]]", [[EPMD]]'s "You're a Customer" and [[Will Smith]]'s "[[Gettin' Jiggy wit It]]".&lt;ref name="cbsnews"/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Muhammad Ali and President Bush.jpg|right|thumb|As Mrs. Lonnie Ali looks on, President [[George W. Bush]] embraces Muhammad Ali after presenting him with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] on November 9, 2005, during ceremonies at the White House.]]
Muhammad Ali defeated every top heavyweight in his era, which has been called the golden age of heavyweight boxing. Ali was named "Fighter of the Year" by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine more times than any other fighter, and was involved in more ''Ring'' "Fight of the Year" bouts than any other fighter. He was an inductee into the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] and held wins over seven other Hall of Fame inductees. He was one of only three boxers to be named "[[Sportsman of the Year]]" by ''Sports Illustrated''.

In 1978, three years before Ali's permanent retirement, the [[Louisville Board of Aldermen]] in his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, voted 65 to rename Walnut Street to Muhammad Ali Boulevard. This was controversial at the time, as within a week 12 of the 70 street signs were stolen. Earlier that year, a committee of the [[Jefferson County Public Schools (Kentucky)|Jefferson County Public Schools]] (Kentucky) considered renaming Ali's alma mater, Central High School, in his honor, but the motion failed to pass. In time, Muhammad Ali Boulevardand Ali himselfcame to be well accepted in his hometown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bob |last=Hill |title=Ali stirs conflicting emotions in hometown |work=[[The Courier-Journal]] |date=November 19, 2005 |page=K5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the Associated Press reported that Ali was tied with [[Babe Ruth]] as the most recognized athlete, out of over 800 dead or living athletes, in America.

On November 19, 2005 (Ali's 19th wedding anniversary), the $60{{nbsp}}million non-profit [[Muhammad Ali Center]] opened in downtown Louisville.

[[Ali Mall]], located in [[Araneta Center]], Quezon City, Philippines, is named after him.

Ali was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' (UK TV series) in 1978 when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigredbook.info/muhammad_ali.html |title=Muhammad Ali's appearance on This Is Your Life |website=Big Red Book  Celebrating television's This Is Your Life|accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali was featured in ''[[Superman vs. Muhammad Ali]]'', a 1978 DC Comics comic book pitting the champ against the superhero. In 1979, Ali guest-starred as himself in an episode of the NBC sitcom ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.

He also wrote several best-selling books about his career, including ''[[The Greatest: My Own Story]]'' and ''[[The Soul of a Butterfly]]''. The Muhammad Ali Effect, named after Ali, is a term that came into use in psychology in the 1980s, as he stated in his autobiography ''[[The Greatest: My Own Story]]'': "I only said I was the greatest, not the smartest."&lt;ref name=cp /&gt; According to this effect, when people are asked to rate their intelligence and moral behavior in comparison to others, people will rate themselves as more moral, but not more intelligent than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allison |first1=Scott T.|last2=Messick|first2=David M.|last3=Goethals|first3=George R.|title=On Being Better but not Smarter than Others: The Muhammad Ali Effect|journal=Social Cognition|year=1989|volume=7|issue=3 |pages=275295|doi=10.1521/soco.1989.7.3.275|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Lange|first=P.

''[[When We Were Kings]]'', a 1996 documentary about the Rumble in the Jungle, won an [[Academy Award]],&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0118147|When We Were Kings (1996)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2001 biopic ''[[Ali (film)|Ali]]'' garnered an Oscar nomination for [[Will Smith]]'s portrayal of the lead role.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0248667|Ali (2001)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter film was directed by [[Michael Mann]], with mixed reviews, the positives given to Smith's portrayal of Ali. Prior to making the film, Smith rejected the role until Ali requested that he accept it. Smith said the first thing Ali told him was: "Man you're almost pretty enough to play me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1719162.stm |title=FILM, Will Smith peaks as Ali |publisher=BBC News |date=December 25, 2001 |accessdate=December 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pay-per-view bouts===
====Theatre television====
The earliest form of [[pay-per-view]] boxing telecasts was [[closed-circuit television]], also known as [[theatre television]], where fights were telecast live to a select number of venues, mostly theaters, where viewers paid for tickets to watch the fight live. The use of closed-circuit for boxing telecasts peaked in popularity with Ali in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="Ezra"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ezra|first=Michael|title=The Economic Civil Rights Movement: African Americans and the Struggle for Economic Power|date=2013|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9781136274756|page=105|chapter=Muhammad Ali's Main Bout: African American Economic Power and the World Heavyweight Title|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DL41bsCigZcC&amp;pg=PA105|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloodyelbow"&gt;{{cite news|title=History of Prizefighting's Biggest Money Fights|url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/8/24/16170894/history-of-prizefightings-biggest-money-fights-boxing-mma-ufc|work=[[Bloody Elbow]]|agency=[[SB Nation]]|date=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Ali's closed-circuit telecasts were handled by his promotion company Main Bout.&lt;ref name="Ezra105"/&gt; The following table lists known ticket sales/buys for Ali fights at closed-circuit venues/theaters:
