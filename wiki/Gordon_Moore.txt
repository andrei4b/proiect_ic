==Education==
Moore was born in San Francisco, California, and grew up in nearby [[Pescadero, California|Pescadero]]; his father was the county sheriff. He attended [[Sequoia High School (Redwood City, California)|Sequoia High School]] in [[Redwood City, California|Redwood City]].
Initially he went to [[San Jose State University]].&lt;ref name=IEEEHistory&gt;{{cite web|title=Gordon E. Moore|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Gordon_E._Moore|website=IEEE Global History Network|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After two years he transferred to the [[University of California, Berkeley]], from which he received a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in chemistry in 1950.&lt;ref name=CHFOralHistory/&gt;

In September 1950, Moore matriculated at the [[California Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=Seeding/&gt; Moore received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Gordon Earle|last=Moore |title=I.

==Scientific career==

===Fairchild Semiconductor Laboratory===
{{main|Traitorous eight}}
Moore joined MIT and Caltech alumnus [[William Shockley]] at the [[Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory]] division of [[Beckman Instruments]], but left with the "[[traitorous eight]]", when [[Sherman Fairchild]] agreed to back them and created the influential [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] corporation.&lt;ref name="accidental"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moore|first1=Gordon E.|title=The Accidental Entrepreneur|url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/3777/1/Moore.pdf|accessdate=January 8, 2015|work=Engineering &amp; Science|pages=2330|date=Summer 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BrockBook/&gt;

===Moore's law===
{{main|Moore's law}}
In 1965, Moore was working as the director of research and development (R&amp;D) at Fairchild Semiconductor. He was asked by [[Electronics (magazine)|Electronics Magazine]] to predict what was going to happen in the semiconductor components industry over the next ten years. In an article published on April 19, 1965, Moore observed that the number of components (transistors, resistors, diodes or capacitors)&lt;ref name=Moore1995 &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/CHE323/Moore1995.pdf |title=Lithography and the future of Moore's law |publisher=[[SPIE]] |author=Gordon E. Moore |year=1995 |accessdate=January 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a dense integrated circuit had doubled approximately every year, and speculated that it would continue to do so for at least the next ten years. In 1975, he revised the forecast rate to approximately every two years.&lt;ref name="Tuomi2002"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.5210/fm.v7i11.1000| title = The Lives and Death of Moore's Law| journal = First Monday| volume = 7| issue = 11| year = 2002| last1 = Tuomi | first1 = I. }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carver Mead]] popularized the phrase "Moore's law." The prediction has become a target for miniaturization in the semiconductor industry, and has had widespread impact in many areas of technological change.&lt;ref name=MooresLaw1965/&gt;&lt;ref name=BrockBook&gt;{{cite book

===Intel Corporation===
{{main|Intel}}
In July 1968, [[Robert Noyce]] and Moore founded NM Electronics which later became [[Intel Corporation]].&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Intel Corporation|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/289747/Intel-Corporation|publisher=[[Encyclopdia Britannica]]|accessdate=November 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yeh2004&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yeh|first1=Raymond T.|last2=Yeh|first2=Stephanie H.|title=The art of business : in the footsteps of giants|date=2004|publisher=Zero Time Pub.|location=Olathe, CO|isbn=978-0975427712|chapter=Intel: Leaping into the future with Moore's law|pages=7789|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5-m8tra8xKgC&amp;pg=PA77|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore served as [[executive vice president]] until 1975 when he became president. In April 1979, Moore became chairman and chief executive officer, holding that position until April 1987, when he became chairman. He was named chairman emeritus in 1997.&lt;ref name=HistoryMakers&gt;{{cite web|title=2004 History Maker - Gordon Moore|url=http://www.historysmc.org/main.php?page=hmmoore|website=History Makers|publisher=San Mateo County History Museum|accessdate=January 8, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114055933/http://www.historysmc.org/main.php?page=hmmoore|archivedate=January 14, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Noyce, Moore, and later [[Andrew Grove]], Intel has pioneered new technologies in the areas of [[computer memory]], [[integrated circuits]] and [[microprocessor]] design.&lt;ref name=Yeh2004/&gt;

==Philanthropy==
In 2000 Betty and Gordon Moore established the [[Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation]], with a gift worth about $5&amp;nbsp;billion. Through the Foundation, they initially targeted environmental conservation, science, and the San Francisco Bay Area.&lt;ref name=Carnegie2009/&gt;

The foundation gives extensively in the area of environmental conservation, supporting major projects in the Andes-Amazon Basin and the San Francisco Bay area, among others.&lt;ref name=InsidePhilanthropy&gt;{{cite web|title=Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation: Grants for Conservation|url=http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/grants-for-conservation/gordon-and-betty-moore-foundation-grants-for-conservation.html|website=Inside Philanthropy|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore was a director of [[Conservation International]] for some years. In 2002 he and Conservation International senior vice president Claude Gascon received the [[Order of the Golden Ark]] from [[Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld]] for their outstanding contributions to nature conservation.&lt;ref name=GoldenArk&gt;{{cite web|title=Intel's Gordon Moore and CI's Claude Gascon To Receive Major Award|url=http://www.conservation.org/NewsRoom/pressreleases/Pages/041902_gordon_moore_gascon_award.aspx|accessdate=January 8, 2015|website=Conservation International|date=April 19, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore has been a member of Caltech's board of trustees since 1983, chairing it from 1993 to 2000, and is now a life trustee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sally Ride, David Lee Named Caltech Trustees, Ben Rosen Named Trustee Chair |url=https://www.caltech.edu/content/sally-ride-david-lee-named-caltech-trustees-ben-rosen-named-trustee-chair |date=December 4, 2000 |accessdate=December 10, 2013 |publisher=[[Caltech]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.caltech.edu/content/technology-pioneer-gordon-moore-caltech-commencement-speaker |title=Technology Pioneer Gordon Moore is Caltech Commencement Speaker |date=May 3, 2001 |accessdate=December 10, 2013 |publisher=[[Caltech]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.caltech.edu/content/trustee-list |publisher=[[Caltech]] |accessdate=December 10, 2013 |title=Trustee List}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Moore and his wife donated $600&amp;nbsp;million to Caltech, at the time the largest gift ever to an institution of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/28/us/intel-founder-gives-600-million-to-caltech.html |work=[[New York Times]] |title=Intel Founder Gives $600 Million to Caltech |date=October 28, 2001 |accessdate=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that he wants the gift to be used to keep Caltech at the forefront of research and technology.&lt;ref name=Carnegie2009&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy Awarded to Michael R.

In December 2007, Moore and his wife donated $200&amp;nbsp;million to [[Caltech]] and the [[University of California]] for the construction of the [[Thirty Meter Telescope]] (TMT), expected to become the world's second largest optical telescope once it and the [[European Extremely Large Telescope]] are completed in the mid-[[2020s]]. The TMT will have a segmented mirror 30 meters across and be built on [[Mauna Kea]] in Hawaii. This mirror will be nearly three times the size of the current record holder, the [[Large Binocular Telescope]].&lt;ref name=SkyTelescope&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tytell|first1=David|title=Thirty Meter Telescope Moves Forward|journal=Sky &amp; Telescope|date=August 22, 2007|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/thirty-meter-telescope-moves-forward/|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Moores, as individuals and through their [[Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation|foundation]], have also, through a series of gifts and grants, given over $110 million to the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grants Search|url=https://www.moore.org/grants}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition, through the Foundation, Betty Moore has created the Betty Irene Moore Nursing Initiative, targeting nursing care in the San Francisco Bay Area and Greater Sacramento.&lt;ref name=Carnegie2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nursing&gt;{{cite web|title=Betty Irene Moore Nursing Initiative|url=http://www.moore.org/programs/patient-care/betty-irene-moore-nursing-initiative|website=Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation|accessdate=January 8, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224140317/http://www.moore.org/programs/patient-care/betty-irene-moore-nursing-initiative|archivedate=December 24, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, the foundation pledged $100 million over 11 years to establish a nursing school at the [[University of California, Davis]].&lt;ref name="Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grants Search|url=https://www.moore.org/grants}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Moore actively pursues and enjoys any type of fishing and has extensively traveled the world catching species from black marlin to rainbow trout. He has said his conservation efforts are partly inspired by his interest in fishing.&lt;ref name="charlierose"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/657|publisher=charlierose.com|title=Charlie Rose, November 14, 2005|accessdate=June 2, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802012627/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/657|archivedate=August 2, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Moore's genome was the first human genome sequenced on [[Ion Torrent]]'s [[Personal genomics|Personal Genome]] Machine platform, a massively parallel sequencing device, which uses field effect transistor sensors.&lt;ref name="mooreome"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rothberg | first1 = J.
