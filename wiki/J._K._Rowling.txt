Although she writes under the pen name J. K. Rowling, her name, before her remarriage, was Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that the target audience of young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman, her publishers asked that she use two initials rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose ''K'' (for Kathleen) as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Jo Rowling Interview on Oprah |url=http://www.oprah.com/showinfo/Harry-Potter-Phenom-JK-Rowling |accessdate=28 January 2012 |series=The Oprah Winfrey Show |serieslink=The Oprah Winfrey Show |airdate=2010-10-01 |time=1:50 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219121651/http://www.oprah.com/showinfo/Harry-Potter-Phenom-JK-Rowling |archivedate=19 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She calls herself Jo.&lt;ref&gt;Shelagh, Rogers (23 October 2000).

Rowling, her publishers, and [[Time Warner]], the owner of the rights to the [[Harry Potter films]], have taken numerous legal actions to protect their copyright.
