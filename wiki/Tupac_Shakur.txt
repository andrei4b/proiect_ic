Many people in Shakur's life were involved with the [[Black Liberation Army]]; some were convicted of serious criminal offenses and imprisoned, including his mother. His godfather, [[Geronimo Pratt|Elmer "Geronimo" Pratt]], a high-ranking [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]], had been convicted of murdering a school teacher during a 1968 robbery, although his sentence was later overturned. His stepfather, [[Mutulu Shakur]], spent four years at large on the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, 1980s|FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]] list, beginning in 1982. Mutulu was wanted for having helped his friend (no relation) [[Assata Shakur]] (also known as Joanne Chesimard), Tupac's godmother, to escape from a penitentiary in New Jersey in 1979. She had been imprisoned since 1977 for killing a [[State police|state trooper]] in 1973. She lived as a fugitive for several years before gaining asylum in Cuba in 1985. Mutulu was caught in 1986 and eventually convicted and sentenced to prison for the 1981 [[Brinks robbery (1981)|robbery of a Brinks armored truck]], during which two police officers and a guard were killed.&lt;ref name="labyrinth"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Labyrinth: A Detective Investigates the Murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G., the Implication of Death Row Records' Suge Knight, and the Origins of the Los Angeles Police Scandal |author=Sullivan, Randall|publisher=Grove Press|date=January 3, 2003|isbn=0-8021-3971-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakur had an older stepbrother, [[Mopreme Shakur|Mopreme "Komani" Shakur]], and a half-sister, Sekyiwa, two years his junior. Mopreme performed in many of his recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/stories/news/archive/2010/06/15/22267493.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618021222/http://www.allhiphop.com/stories/news/archive/2010/06/15/22267493.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 18, 2010 |title=Exclusive: Mopreme Shakur Talks Tupac; Rapper's B-Day Celebrated |publisher=[[AllHipHop|Allhiphop.com]] |accessdate=July 28, 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There he studied acting, poetry, [[jazz]], and ballet.&lt;ref name="King" /&gt; He performed in [[Shakespeare's plays|Shakespeare plays]] and in the role of the Mouse King in the ballet ''[[The Nutcracker]]''.&lt;ref name="labyrinth" /&gt; Shakur, accompanied by one of his friends, Dana "Mouse" Smith, as his [[beatbox]], won many rap competitions and was considered to be the best rapper in his school.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bastfield|2002|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was remembered as one of the most popular kids in his school because of his sense of humor, superior rapping skills, and ability to mix with all crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bastfield|2002|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakur developed a close friendship with [[Jada Pinkett Smith|Jada Pinkett]] (later Jada Pinkett Smith) that lasted until his death. In the documentary ''[[Tupac: Resurrection]],'' Shakur says, "Jada is my heart. She will be my friend for my whole life." Pinkett Smith calls him "one of my best friends. He was like a brother. It was beyond friendship for us.

===Move to California===
In 1988, Shakur and his family moved from Baltimore to [[Marin City, California]], a small unincorporated suburban community located {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} north of [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name="vibe" /&gt; He attended [[Tamalpais High School]] in nearby [[Mill Valley, California|Mill Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/16/us/shots-silence-angry-voice-sharpened-by-the-streets.html|title=Shots Silence Angry Voice Sharpened by the Streets |last=Marriott |first=Michel |author2=James Brooke |author3=Charlie LeDuff |author4=Donatella Lorch |date=September 16, 1996 |work=The New York Times |pages=A1 |accessdate=August 21, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825100514/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/16/us/shots-silence-angry-voice-sharpened-by-the-streets.html |archivedate=August 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakur contributed to the school's drama department by performing in several productions. In an English class, Shakur wrote a paper, "Conquering All Obstacles," in which he said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"our raps, not the sorry story raps everyone is so tired of. They are about what happens in the real world. Our goal is [to] have people relate to our raps, making it easier to see what really is happening out there.

He began attending the poetry classes of [[Leila Steinberg]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hearteducation.org/leila.html|title=Leila Steinberg|publisher=Assemblies in Motion|accessdate=January 25, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080213024039/http://www.hearteducation.org/leila.html |archivedate =February 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Steinberg organized a concert with Shakur's group, "Strictly Dope"; the concert led to his being signed with Atron Gregory. He set him up as a roadie and backup dancer with the hip hop group [[Digital Underground]] in 1990.&lt;ref name="TSTA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TSHSD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HTP-330" /&gt;

==Career==
===198793: Beginnings and rise to fame===
Before using his first name as his rap name, Shakur went by the alias MC New York when starting his career in Baltimore.
Although Shakur began recording in 1987, his professional entertainment career did not take off until the early 1990s when he debuted in Digital Underground's "Same Song" from the [[Nothing but Trouble (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the 1991 film ''[[Nothing but Trouble (1991 film)|Nothing but Trouble]]'', and also appeared with the group in the film. The song was later released as the lead song of the Digital Underground [[extended play]] (EP) ''[[This Is an EP Release]]'', the follow-up to their debut hit album ''[[Sex Packets]]''. Shakur appeared in the accompanying music video. After his rap debut, he performed with Digital Underground again on the album ''[[Sons of the P]]''. Shakur went on to feature Shock G and Money-B from Digital Underground in his track "[[I Get Around (Tupac Shakur song)|I Get Around]]", which ranked #11 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100.

In November 1991, Shakur released his debut solo album, ''[[2Pacalypse Now]]''. Though the album did not generate any hit singles, ''2Pacalypse Now'' has been acclaimed by many critics and fans for its underground feel, with many rappers such as [[Nas]], [[Eminem]], [[Game (rapper)|Game]], and [[Talib Kweli]] having pointed to it as inspiration.&lt;ref name="MTV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/h/hip_hop_week/2006/emcees/index15.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423100616/http://www.mtv.com/bands/h/hip_hop_week/2006/emcees/index15.jhtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 23, 2006 |title=MTV  They Told Us |accessdate=April 26, 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the album was originally released on [[Interscope Records]], the rights to its distribution are now owned by [[Amaru Entertainment]], the label owned by Shakur's mother. The album's name is a reference to the 1979 film ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''.

''2Pacalypse Now'' generated significant controversy for numerous reasons. The songs "Trapped" and "Brenda's Got a Baby" were widely noted for their poetic qualities but also offered strong critiques of unjust social policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vaught |first=Seneca |date=Spring 2014 |title=Tupac's Law: Incarceration, T.H.U.G.L.I.F.E., and the Crisis of Black Masculinity |journal=Spectrum: A Journal on Black Men |volume=2 |number=2 |pages=9394 |url=https://www.academia.edu/8258642/Tupacs_Law_Incarceration_and_the_Crisis_of_Black_Masculinity &lt;!-- alternate URL: http://muse.jhu.edu/article/540809 --&gt; |accessdate=June 28, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306233517/http://www.academia.edu/8258642/Tupacs_Law_Incarceration_and_the_Crisis_of_Black_Masculinity |archivedate=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Quayle]] criticized the album after a Texas youth's defense attorney claimed he was influenced by ''2Pacalypse Now'' and its theme of [[police brutality]] before shooting a state trooper. Quayle said, "There's no reason for a record like this to be released. It has no place in our society." Shakur stated that he felt he had been misunderstood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Philips |first=Chuck |title=I am not a gangsta |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-tupac-qa,0,5550948.story#axzz2j2YDkEWE |accessdate=October 30, 2013 |newspaper=LA Times |date=October 25, 1995 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027171106/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-tupac-qa%2C0%2C5550948.story |archivedate=October 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said, "I started out saying I was down for the young black male, you know, and that was gonna be my thang," Shakur said. "I just wanted to rap about things that affected young black males. When I said that, I didn't know that I was gonna tie myself down to just take all the blunts and hits for all the young black males, to be the media's kicking post for young black males.

On [[MTV]]'s Greatest Rappers of All Time list, ''2Pacalypse Now'' was listed as one of Shakur's "certified classic" albums, along with ''[[Me Against the World]]'', ''[[All Eyez on Me]]'' and ''[[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]]''. ''2Pacalypse Now'' went on to be certified Gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. It featured three singles: "[[Brenda's Got a Baby]]", "[[Trapped (2Pac song)|Trapped]]", and "[[If My Homie Calls]]".

His second studio album, ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...]]'', was released in February 1993. The album did better than its predecessor both critically and commercially, debuting at number 24 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The album contains many tracks emphasizing Shakur's political and social views, and there are noticeable differences in production from his first effort. While ''2Pacalypse Now'' had an indie-rap-oriented sound, ''Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...'' is generally considered Shakur's "breakout" album. It spawned the hits "[[Keep Ya Head Up]]" and "[[I Get Around (2Pac song)|I Get Around]]" and reached platinum status. On vinyl, Side A (tracks 18) was labeled the "Black Side" and Side B (tracks 916) the "Dark Side". It is Shakur's tenth-biggest selling album, with 1,366,000 units moved as of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlantapost.com/2010/09/16/tupacs-album-sales-and-his-persisting-legacy56988/ |title={{As written|Remebering}} Tupac: His Musical Legacy and His Top Selling Albums &amp;#124; Madame Noire &amp;#124; Black Women's Lifestyle Guide &amp;#124; Black Hair &amp;#124; Black Love |publisher=Atlantapost.com |accessdate=March 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220212220/http://atlantapost.com/2010/09/16/tupacs-album-sales-and-his-persisting-legacy56988/ |archivedate=February 20, 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1993, Shakur formed the group [[Thug Life]] with a number of his friends, including [[Big Syke]] (Tyruss Himes), Macadoshis (Diron Rivers), his stepbrother [[Mopreme Shakur]], and the Rated R (Walter Burns). The group released their only album ''[[Thug Life: Volume 1]]'' on September 26, 1994, which went gold. The album featured the single "Pour Out a Little Liquor", produced by [[Johnny "J"|Johnny "J" Jackson]], who went on to produce a large part of Shakur's album ''[[All Eyez on Me]]''. The group usually performed their concerts without Shakur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Thug Life: Vol. 1|date=1994|medium=CD}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was originally released by Shakur's label Out Da Gutta Records, though [[Amaru Entertainment]] has since gained the rights to it. Among the notable tracks are "Bury Me a G", "[[Cradle to the Grave]]", "Pour Out a Little Liquor" (which also appears on the soundtrack to the 1994 film ''[[Above the Rim]]''), "How Long Will They Mourn Me?" and "Str8 Ballin'". As a result of criticism of [[gangsta rap]] at the time, the original version of the album was scrapped and re-recorded with many of the original songs being cut. The album contains ten tracks because Interscope Records felt many of the other recorded songs were too controversial to release. Although the original version of the album was not completed, Shakur performed the planned first single from the album, "Out on Bail" at the 1994 Source Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiubB9awJUA |title=2Pac  Out On Bail (live 1994) |publisher=YouTube |date=January 8, 2007 |accessdate=March 12, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226224847/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiubB9awJUA |archivedate=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thug Life: Volume 1'' was certified Gold.

Shakur's third album, ''[[Me Against The World]]'', was released in March 1995 and was very well-received, with many calling it the magnum opus of his career.

==Other ventures==
===Death Row Records===
In October 1995, Shakur was released from prison after serving nine months of a sentence for sexual assault and formed a new group called [[Outlawz|Outlaw Immortalz]]. Shakur joined the Death Row label, under which he released the single "California Love".

On February 13, 1996, Shakur released his fourth solo album, ''[[All Eyez on Me]]''. This double album was the first and second of his three-album commitment to Death Row Records. It sold more than nine million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=All Eyez on Me [Vinyl] |url=https://www.amazon.com/All-Eyez-Me-Vinyl-2pac/dp/B00005AQE7 |title=Amazon.com states that it sold six million albums |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=February 25, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131223221550/http://www.amazon.com/All-Eyez-Me-Vinyl-2pac/dp/B00005AQE7 |archivedate=December 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record was a general departure from the introspective subject matter of ''Me Against the World'', being more oriented toward a thug and gangsta mentality. Shakur continued his recordings despite increasing problems at the Death Row label. [[Dr. Dre]] left his post as in-house producer to form his own label, [[Aftermath Entertainment|Aftermath]]. Shakur continued to produce hundreds of tracks during his time at Death Row, most of which would be released on his posthumous albums ''[[Still I Rise (2PAC album)|Still I Rise]]'', ''[[Until the End of Time (Tupac Shakur album)|Until the End of Time]]'', ''[[Better Dayz]]'', ''[[Loyal to the Game]]'' and ''[[Pac's Life]]''. He also began the process of recording an album, ''One Nation'', with the New York-based [[Boot Camp Clik]] and their label Duck Down Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/2Pac-Boot-Camp-Clik-One-Nation/release/2160632 |title=2Pac &amp; Boot Camp Clik  One Nation |publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=July 28, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731073304/http://www.discogs.com/2Pac-Boot-Camp-Clik-One-Nation/release/2160632 |archivedate=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 1996, he and Outlawz released the [[wikt:diss song|diss track]] "[[Hit 'Em Up]]", a scathing lyrical assault on [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] and others associated with him. In the track, Shakur claimed to have had sexual intercourse with [[Faith Evans]], the wife of Wallace, Shakur's former friend and rival, and attacked [[Bad Boy Records|Bad Boy]]'s street credibility. Shakur was convinced that some members associated with Bad Boy had known about the 1994 attack on him due to their behavior that night and the information that his sources gave to him. According to a 2005 interview with [[Jimmy Henchman]], in ''Vibe'' magazine, after the attack, Shakur immediately accused Henchman, an associate of Bad Boy CEO Sean Combs, of orchestrating the attack. Shakur, therefore, aligned himself with Suge, Death Row's CEO, who was already bitter toward Combs over a 1995 incident at the Platinum Club in Atlanta, Georgia, which culminated in the death of Jake Robles, the friend and bodyguard of [[Suge Knight]]; Knight was adamant in voicing his suspicions about Combs' involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Egbert |first=Bill |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2001/02/27/2001-02-27__hip_hype___rival_rap.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704173248/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2001/02/27/2001-02-27__hip_hype___rival_rap.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 4, 2010 |title=Hip Hype &amp; Rival Rap, by Bill Egbert |work=Daily News |location=New York |date=February 27, 2001 |accessdate=July 24, 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years following their killings, associates of both Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. made comments indicating the pair, were it not for their deaths, would have reconciled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1641700/tupac-and-biggie-would-have-reconciled-naughty-by-natures-treach-says/ |title=Tupac And Biggie Would Have Reconciled, Naughty By Nature's Treach Says |date=June 16, 2010 |first=Mawuse |last=Ziegbe |publisher=MTV |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101190821/http://www.mtv.com/news/1641700/tupac-and-biggie-would-have-reconciled-naughty-by-natures-treach-says/ |archivedate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.20015/title.lil-cease-says-tupac-and-notorious-b-i-g-would-have-ultimately-reconciled |title=Lil' Cease Says Tupac And Notorious B.I.G.

Collaborator [[Buckshot (rapper)|Buckshot]] claimed in 2015 that Shakur defended him against Suge Knight, who had insisted that the East Coast rapper could not come with him to [[Las Vegas]] on the grounds of the ongoing hip hop rivalry. Shakur asserted that he would not board the plane unless accompanied by Buckshot and was described by the fellow rapper as looking "discomforted" while they recorded a song together in a studio after Shakur "tore up the plane tickets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.32163/title.buckshot-recalls-tupac-defending-him-against-suge-knight |title=Buckshot Recalls Tupac Defending Him Against Suge Knight |date=January 18, 2015 |publisher=HipHopDX |first=Paul |last=Meara |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121004935/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.32163/title.buckshot-recalls-tupac-defending-him-against-suge-knight |archivedate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an August 15, 1996, appearance at the Brotherhood Crusade Rally, which featured several artists discussing the importance of voting, Shakur compared the sales of Death Row records to voters in the U.S. and the influence he and other artists had over an adoring fanbase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2015/08/26/tupac-snoop-talk-about-importance-of-voting-in-unearthed-1996-clip/ |title=Tupac &amp; Snoop Talk Voting Importance In Unearthed 1996 Clip |date=August 26, 2015 |publisher=ballerstatus.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222150322/http://www.ballerstatus.com/2015/08/26/tupac-snoop-talk-about-importance-of-voting-in-unearthed-1996-clip/ |archivedate=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thesource.com/2015/08/28/video-rare-footage-of-tupac-snoop-dogg-talking-about-the-importance-of-voting/ |title=[VIDEO] RARE FOOTAGE OF TUPAC &amp; SNOOP DOGG TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF VOTING |date=August 28, 2015 |publisher=The Source |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222134618/http://thesource.com/2015/08/28/video-rare-footage-of-tupac-snoop-dogg-talking-about-the-importance-of-voting/ |archivedate=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outlawz===
{{Main|Outlawz}}
When Shakur recorded "[[Hit 'Em Up]]", a [[Diss track|diss song]] toward Biggie, he recruited three members from the former group, Dramacydal, with whom he had worked previously and was eager to do so again. Shakur, with the three New Jersey rappers and other associates, formed the original lineup of the Outlawz. When 2Pac signed to [[Death Row Records|Death Row]] after his release from prison, he recruited step brother [[Mopreme Shakur]] and [[Big Syke]] from Thug Life. [[Hussein Fatal]], [[Napoleon (rapper)|Napoleon]], [[E.D.I. Mean]], [[Kastro (Outlawz)|Kastro]], [[Yaki Kadafi]], and Storm (the only female Outlaw) were also added, and together they formed the original lineup of the Outlaw Immortalz that debuted on 2Pac's Multi-Platinum smash ''[[All Eyez on Me]]''. They later dropped the Immortal part of their name after the untimely deaths of 2Pac and Yaki Kadafi and moved on as Outlawz without the members of Thug Life. [[Young Noble]] was later added and appeared on 2Pac's second Death Row release ''[[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]]''. It was on 2Pac's Makaveli album that Outlawz first came to the greater rap community's notice, appearing on a few songs.
The idea behind the group was for each member to have a rap name coinciding with the names of various tyrants or enemies of [[United States|America]], past, and present. Outlawz chose in later years to make a [[backronym]] out of the letters of their group name ''Operating Under Thug Laws as Warriorz'' although it does not stand for the group's name and is used infrequently.

On forming the Outlawz, Shakur gave each of them a name of a dictator/military leader or an enemy of America.

* [[E.D.I. Mean]], after Ugandan dictator [[Idi Amin]]
* [[Napoleon (rapper)|Napoleon]], after French military strategist and leader [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]

For himself, Shakur created the alias "Makaveli" from [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]] Italian philosopher and political theorist [[Niccol Machiavelli]], whose writings inspired Shakur in prison, but who also preached that a leader could eliminate his enemies by all means necessary. He mentioned Makaveli Records a few times before his death. This was supposed to be a music label for up-and-coming artists that Shakur had an interest in developing or potentially signing, and his own future projects would have been published through it as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2pacworld.co.uk/2pacCompanies.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050311080759/http://www.2pacworld.co.uk/2pacCompanies.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 11, 2005 |title=Makaveil Records |publisher=2pacworld.co.uk |accessdate=July 28, 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting career===
In addition to his endeavors in the music industry, Shakur acted in films. He made his first film appearance in ''[[Nothing but Trouble (1991 film)|Nothing but Trouble]]'' (1991), as part of a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] by the Digital Underground. His first starring role was in the 1992 film ''[[Juice (film)|Juice]]''. He played Roland Bishop, a violent member of the Wrecking Crew, for which he was hailed by ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s [[Peter Travers]] as "the film's most magnetic figure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alleyezonme.com/ |title=2Pac biography |publisher=Alleyezonme.com |accessdate=January 7, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114161717/http://www.alleyezonme.com/ |archivedate=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went on to star in ''[[Poetic Justice (film)|Poetic Justice]]'' (1993) opposite [[Janet Jackson]] and the basketball drama ''[[Above the Rim]]'' (1994). After his death, three more completed films featuring Shakur were released: ''[[Bullet (1996 film)|Bullet]]'' (1996), ''[[Gridlock'd]]'' (1997), and ''[[Gang Related]]'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,286619,00.html |title=Gridlock'd |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=July 28, 2010 |date=January 31, 1997 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307181059/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C286619%2C00.html |archivedate=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=gangrelated.htm |title=Gang Related |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=July 28, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904033649/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=gangrelated.htm |archivedate=September 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakur had been slated to star in the 1993 [[Hughes Brothers|Hughes brothers]]' film ''[[Menace II Society]]'' but was replaced by [[Larenz Tate]] after assaulting Allen Hughes as a result of a quarrel. Shakur reportedly wanted another type of role, but Hughes would not conform to his wishes, leading to the altercation between the pair which, according to [[Tyrin Turner]], also led members of Shakur's entourage to become physically aggressive toward Hughes. In 2013, Hughes said Shakur would have outshined the other actors had he been in the film, "because he was bigger than the movie." Hughes' comments were seen as validation that he had forgiven the rapper since the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/menace-ii-society-directors-explain-why-tupac-shakur-got-the-boot-from-their-gangsta-drama-classic-20130531 |title='Menace II Society' Directors Explain Why Tupac Shakur Got The Boot From Their Gangsta Drama Classic |first=Ken |last=Guidry |date=May 31, 2013 |publisher=indiewire.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101190821/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/menace-ii-society-directors-explain-why-tupac-shakur-got-the-boot-from-their-gangsta-drama-classic-20130531 |archivedate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1708225/menace-ii-society-tupac-shakur/ |title=Tupac Would Have Outshined Menace II Society, Director Admits |date=May 30, 2013 |first=Rob |last=Markman |publisher=MTV |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101190821/http://www.mtv.com/news/1708225/menace-ii-society-tupac-shakur/ |archivedate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Larenz Tate]], who had several rehearsals with Shakur before his part was recast, recalled Shakur being close to the Hughes brothers but that his actions were the result of "creative differences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.32947/title.larenz-tate-reflects-on-tupacs-rift-with-the-hughes-brothers |title=Larenz Tate Reflects On Tupac's Rift With The Hughes Brothers |date=March 13, 2015 |publisher=HipHopDX |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101190821/http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.32947/title.larenz-tate-reflects-on-tupacs-rift-with-the-hughes-brothers |archivedate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Director [[John Singleton]] mentioned that he wrote the script for his film ''[[Baby Boy (film)|Baby Boy]]'' with Shakur in mind for the lead role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Greg Tate |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0126,tate,25915,1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051101004728/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0126%2Ctate%2C25915%2C1.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 1, 2005 |title=Sex &amp; Negrocity by Greg Tate |publisher=Villagevoice.com |date=June 26, 2001 |accessdate=January 7, 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually filmed with [[Tyrese Gibson]] in his place and released in 2001, five years after Shakur's death. The film features a mural of Shakur in the protagonist's bedroom, as well as featuring the song "[[Hail Mary (2Pac song)|Hail Mary]]" in the film's score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rapbasement.com/hip-hop/god-bless-the-dead/2pac.html |title=FILM |publisher=rapbasement.com |accessdate=July 28, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825001905/http://www.rapbasement.com/hip-hop/god-bless-the-dead/2pac.html |archivedate=August 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistry==
Shakur's music and philosophy are rooted in many American, African-American, and world entities, including the Black Panther Party, [[black nationalism]], [[egalitarianism]], and liberty. Shakur's love of theater and [[Shakespeare]] also influenced his work. A student of the Baltimore School for the Arts where he studied theater, Shakur understood the Shakespearean psychology of inter-gang wars and inter-cultural conflict.

During a 1995 interview, Shakur said:&lt;ref name="Philips"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=Tupac Shakur: I am not a gangster|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-tupac-qa,0,5550948.story#|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=October 25, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[] I love Shakespeare. He wrote some of the rawest stories, man. I mean look at [[Romeo and Juliet]]. That's some serious ghetto shit. You got this guy [[Romeo Montague|Romeo]] from the [[Bloods]] who falls for [[Juliet Capulet|Juliet]], a female from the [[Crips]], and everybody in both gangs is against them. So they have to sneak out and they end up dead for nothing. Real tragic stuff. And look how Shakespeare busts it up with [[Macbeth]]. He creates a tale about this [[Lady Macbeth|king's wife]] who convinces a happy man to chase after her and kill her husband so he can take over the country. After he commits the murder, the dude starts having delusions just like in a [[Scarface (rapper)|Scarface]] song. I mean the king's wife just screws this guy's whole life up for nothing [...].&lt;ref name="Philips" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an interview in Spain, American music journalist [[Chuck Philips]] said that what impressed him the most about Shakur was that he was a poet.&lt;ref name="Interview with Philips about chuckphilpspost.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=Isabel|last=Garcia-Ajofrin |title=Entrevisa a Chuck Philips: "Ademas de lo de Tupac, Jimmy Henchman orderno disparar al trailer de Snoop Dogg" |url=http://www.swaggamusic.net/tag/chuck-philips/ |accessdate=September 25, 2012 |work=Swagga |date=September 25, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054440/http://www.swaggamusic.net/tag/chuck-philips/ |archivedate=September 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="English translation: Philips on Shakur"&gt;{{cite news|last=Garcia-ajofrin |first=Isabel |title=English translation of interview with Philips on Shakur |url=http://chuckphilipspost.com/reporters-archive/swagga/ |accessdate=September 22, 2013 |newspaper=Chuck Philips Post |date=September 25, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054813/http://chuckphilipspost.com/reporters-archive/swagga/ |archivedate=September 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philips said, "I like sacred texts, myths, proverbs, and scriptures. [...] When Tupac came along, I thought he was quite the poet [...] It wasn't just how cleverly they rhymed. It wasn't just the rhythm or the cadence. I liked their attitude. It was protest music in a way nobody had ever thought about before. [...]These artists were brave, wise and smart  wickedly smart. Tupac had so many sides. He was unafraid to write about his vulnerabilities."&lt;ref name="Interview with Philips about chuckphilpspost.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="English translation: Philips on Shakur" /&gt;

Shakur's debut album, ''2Pacalypse Now'' (1991), revealed his socially conscious side. On this album, Shakur attacked social injustice, poverty, and police brutality in "Brenda's Got a Baby", "Trapped", and "Part Time Mutha". On this initial release, Shakur helped extend the success of such rap groups as [[Boogie Down Productions]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[X-Clan]], and [[Grandmaster Flash]], as he became one of the first major socially conscious rappers from the West Coast.&lt;ref name=blackhistory.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackhistory.com/cgi-bin/blog.cgi?cid=52&amp;reading=1&amp;blog_id=60686 |title=Life After Death |publisher=blackhistory.com |accessdate=July 28, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708011918/http://www.blackhistory.com/cgi-bin/blog.cgi?cid=52&amp;reading=1&amp;blog_id=60686 |archivedate=July 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his second record, Shakur continued to rap about the social ills facing African Americans, with songs such as "The Streetz R Deathrow" and "Last Wordz". He also showed his compassionate side with the anthem "[[Keep Ya Head Up]]", while simultaneously putting his legendary aggressiveness on display with the title track from the album ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...]]'' He added a salute to his former group Digital Underground by including them on the playful track "[[I Get Around (2Pac song)|I Get Around]]". Throughout his career, Shakur expressed an increasingly aggressive attitude on his subsequent albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/2Pac/+wiki |title=Tupac Shakur Biography |publisher=[[Last.fm]] |accessdate=July 28, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904005820/http://www.last.fm/music/2Pac/%2Bwiki |archivedate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contradictory themes of social inequality and injustice, unbridled aggression, compassion, playfulness, and hope all continued to shape Shakur's work, as expressed in his incendiary 1995 album ''[[Me Against the World]]''. In 1996, Shakur released ''[[All Eyez on Me]]'', and many of the tracks are considered by critics to be classics, including "Ambitionz Az a Ridah", "[[I Ain't Mad at Cha]]", "[[California Love]]", "Life Goes On" and "Picture Me Rollin". Shakur described ''All Eyez on Me'' as a celebration of life, and the album was critically and commercially successful.&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r231489|pure_url=yes}}|title=All Eyez on Me|publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
Shakur had enjoyed and had been influenced by the work of contemporary English and Irish pop musicians as a teenager such as [[Kate Bush]], [[Culture Club]], [[Sinad O'Connor]], and [[U2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Carrie|last=Golus|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VndZuYv9u4kC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=tupac+kate+bush#v=onepage&amp;q=tupac%20kate%20bush&amp;f=false |title=Tupac Shakur|publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=December 28, 2006 |accessdate=March 29, 2012|isbn=9780822566090}}&lt;/ref&gt; His style on ''2Pacalypse Now'' was highly influenced by the social consciousness and [[Afrocentrism]] pervading hip-hop in the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Preezy|last=Brown|url=https://www.vibe.com/2016/11/tupac-2pacalypse-now-anniversary/|title=How 2Pacalypse Now Marked The Birth Of A Rap Revolutionary|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=November 12, 2016|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''All Eyez on Me'' was a change of style from his earlier works; while still containing socially conscious songs and themes, this album was heavily influenced by party tracks and tended to have a more "feel good" vibe than his earlier albums.&lt;ref name=allmusic /&gt;

==Personal life==
Shakur never professed to follow a particular religion, but his lyrics in singles such as "[[Ghetto Gospel]]" and "Only God Can Judge Me" and poems such as ''[[The Rose That Grew from Concrete (poetry collection)]]'' suggest he believed in God. Many analysts currently describe him as a [[Deism|deist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/vol14is2/nisker.pdf |title=Only God Can Judge Me and lyrical Subversion |format=PDF |accessdate=October 14, 2010 |author=Josh Nisker |journal=The Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture |volume=14 |issue=2 |year=2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601084958/http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/vol14is2/nisker.pdf |archivedate=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed in [[Karma]] but rejected a literal [[afterlife]] and organized religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside the Mind of Shakur |url=http://www.streetgangs.com/topics/tupac/060196tsinterivew.html |website=Streetgangs |publisher=Vibeonline |accessdate=December 31, 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120911045223/http://www.streetgangs.com/topics/tupac/060196tsinterivew.html |archivedate=September 11, 2012 |date=June 1996 |quote=I believe that everything you do bad comes back to you ...

Shakur had several family members who were members of the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]]: [[Mutulu Shakur]], his step-father; [[Assata Shakur]], his step-aunt; Billy Garland, his biological father; and [[Afeni Shakur]], his mother.

His father Billy Garland said Shakur's anger developed from his frustrations in being misunderstood. He particularly reacted when people questioned his commitment to the black community and the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sohh.com/2pacs-father-speaks-out-on-sons-anger-he-would-get-so-upset-when-people-tried-to/ |title=2PACS FATHER SPEAKS OUT ON SONS ANGER, "HE WOULD GET SO UPSET WHEN PEOPLE TRIED TO" |date=August 3, 2011 |publisher=sohh.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611013620/http://www.sohh.com/2pacs-father-speaks-out-on-sons-anger-he-would-get-so-upset-when-people-tried-to/ |archivedate=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his longtime bodyguard and friend Frank Alexander, Shakur's favorite color was green. He wore a green tank-top on the night of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Mxttty|title=Tupac Shakur - Final 24 Hours|date=May 15, 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEQKfuNNnr8|accessdate=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakur was dating and lived with [[Kidada Jones]], daughter of [[Quincy Jones]] and actress [[Peggy Lipton]], for several months until his death.  The couple told his mother, [[Afeni Shakur]], that they were engaged to be married and talking of having a baby in the near future.  Jones was waiting for Shakur in their Las Vegas hotel room when she was notified that he was shot. She rushed to the hospital and was with him when he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Vanity Fair|last=Anson|first=Robert Sam|title=To Die Like A Gangsta&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
In October 1991, Shakur filed a $10-million civil suit against the [[Oakland Police Department]], alleging that the police brutally beat him for [[jaywalking]]. Shakur received approximately $43,000 in settlement money, much of which went to pay his lawyer.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/14/arts/tupac-shakur-25-rap-performer-who-personified-violence-dies.html?pagewanted=2 |work=The New York Times |title=Tupac Shakur, 25, Rap Performer Who Personified Violence, Dies |first=Jon |last=Pareles |date=September 14, 1996 |accessdate=May 26, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021051509/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/14/arts/tupac-shakur-25-rap-performer-who-personified-violence-dies.html?pagewanted=2 |archivedate=October 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 22, 1992, in Marin City, Shakur performed at an outdoor festival and stayed for an hour afterward signing autographs and pictures. A confrontation occurred and Shakur drew a legally registered [[Colt Mustang]], and allegedly dropped it. As it was picked up by a member of his entourage, a bullet was discharged. About {{convert|100|yd|m|-1}} away, Qa'id Walker-Teal, a 6-year-old boy, was riding his bicycle at a school playground nearby when he was fatally struck by a bullet in the forehead, killing him. Although the police matched the bullet to a .38-caliber pistol registered to Shakur, and although his stepbrother, Maurice Harding, was initially arrested on suspicion of firing the weapon, no charges were filed. Marin County prosecutors have said they were stymied by a lack of witnesses. In 1995, a [[Wrongful death claim|wrongful death suit]] was brought against Shakur by Qa'id's mother. The defense attorney acknowledged that the bullet that killed Qa'id was traced by authorities to a gun registered to Shakur. The suit was dropped when Shakur agreed to pay a $300,000$500,000 settlement to the parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Marin-slaying-case-against-rapper-opens-3122665.php|title=Marin slaying case against rapper opens |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=November 3, 1995 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412011323/http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Marin-slaying-case-against-rapper-opens-3122665.php |archivedate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Settlement in Rapper's Trial for Boy's Death |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=November 8, 1995 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/PAGE-ONE-Settlement-in-Rapper-s-Trial-For-3019996.php |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513061224/http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/PAGE-ONE-Settlement-in-Rapper-s-Trial-For-3019996.php |archivedate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 5, 1993, Shakur was charged with one count of felonious assault. He was accused of attempting to hit rapper Chauncey Wynn from the group M.A.D. with a baseball bat at a concert at [[Michigan State University]]. The incident reportedly began when Shakur became angry and threw a microphone. Shakur pleaded guilty on September 14, 1994, to a misdemeanor in exchange for the dismissal of the felonious-assault charge. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail, 20 of which were suspended, and ordered to perform 35 hours of community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rapper Tupac Shakur to face assault charge|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19940909&amp;id=C0xIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xg4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4115,3582492|accessdate=August 27, 2013|newspaper=Ocala Star-Banner|date=September 9, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rapper sentenced for assault|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1988&amp;dat=19941101&amp;id=n0AoAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YwUGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3900,36494|accessdate=August 27, 2013|newspaper=The Argus|date=November 1, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1993, in [[Atlanta]], two brothers and off-duty police officers, Mark and Scott Whitwell, were with their wives celebrating Mrs. Whitwell's passing of the state bar examination. The officers were drunk and in possession of stolen guns. As they crossed the street, a car with Shakur inside passed them or "almost struck them". The Whitwells argued with the driver, Shakur, and the other passengers, who were joined by a second passing car. Shakur shot one officer in the buttocks and the other in the leg, back, or abdomen, according to varying news reports. Mark Whitwell was charged with firing at Shakur's car and later lying to the police during the investigation. Shakur was charged with the shooting. Prosecutors dropped all charges against the parties.&lt;ref&gt;Smothers, R., [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DC1F3AF931A35752C1A965958260 "Rapper Charged in Shootings of Off-Duty Officers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224152447/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DC1F3AF931A35752C1A965958260 |date=February 24, 2009}}.

===Rape case===
In November 1993, Shakur and others were charged with [[sexual assault]]ing a woman in a hotel room. Shakur denied the charges. According to Shakur, he had prior relations days earlier with the woman that were consensual (the woman admitted she performed [[oral sex]] on Shakur). The complainant claimed sexual assault after her second visit to Shakur's hotel room; she alleged that Shakur and his entourage [[gang rape|rape]]d her. At trial, Shakur was convicted of first-degree sexual abuse, and acquitted of the weapons and [[sodomy]] charges.

===Prison sentence===
Shakur began serving his prison sentence on sexual-assault charges at [[Clinton Correctional Facility]] on February 14, 1995. Shortly afterward, he released his Multi-Platinum album ''[[Me Against the World]]''. Shakur became the first artist to have an album at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] while serving a prison sentence. ''Me Against the World'' made its debut on the ''Billboard'' 200 and stayed at the top of the charts for four weeks. The album sold 240,000 copies in its first week, setting a record for highest first-week sales for a solo male rap artist at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3734910.stm |title=Timeline: 25 Years of Rap Records |publisher=BBC News |date=October 11, 2004 |accessdate=January 7, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330160559/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3734910.stm |archivedate=March 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While serving his sentence, Shakur married his long-time girlfriend, Keisha Morris, on April 4, 1995; the couple divorced in 1996. Shakur stated that he married her "for the wrong reasons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tupac-online.com/News/0-259493-00.html |title=Tupac's Ex-Wife Does Interview |publisher=Tupac-online.com |accessdate=July 24, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806032922/http://www.tupac-online.com/news/0-259493-00.html |archivedate=August 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview after his release, Shakur claimed to have written only one song during his sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.30209/title.tupac-shakur-says-he-wrote-only-one-song-in-jail-in-post-prison-interview-from-1995 |title=Tupac Shakur Says He "Wrote Only One Song In Jail" In Post-Prison Interview From 1995 |date=August 13, 2014 |publisher=hiphopdx.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505022833/http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.30209/title.tupac-shakur-says-he-wrote-only-one-song-in-jail-in-post-prison-interview-from-1995 |archivedate=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While imprisoned, Shakur became interested in [[philosophy]], [[philosophy of war]], and [[military strategy]] by studying the works such as ''[[The Prince]]'' by Italian philosopher [[Niccol Machiavelli]] and ''[[The Art of War]]'' by Chinese military strategist [[Sun Tzu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Wagner James |last=Au |title=Yo, Niccolo! |url=http://archive.salon.com/media/media2961211.html |work=[[Salon.com|Salon]] |publisher=Salon Media Group Inc.|location=San Francisco, California|accessdate=December 31, 2016 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070929103156/http://archive.salon.com/media/media2961211.html |dead-url=yes |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |date=December 11, 1996 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works inspired his pseudonym "Makaveli", under which he released the album ''[[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]]''. The album presents a stark contrast to previous works. Throughout the album, Shakur continues to focus on the themes of pain and aggression, making this album one of the emotionally darker works of his career.

While in prison, Shakur wrote to Death Row Uncut director Nina Bhadresher about his plans to begin a "new chapter" of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Rebecca|last=Pocklington|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/tupac-shakur-wrote-starting-new-6578812 |title=Tupac Shakur wrote about starting a 'new chapter' in handwritten letter from jail, now selling for $225,000 |date=October 5, 2015 |work=mirror.co.uk| publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|location=London, England|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430072601/http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/tupac-shakur-wrote-starting-new-6578812 |archivedate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Kevin Powell]], who spoke to Shakur following his release from prison, the performer "seemed like a completely transformed person."

On the night of September 7, 1996, Shakur attended the [[Bruce Seldon vs. Mike Tyson]] boxing match with [[Suge Knight]] at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] in Las Vegas, Nevada. After leaving the match, one of Knight's associates spotted [[Orlando Anderson|Orlando "Baby Lane" Anderson]], an alleged [[Crips]] gang member from [[Compton, California]], in the MGM Grand lobby. Earlier that year, Anderson and a group of Crips had robbed a member of Death Row's entourage in a [[Foot Locker]] store. Knight's associate told Shakur, who attacked Anderson, assisted by his and Knight's entourage. The fight was captured on the hotel's [[Closed-circuit television|video surveillance]]. After the brawl, Shakur went with Knight to Death Rowowned Club 662. Shakur rode in Knight's 1996 black [[BMW E38|BMW 750iL]] sedan as part of a larger convoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madeira.hccanet.org/project1/seiden1/death.html |title=September 1996 Shooting and Death |publisher=madeira.hccanet.org |accessdate=July 28, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726142741/http://madeira.hccanet.org/project1/seiden1/death.html |archivedate=July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 11:00&amp;ndash;11:05&amp;nbsp;p.m. ([[Pacific Time Zone|PDT]]), they were halted on Las Vegas Boulevard by Metro bicycle police for playing the car stereo too loudly and not having license plates.

After arriving at the scene, police and paramedics took Knight and the wounded Shakur to the [[University Medical Center of Southern Nevada]].

His fifth album, ''[[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]]'', was released two months later, along with numerous other posthumous albums.

===Aftermath===
In 2002, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published a two-part story by investigative reporter [[Chuck Philips]], titled "Who Killed Tupac Shakur?",&lt;ref name="Philips: Who killed Tupac Shakur"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Chuck |last=Philips |title=Who Killed Tupac Shakur? |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/sep/06/business/fi-tupac6 |accessdate=July 15, 2012 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=September 6, 2002 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109234606/http://articles.latimes.com/2002/sep/06/business/fi-tupac6 |archivedate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Who killed Tupac Shakur Part 2"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Chuck| last=Philips |title=Who killed Tupac Shakur?:Part 2 |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-fi-tupac7sep07,0,6002100.story |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=September 7, 2002 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318222341/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-fi-tupac7sep07%2C0%2C6002100.story |archivedate=March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on yearlong research that reconstructed the crime and the events leading up to it. Information gathered by the paper indicated that: "the shooting was carried out by a Compton gang called the Southside Crips to avenge the beating of one of its members by Shakur a few hours earlier. Orlando Anderson, the Crip whom Shakur had attacked, fired the fatal shots. Las Vegas police discounted Anderson as a suspect and interviewed him only once, briefly. He was later killed in an unrelated gang shooting." The article also reported the involvement of East Coast rapper [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], Shakur's rival at the time, and several New York criminals.

Before they died, The Notorious B.I.G. and Anderson denied any role in the murder. In support of their claims, Biggie's family produced computerized invoices suggesting that he was working in a New York recording studio the night of the drive-by shooting. His manager Wayne Barrow and fellow rapper [[Lil' Cease]] (James Lloyd) made public announcements denying Biggie's role in the crime and claimed further that they were with him in the recording studio the night of the event.&lt;ref name="streetgangs1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetgangs.com/topics/tupac/090602aliby.html |archive-url=http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20030211184526/http://www.streetgangs.com/topics/tupac/090602aliby.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 11, 2003 |title=Notorious B.I.G.'s Family 'Outraged' By Tupac Article |publisher=Streetgangs.com |accessdate=July 28, 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'' called the evidence "inconclusive", noting:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The pages purport to be three computer printouts from Daddy's House, indicating that Wallace was in the studio recording a song called ''Nasty Boy'' on the afternoon Shakur was shot. They indicate that Wallace ''wrote half the session'', was ''In and out/sat around'' and ''laid down a ref'', shorthand for a reference vocal, the equivalent of a first take. But nothing indicates when the documents were created. And Louis Alfred, the recording engineer listed on the sheets, said in an interview that he remembered recording the song with Wallace in a late-night session, not during the day. He could not recall the date of the session but said it was likely not the night Shakur was shot. 'We would have heard about it,' Mr. Alfred said."&lt;ref name="New York Times on New Revelations"&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Leland |title=New Theories Stir Speculation On Rap Deaths |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/07/arts/new-theories-stir-speculation-on-rap-deaths.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm  |work=[[New York Times]] |publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|accessdate=September 29, 2013|date=October 7, 2002 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002202518/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/07/arts/new-theories-stir-speculation-on-rap-deaths.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |archivedate=October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chuck Philips]] writes that "the slaying [of Tupac Shakur] silenced one of modern music's most eloquent voicesa ghetto poet whose tales of urban alienation captivated young people of all races and backgrounds. The 25-year-old Shakur had helped elevate rap from a crude street fad to a complex art form, setting the stage for the current global hip-hop phenomenon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-fi-tupac6sep06-story.html |title=Who killed Tupac Shakur? |website=latimes.com |accessdate=March 26, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312042845/http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-fi-tupac6sep06-story.html |archivedate=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To preserve Shakur's legacy, his mother founded the Shakur Family Foundation (later renamed the Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation or TASF) in 1997. The TASF's stated mission is to "provide training and support for students who aspire to enhance their creative talents." The TASF sponsors essay contests, charity events, a [[performing arts]] day camp for teenagers and undergraduate scholarships. The Foundation officially opened the [[Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts]] (TASCA) in [[Stone Mountain, Georgia|Stone Mountain]], Georgia, on June 11, 2005. On November 14, 2003, a documentary about Shakur entitled ''[[Tupac: Resurrection]]'' was released under the supervision of his mother and narrated entirely in his voice. It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Documentary Feature|Best Documentary]] at the [[77th Academy Awards|2005 Academy Awards]]. Proceeds will go to a charity set up by Shakur's mother Afeni. On April 17, 2003, [[Harvard University]] co-sponsored an academic symposium entitled "All Eyez on Me: Tupac Shakur and the Search for the Modern Folk Hero". The speakers discussed a wide range of topics dealing with Shakur's impact on everything from entertainment to sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Gewertz, K. "Symposium analyzes, celebrates 'Thug'".

Many of the speakers discussed Shakur's status and public persona, including [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]] English professor [[Mark Anthony Neal]] who gave the talk "Thug Nigga Intellectual: Tupac as Celebrity Gramscian" in which he argued that Shakur was an example of the "organic intellectual" expressing the concerns of a larger group.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, M. "Thug Nigga Intellectual: Tupac as Celebrity Gramscian".

Professor of Communications Murray Forman, of [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]], spoke of the [[mythical]] status about Shakur's life and death. He addressed the [[symbol]]ism and mythology surrounding Shakur's death in his talk entitled "Tupac Shakur: O.G. (Ostensibly Gone)". Among his findings were that Shakur's fans have "succeeded in resurrecting Tupac as an ethereal life force."&lt;ref&gt;Forman, M. "Tupac Shakur: O.G. (Ostensibly Gone)". [[Harvard University]]. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In "From Thug Life to Legend: Realization of a Black Folk Hero", Professor of Music at Northeastern University, Emmett Price, compared Shakur's public image to that of the trickster figures of African-American folklore which gave rise to the urban "bad-man" persona of the post-slavery period. He ultimately described Shakur as a "prolific artist" who was "driven by a terrible sense of urgency" in a quest to "unify mind, body, and spirit".&lt;ref&gt;Price, E. "From Thug Life to Legend: Realization of a Black Folk Hero". [[Harvard University]]. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2003, the [[Makaveli Branded Clothing]] line was launched by Afeni. In 2005, Death Row released ''[[Tupac: Live at the House of Blues]]''. The DVD was the final recorded performance of Shakur's career, which took place on July 4, 1996, and features a large number of Death Row artists.

[[BET]] named 2Pac 'The Most Influential Rappers of All Time'. They then went on to say "his confounding mixture of ladies' man, thug, revolutionary and poet has forever altered our perception of what a rapper should look like, sound like and act like. In [[50 Cent]], [[Ja Rule]], [[Lil Wayne]], newcomers like [[Freddie Gibbs]] and even his friend-turned-rival Biggie, it's easy to see that Pac is the most copied MC of all time. There are murals bearing his likeness in New York, Brazil, Sierra Leone, Bulgaria and countless other places; he even has statues in Atlanta and Germany. Quite simply, no other rapper has captured the world's attention the way Tupac did and still does."&lt;ref name="bet.com"/&gt;

===Biopic===
{{Main|All Eyez on Me (film)}}
[[Demetrius Shipp Jr.]] played Shakur in the biopic ''[[All Eyez on Me (film)|All Eyez on Me]]'', which started filming in [[Atlanta]] in December 2015. Music video director [[Benny Boom]] helmed ''All Eyez on Me'', which had been hamstrung by production problems. With distribution from Morgan Creek Productions, the film had been in development since 2013, with producers Randall Emmett and George Furla having sued Morgan Creek for $10 million, claiming breach-of-contract after the production company allegedly picked a lead, and set a budget and a production schedule without their approval. Morgan Creek also sued Afeni Shakur for the music rights for the film. Multiple directors were involved with the film before Boom, including [[John Singleton]] and [[Antoine Fuqua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vibe.com/2015/12/tupac-biopic-all-eyez-on-me-production-begun/ |title=The Production For Tupac's Biopic All Eyez On Me Has Finally Begun |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20161231132946/http://www.vibe.com/2015/12/tupac-biopic-all-eyez-on-me-production-begun/ |archivedate=December 31, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released on June 16, 2017, which would have been Shakur's 46th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/2016/11/tupac-all-eyez-on-me-release-date/|title=Tupac's Highly-Anticipated Biopic Receives Official Release Date|date=November 22, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received negative reviews.
