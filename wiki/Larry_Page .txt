During an interview, Page recalled his childhood, noting that his house "was usually a mess, with computers, science, and technology magazines and ''[[Popular Science]]'' magazines all over the place", an environment in which he immersed himself. Page was an avid reader during his youth, writing in his 2013 Google founders letter: "I remember spending a huge amount of time poring over books and magazines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Larry Page|title=2013 Founders' Letter|url=https://investor.google.com/corporate/2013/founders-letter.html|website=Google Investor Relations|publisher=Google|accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to writer Nicholas Carlson, the combined influence of Page's home atmosphere and his attentive parents "fostered creativity and invention". Page also played [[saxophone]] and studied [[music composition]] while growing up. Page has mentioned that his musical education inspired his impatience and obsession with speed in computing. "In some sense, I feel like music training led to the high-speed legacy of Google for me". In an interview Page said that "In music, you're very cognizant of time. Time is like the primary thing" and that "If you think about it from a music point of view, if you're a [[percussionist]], you hit something, it's got to happen in [[milliseconds]], fractions of a second".&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fortune.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2014/11/18/larry-page-music-education/|title=How music education influenced Google CEO Larry Page|first=Miguel|last=Helft|work=Fortune|date=Nov 18, 2014|publisher=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page was first attracted to computers when he was six years old, as he was able to "play with the stuff lying around"first-generation personal computersthat had been left by his parents.&lt;ref name="achievement.org"/&gt; He became the "first kid in his elementary school to turn in an assignment from a [[word processor]]".&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt; His older brother also taught him to take things apart and before long he was taking "everything in his house apart to see how it worked". He said that "from a very early age, I also realized I wanted to invent things. So I became really interested in technology and business. Probably from when I was 12, I knew I was going to start a company eventually."&lt;ref name= Scott&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott|first={{nobr|Virginia A.}}|date=October 30, 2008|orig-year=First published in 2008|title=Google / Virginia Scott|series=Corporations That Changed the World|location=Westport, Connecticut; London|publisher=Greenwood Press |page=2|isbn=978-0313351273 |issn=1939-2486|lccn=2008030541|oclc=234146408|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page attended the Okemos [[Montessori]] School (now called Montessori Radmoor) in [[Okemos, Michigan|Okemos]], Michigan, from 1975 to 1979, and graduated from [[East Lansing High School]] in 1991. He attended [[Interlochen Center for the Arts]] as a saxophonist for two summers while in high school.

== PhD studies and research ==
After enrolling in a [[computer science]] [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] program at [[Stanford University]], Page was in search of a [[dissertation]] theme and considered exploring the mathematical properties of the [[World Wide Web]], understanding its link structure as a huge [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]his supervisor, [[Terry Winograd]], encouraged him to pursue the idea, and Page recalled in 2008 that it was the best advice he had ever received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The best advice I ever got|url=http://archive.fortune.com/galleries/2008/fortune/0804/gallery.bestadvice.fortune/2.html|website=Fortune|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=April 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also considered doing research on [[telepresence]] and [[autonomous cars]] during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Faculty Summit 2009: Meet Google Founder Larry Page|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUNqsYUVPQY|website=GoogleTechTalks on YouTube|publisher=Google|accessdate=February 2, 2015|format=Video upload|date=October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doi10.1016/S0169-75529800110-X"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Brin | first1 = Sergey| authorlink1 = Sergey Brin| last2 = Page | first2 = Lawrence| authorlink2 = Larry Page| doi = 10.1016/S0169-7552(98)00110-X | title = The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual Web search engine | journal = Computer Networks and ISDN Systems | volume = 30 |issue=1|pages = 107117 |location=[Amsterdam]|publisher=Elsevier Science Publishers|date=April 1998|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016975529800110X/pdf?md5=55915a8a2d48367394270d7212c3d5fe&amp;pid=1-s2.0-S016975529800110X-main.pdf|format=PDF| issn = 0169-7552|lccn=86641126|oclc=884480703}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brin|first=Sergey| authorlink1 = Sergey Brin|last2=Page| authorlink2 = Larry Page|first2=Lawrence|title=Reprint of: The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual web search engine|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128612003611|format=PDF|journal=Computer Networks|location=Amsterdam, Netherlands|publisher=Elsiver|date=December 17, 2012|volume=56|issue=18|pages=38253833|issn=1389-1286|doi=10.1016/j.comnet.2012.10.007|url-access=subscription|lccn=sn99047167|oclc=610365057}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wiredbirth"/&gt;

Page focused on the problem of finding out which web pages link to a given page, considering the number and nature of such backlinks as valuable information for that pagethe role of [[citation]]s in [[academic publishing]] would also become pertinent for the research.&lt;ref name="wiredbirth"&gt;{{cite web|author1=John Battelle|title=The Birth of Google|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/battelle.html?tw=wn_tophead_4|website=Wired|publisher=Cond Nast Digital|accessdate=February 22, 2015|date=August 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sergey Brin]], a fellow Stanford PhD [[student]], would soon join Page's research project, nicknamed "[[BackRub]]."&lt;ref name="wiredbirth"/&gt; Together, the pair authored a research paper titled "The Anatomy of a Large-Scale [[Hypertext]]ual Web Search Engine", which became one of the most downloaded scientific documents in the history of the Internet at the time.&lt;ref name="achievement.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="doi10.1016/S0169-75529800110-X"/&gt;

[[John Battelle]], co-founder of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine, wrote that Page had reasoned that the:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... entire Web was loosely based on the premise of citationafter all, what is a link but a citation? If he could devise a method to count and qualify each backlink on the Web, as Page puts it "the Web would become a more valuable place."&lt;ref name="wiredbirth"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Battelle further described how Page and Brin began working together on the project:

{{quote|At the time Page conceived of BackRub, the Web comprised an estimated 10 million documents, with an untold number of links between them. The computing resources required to crawl such a beast were well beyond the usual bounds of a student project. Unaware of exactly what he was getting into, Page began building out his crawler. The idea's complexity and scale lured Brin to the job. A [[polymath]] who had jumped from project to project without settling on a thesis topic, he found the premise behind BackRub fascinating. "I talked to lots of research groups" around the school, Brin recalls, "and this was the most exciting project, both because it tackled the Web, which represents human knowledge, and because I liked Larry."&lt;ref name=wiredbirth/&gt;}}

=== Search engine development ===
To convert the backlink data gathered by BackRub's [[web crawler]] into a measure of importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm, and realized that it could be used to build a [[search engine]] far superior to existing ones.&lt;ref name="wiredbirth" /&gt; The new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the [[backlink]]s that connected one Web page to another.&lt;ref name="Moschovitis"&gt;Moschovitis Group. ''The Internet: A Historical Encyclopedia'', ABC-CLIO, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;Combining their ideas, the pair began utilizing Page's dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the not nascent search engine with Stanford's broadband campus network.&lt;ref name="wiredbirth"/&gt; After filling Page's room with equipment, they then converted Brin's dorm room into an office and programming center, where they tested their new search engine designs on the Web. The rapid growth of their project caused Stanford's computing infrastructure to experience problems.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Enlightenment man|url=http://www.economist.com/node/12673407|website=The Economist|publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited|accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=December 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page and Brin used the former's basic [[HTML]] programming skills to set up a simple search page for users, as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate. They also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users. As their search engine grew in popularity among Stanford users, it required additional [[server (computing)|server]]s to process the queries. In August 1996, the initial version of Google, still on the Stanford University website, was made available to Internet users.&lt;ref name="wiredbirth" /&gt;[[File:Page+brin by origa.jpg|thumb|177x177px|Page and [[Sergey Brin]] by [[Graziano Origa]] ]]By early 1997, the BackRub page described the state as follows:

BackRub already exhibited the rudimentary functions and characteristics of a search engine: a query input was entered and it provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance. Page recalled: "We realized that we had a querying tool. It gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of follow-up pages."&lt;ref name="archive.wired.com"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/battelle.html?pg=2&amp;topic=battelle&amp;topic_set= |title = Wired 13.08: The Birth of Google |website = wired.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Page said that in mid-1998 they finally realized the further potential of their project: "Pretty soon, we had 10,000 searches a day. And we figured, maybe this is really real."&lt;ref name="economist.com" /&gt;

Some compared Page and Brin's vision to the impact of [[Johannes Gutenberg]], the inventor of modern [[printing]]:
{{Quote|In 1440, Johannes Gutenberg introduced Europe to the mechanical printing press, printing Bibles for mass consumption. The technology allowed for books and manuscripts&amp;nbsp; originally replicated by hand&amp;nbsp; to be printed at a much faster rate, thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the European Renaissance&amp;nbsp;... Google has done a similar job.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.librarystuff.net/2009/10/01/google-the-gutenberg/ "Google the Gutenberg"]. ''Information Technology''. October 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The comparison was also noted by the authors of ''The Google Story'': "Not since Gutenberg&amp;nbsp;... has any new invention empowered individuals, and transformed access to information, as profoundly as Google."&lt;ref name=Vise&gt;[[Vise, David]], and [[Malseed, Mark]]. ''[[The Google Story]]'', Delta Publ. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, not long after the two "cooked up their new engine for web searches, they began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the web," such as digitizing books and expanding health information.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

==== Founding ====
Mark Malseed wrote in a 2003 [[feature story]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Soliciting funds from faculty members, family and friends, daniel and Page scraped together enough to buy some servers and rent that famous garage in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]]. ... [soon after], [[Sun Microsystems]] co-founder [[Andy Bechtolsheim]] wrote a $100,000 check to "Google, Inc." The only problem was, "Google, Inc." did not yet existthe company hadn't yet been incorporated. For two weeks, as they handled the paperwork, the young men had nowhere to deposit the money."&lt;ref name="Moment"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malseed|first=Mark|date=February 2007|title=The Story of Sergey Brin|journal=[[Moment Magazine]]|url=http://www.oldsite.momentmag.net/moment/issues/2007/02/200702-BrinFeature.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130121055147/http://www.oldsite.momentmag.net/moment/issues/2007/02/200702-BrinFeature.html| archivedate=January 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1998,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.ca/about/company/history/&lt;/ref&gt; Brin and Page incorporated Google, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.google.com/corporate/execs.html#larry| title = Larry Page Profile | publisher = Google }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the initial domain name of "[[Googol]]," derived from a number that consists of one followed by one hundred zerosthis represented the vast amount of data that the search engine was intended to explore. Following inception, Page appointed himself as CEO, while Brin, named Google's co-founder, served as Google's president.&lt;ref name="Car"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Nicholas Carlson|title=The Untold Story Of Larry Page's Incredible Comeback|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/larry-page-the-untold-story-2014-4?page=2|website=Business Insider|publisher=Business Insider, Inc|accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Nicholas Carlson wrote in 2014:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
While Google is often thought of as the invention of two young computer whizzesSergey and Larry, Larry and Sergeythe truth is that Google is a creation of Larry Page, helped along by Sergey Brin.&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The pair's mission was: "to organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful."&lt;ref name="Sam"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Samuel Gibbs|title=Google has 'outgrown' its 14-year old mission statement, says Larry Page|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/03/larry-page-google-dont-be-evil-sergey-brin|accessdate=February 2, 2015|work=The Guardian|date=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a [[United States dollar|US$]]1-million loan from friends and family, the inaugural team eventually moved into a Mountain View office by the start of 2000. In 1999, Page experimented with smaller sized server units so that Google could fit more into each square meter of the third-party warehouses that the company rented to store their servers, which eventually led to a search engine that ran much faster than Google's competitors at the time.&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;

By June 2000, Google had indexed one billion Internet URLs, or [[Uniform Resource Locators]], making it the most comprehensive search engine on the Web at the time. The company cited [[NEC]] Research Institute data in its June 26 press release, stating that "there are more than 1 billion web pages online today," with Google "providing access to 560 million full-text indexed web pages and 500 million partially indexed URLs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Launches Worlds Largest Search Engine|url=http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2000/06/google-launches-worlds-largest-search.html|website=News From Google|publisher=Google|accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=June 26, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Early management style ====
During his first tenure as CEO, Page embarked on a past attempt to fire all of Google's project managers in 2001. Page's plan involved all of Googles engineers reporting to a VP of engineering, who would then report directly to himPage explained that he didnt like non-engineers supervising engineers due to their limited technical knowledge.&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt; Page even documented his management tenets for his team to use as a reference:

* Don't delegate: Do everything you can yourself to make things go faster.
* Don't get in the way if you're not adding value. Let the people actually doing the work talk to each other while you go do something else.
* Don't be a [[bureaucrat]].
* Ideas are more important than age. Just because someone is junior doesn't mean they don't deserve respect and cooperation.
* The worst thing you can do is stop someone from doing something by saying, "No. Period." If you say no, you have to help them find a better way to get it done.&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;

Even though Page's new model was unsustainable and led to disgruntlement among the affected employees, his issue with engineers being managed by non-engineering staff gained traction more broadly. Eventually, the practice of only instating engineers into the management roles of engineering teams was established as a standard across [[Silicon Valley]].&lt;ref name="Max" /&gt;

Page also believed that the faster Googles search engine returned answers, the more it would be used. He fretted over [[milliseconds]] and pushed his engineersfrom those who developed [[algorithm]]s to those who built [[data center]]sto think about [[lag|lag times]]. He also pushed for keeping Googles home page famously sparse in its design because it would help the search results load faster.&lt;ref name="fortune.com"/&gt;

=== 20012011 ===

==== Changes in management and expansion ====
Before Silicon Valley's two most prominent investors, [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]] and [[Sequoia Capital]], agreed to invest a combined total of $50 million into Google, they applied pressure on Page to step down as CEO so that a more experienced leader could build a "world-class management team." Page eventually became amenable to the idea after meeting with other technology CEOs, including [[Steve Jobs]] and Intels [[Andrew Grove]]. [[Eric Schmidt]], who had been hired as Chairman of Google in March 2001, left his full-time position as the CEO of [[Novell]] to take on the same role at Google in August of the same year, and Page moved aside to assume the President of Products role.&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;

Under Schmidt's leadership, Google underwent a period of major growth and expansion, which included its [[initial public offering]] (IPO) on August 20, 2004. However, he always acted in consultation with Page and Brin when he embarked on initiatives such as the hiring of an executive team and the creation of a [[sales force management system]]. Furthermore, Page remained the boss at Google in the eyes of the employees, as he gave final approval on all new hires and it was Page who provided the signature for the IPO, the latter making him a billionaire at the age of thirty.&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;

Page led the acquisition of [[Android (operating system)|Android]] for $50 million in 2005 to fulfill his ambition to place handheld computers in the possession of consumers so that they could access Google from anywhere. The purchase was made without Schmidt's knowledge, but the CEO was not perturbed by the relatively small acquisition. Page became passionate about Android, and spent large amounts of time with Android CEO and cofounder [[Andy Rubin]]. By September 2008, [[T-Mobile]] launched the G1, the first phone using Android software and, by 2010, 17.2 percent of the handset market consisted of Android sales, overtaking Apple for the first time. Android became the worlds most popular mobile operating system shortly afterward.&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;

==== Assumption of CEO position at Google ====
Following a January 2011 announcement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704881304576094340081291776?mod=googlenews_wsj | title = Google's Page to Replace Schmidt as CEO | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Amir | last=Efrati | date=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Page officially became the chief executive of Google on April 4, 2011, while Schmidt stepped down to become executive chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/about/company/facts/management/#section-board |title=Management team  Company  Google |publisher=Google.com |accessdate=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Google had over $180 billion market capitalization and more than 24,000 employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maintour.com/meritbadge/american_business.htm American Business BSA Merit Badge Guide], June 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Schmidt announced the end of his tenure as CEO on January 20, 2011, he jokingly tweeted on [[Twitter]]: "Adult-supervision no longer needed." [[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] organizational management reporter, Max Nisen, described the decade prior to Page's second appointment as Google's CEO as his "lost decade." While Page continued to exert a significant influence at Google during this time, overseeing product development and other operations, he became increasingly disconnected and less responsive over time.&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Max"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Max Nisen|title=Larry Pages lost decade was the best thing to ever happen to Google|url=http://qz.com/202710/larry-pages-lost-decade-was-the-best-thing-to-ever-happen-to-google/|accessdate=February 6, 2015|work=Quartz|date=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20112013 ===
As Google's new CEO, Page's two key goals were the development of greater autonomy for the executives overseeing the most important divisions, and higher levels of collaboration, communication and unity among the teams. Page also formed what the media called the "L-Team," a group of senior vice-presidents who reported directly to him and worked in close proximity to his office for a portion of the working week.&lt;ref name="Owe"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Owen Thomas|title=There's A Pretty Big Tension In How Larry Page Is Running Google|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-larry-page-is-running-google-2013-3?IR=T|website=Business Insider|publisher=Business Insider Inc|accessdate=February 1, 2015|date=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he reorganized the companys senior management, placing a CEO-like manager at the top of Google's most important product divisions, including [[YouTube]], [[AdWords]], and [[Google Search]].&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;

In accordance with a more cohesive team environment, Page declared a new "zero tolerance for fighting" policy that contrasted with his approach during the early days of Google, when he would use his harsh and intense arguments with Brin as an exemplar for senior management. Page had changed his thinking during his time away from the CEO role, as he eventually arrived at the conclusion that his greatly ambitious goals required a harmonious team dynamic. As part of Page's collaborative rejuvenation process, Google's products and applications were consolidated and underwent an [[aesthetic]] overhaul.&lt;ref name="Max" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Die" /&gt;

==== Changes and consolidation process ====
At least 70 of Google's products, features and services were eventually shut down by March 2013, while the appearance and nature of the remaining ones were unified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Urs Hlzle|title=A second spring of cleaning|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.se/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html|website=Official Google Blog|publisher=Google|accessdate=February 3, 2015|date=March 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hel" /&gt; Jon Wiley, lead designer of Google Search at the time, codenamed Page's redesign overhaul, which officially commenced on April 4, 2011, "Project Kennedy," based on Page's use of the term "moonshots" to describe ambitious projects in a January 2013 ''[[Wired magazine|Wired]]'' interview.&lt;ref name="Die"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Dieter Bohn, Ellis Hamburger|title=Redesigning Google: how Larry Page engineered a beautiful revolution|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/24/3904134/google-redesign-how-larry-page-engineered-beautiful-revolution|website=The Verge|publisher=[[Vox Media, Inc]]|accessdate=February 1, 2015|date=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lev"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Steven Levy|title=Googles Larry Page on Why Moon Shots Matter|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/01/ff-qa-larry-page/all/|website=Wired|publisher=Cond Nast|accessdate=February 1, 2015|date=January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An initiative named "Kanna" previously attempted to create a uniform design aesthetic for Google's range of products, but it was too difficult at that point in the company's history for one team to drive such change. Matias Duarte, senior director of the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] user experience at the time that "Kennedy" started, explained in 2013 that "Google passionately cares about design." Page proceeded to consult with the Google Creative Lab design team, based in New York City, to find an answer to his question of what a "cohesive vision" of Google might look like.&lt;ref name="Die" /&gt;

The eventual results of "Kennedy," which were progressively rolled out from June 2011 until January 2013, were described by [[The Verge]] technology publication as focused upon "refinement, white space, cleanliness, elasticity, usefulness, and most of all simplicity." The final products were aligned with Page's aim for a consistent suite of products that can "move fast," and "Kennedy" was called a "design revolution" by Duarte. Page's "UXA" (user/graphics interface) design team then emerged from the "Kennedy" project, tasked with "designing and developing a true [[User interface|UI]] framework that transforms Google's [[application software]] into a beautiful, mature, accessible and consistent platform for its users." Unspoken of in public, the small UXA unit was designed to ensure that "Kennedy" became an "institution."&lt;ref name="Die" /&gt;

==== Acquisition strategy and new products ====
When acquiring products and companies for Google, Page asked whether the [[business acquisition]] passed the toothbrush test as an initial qualifier, asking the question "Is it something you will use once or twice a day, and does it make your life better?". This approach looked for usefulness above profitability, and long-term potential over near-term financial gain, which has been noted as rare in business acquiring processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.inc.com/larry-kim/how-google-s-ceo-only-buys-companies-that-pass-his-crazy-toothbrush-test.html |title=Why Google's Larry Page Only Buys Companies That Pass His Crazy Toothbrush Test - Inc.com |website = Inc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/in-silicon-valley-mergers-must-meet-the-toothbrush-test/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1 |title =

With [[Facebook]]'s influence rapidly expanding during the start of Page's second tenure, he finally responded to the intensive competition with Google's own social network, [[Google+]], in mid-2011. After several delays, the social network was released through a very limited field test and was led by [[Vic Gundotra]], Google's then senior vice president of social.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Ben Parr |title=Google Launches Google+ To Battle Facebook [PICS] |url = http://mashable.com/2011/06/28/google-plus/ |website=Mashable |publisher=Mashable |accessdate=February 2, 2015 |date=June 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, Page announced that Google would spend $12.5 billion to acquire [[Motorola Mobility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Robin Wauters |title=Google Buys Motorola Mobility For $12.5B, Says "Android Will Stay Open" |url = https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/15/breaking-google-buys-motorola-for-12-5-billion/ |website=TechCrunch |publisher=AOL Inc |accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=August 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purchase was primarily motivated by Google's need to secure [[patents]] to protect Android from lawsuits by companies including [[Apple Inc]].&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt; Page wrote on Google's official blog on August 15, 2011 that "companies including Microsoft and Apple are banding together in anti-competitive patent attacks on Android. The [[United States Department of Justice]] had to intervene in the results of one recent patent auction to "protect competition and innovation in the [[open source software]] community"... Our acquisition of Motorola will increase competition by strengthening Googles patent portfolio, which will enable us to better protect Android from anti-competitive threats from Microsoft, Apple and other companies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://googleblog.blogspot.se/2011/08/supercharging-android-google-to-acquire.html |title=Official Google Blog: Supercharging Android: Google to Acquire Motorola Mobility |work=Official Google Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://bgr.com/2011/08/15/google-ceo-larry-page-explains-reasoning-behind-motorola-acquisition-spoiler-patents/|title=Google CEO Larry Page explains reasoning behind Motorola acquisition (spoiler: patents)|work=BGR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page also ventured into hardware and Google unveiled the [[Chromebook]] in May 2012. The hardware product was a laptop that ran on a Google operating system, [[Chrome OS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Om Malik |title=Google launches Chromebook, Chromebox &amp; gets it right |url = https://gigaom.com/2012/05/29/google-newchromebook-chromebox/ |website=Gigaom |publisher=Gigaom, Inc. |accessdate=February 2, 2015 |date=May 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20132015 ===
In January 2013, Page participated in a rare interview with ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', in which writer Steven Levy discussed Page's "10X" mentalityGoogle employees are expected to create products and services that are at least 10 times better than those of its competitorsin the introductory [[blurb]]. [[Astro Teller]], the head of [[Google X]], explained to Levy that 10X is "just core to who he [Page] is," while Page's "focus is on where the next 10X will come from."&lt;ref name="Lev" /&gt; In his interview with Levy, Page referred to the success of YouTube and Android as examples of "crazy" ideas that investors were not initially interested in, saying: "If youre not doing some things that are crazy, then youre doing the wrong things."&lt;ref name="Lev" /&gt; Page also stated that he was "very happy" with the status of Google+, and discussed concerns over the Internet in relation to the [[SOPA]] bill and an [[International Telecommunication Union]] proposal that had been recently introduced:&lt;blockquote&gt;
... I do think the Internets under much greater attack than it has been in the past. Governments are now afraid of the Internet because of the Middle East stuff, and so theyre a little more willing to listen to what I see as a lot of commercial interests that just want to make money by restricting peoples freedoms. But theyve also seen a tremendous user reaction, like the backlash against SOPA. I think that governments fight users freedoms at their own peril.&lt;ref name="Lev" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the May 2013 I/O developers conference in [[San Francisco]], Page delivered a keynote address and said that "We're at maybe 1% of what is possible. Despite the faster change, we're still moving slow relative to the opportunities we have. I think a lot of that is because of the negativity... Every story I read is Google vs someone else. That's boring. We should be focusing on building the things that don't exist" and that he was "sad the Web isn't advancing as fast as it should be" citing a perceived focus on negativity and zero sum games among some in the technology sector as a cause for that.&lt;ref name="brainyquote.com"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/l/larry_page.html |title=Larry Page Quotes |author=|date=|work=BrainyQuote}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to an audience question, Page noted an issue that Google had been experiencing with [[Microsoft]], whereby the latter made its Outlook program interoperable with Google, but did not allow for [[backward compatibility]]he referred to Microsoft's practice as "milking off." During the question-and-answer section of his keynote, Page expressed interest in [[Burning Man]], which Brin had previously praisedit was a motivating factor for the latter during Schmidt's hiring process, as Brin liked that Schmidt had attended the week-long annual event.&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/05/google-io-2013-liveblog/#50512764920 |title=Liveblog: Get the Latest Updates From Google I/O 2013 |work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Shara Tibken |title=Google's Page: We should be building great things that don't exist |url = http://www.cnet.com/news/googles-page-we-should-be-building-great-things-that-dont-exist/ |website=CNet |publisher=CNet |accessdate=February 1, 2015 |date=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, Page launched the independent [[Calico (company)|Calico]] initiative, a [[R&amp;D]] project in the field of [[biotechnology]]. Google announced that Calico seeks to innovate and make improvements in the field of human health, and appointed Art Levinson, chairman of Apple's board and former CEO of [[Genentech]], to be the new division's CEO. Page's official statement read: "Illness and aging affect all our families. With some longer term, moonshot thinking around healthcare and [[biotechnology]], I believe we can improve millions of lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Casey Newton |title=Google launches Calico, a new company tasked with extending human life |url = https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/18/4744650/google-launches-calico-as-separate-company-to-improve-human-health |website=The Verge |publisher=[[Vox Media, Inc.]] |accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=September 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page participated in a March 2014 TedX conference that was held in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada. The presentation was scripted by Page's chief [[Public relations|PR]] executive Rachel Whetstone, and Googles [[Chief marketing officer|CMO]] Lorraine Twohill, and a demonstration of an artificially intelligent computer program was displayed on a large screen.&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;
Page responded to a question about corporations, noting that corporations largely get a "bad rap", which he stated was because they were probably doing the same incremental things they were doing "50 or 20 years ago". He went on to juxtapose that kind of incremental approach to his vision of Google counteracting calcification through driving technology innovation at a high rate. Page mentioned [[Elon Musk]] and [[SpaceX]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He [Musk] wants to go to Mars to back up humanity. Thats a worthy goal. We have a lot of employees at Google whove become pretty wealthy. Youre working because you want to change [[Earth|the world]] and make it better ... Id like for us to help out more than we are.&lt;ref name=bi20140320&gt;{{cite news |last1=Yarow |first1=Jay |title=LARRY PAGE: I Would Rather Give My Billions To Elon Musk Than Charity |url = http://www.businessinsider.com/larry-page-elon-musk-2014-3 |accessdate=28 December 2014 |work=Business Insider |date=20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Page also mentioned [[Nikola Tesla]] with regard to invention and commercialization:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Invention is not enough. Tesla invented the electric power we use, but he struggled to get it out to people...

== Alphabet ==
On August 10, 2015, Page announced on Google's official blog that Google had restructured into a number of subsidiaries of a new [[holding company]] known as [[Alphabet Inc.|Alphabet Inc]] with Page becoming CEO of [[Alphabet Inc.|Alphabet Inc]] and [[Sundar Pichai]] assuming the position of CEO of [[Google Inc.]] In his announcement, Page described the planned holding company as follows:&lt;ref name="gIsForGoogle"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/google-alphabet.html|title=G is for Google|publisher=Google Official Blog|last1=Page|first1=Larry|accessdate= August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{pullquote|Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main Internet products contained in Alphabet instead.

As well as explaining the origin of the company's name:
{{pullquote|We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search!

He also wrote that there was a desire to improve "the transparency and oversight of what were doing," and to allow greater control of unrelated companies previously within the Google ecosystem.&lt;ref name="gIsForGoogle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wire-2015-new-company"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Metz|first1=Cade|title=A New Company Called Alphabet Now Owns Google |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/08/new-company-called-alphabet-owns-google/ |website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|publisher=[[Cond Nast]]|accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Page|first1=Larry|authorlink1=Larry Page|title=G is for Google |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/google-alphabet.html |website=Official Google Blog |accessdate=August 10, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810210148/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/google-alphabet.html |archivedate=August 10, 2015|deadurl=no|date=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existing buildings were "deconstructed" and the materials donated for reuse. The ecohouse was designed to "minimize the impact on the environment." Page worked with an [[arborist]] to replace some trees that were in poor health with others that used less water to maintain.
