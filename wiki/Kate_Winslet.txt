'''Kate Elizabeth Winslet''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} (born 5 October 1975) is an English actress. She has appeared in numerous period dramas and tragedies, and is often drawn to portraying "angst-ridden" women. Winslet is the recipient of [[List of awards and nominations received by Kate Winslet|several accolades]], including three [[British Academy Film Awards]], and is among the few performers to have won [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards#Three competitive awards|Academy, Emmy, and Grammy Awards]].

Born in [[Reading, Berkshire]], Winslet studied drama at the [[Redroofs Theatre School]]. Her first screen appearance, at the age of 15, was in the British television series ''[[Dark Season]]'' (1991). She made her film debut playing a teenage murderess in ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'' (1994), and received her first [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|BAFTA Award]] for playing [[Marianne Dashwood]] in ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1995). Global stardom followed soon after with her leading role in the epic romance ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997). It was the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film]] of all time to that point, after which she eschewed parts in blockbusters in favour of critically acclaimed but little-seen period pieces, including ''[[Quills]]'' (2000) and ''[[Iris (2001 film)|Iris]]'' (2001).

The science fiction romance ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'' (2004), in which Winslet was cast against [[typecasting (acting)|type]] in a contemporary setting, proved to be a turning point in her career, and she gained further recognition for her performances in ''[[Finding Neverland (film)|Finding Neverland]]'' (2004), ''[[Little Children (film)|Little Children]]'' (2006), ''[[Revolutionary Road (film)|Revolutionary Road]]'' (2008), and ''[[The Reader (2008 film)|The Reader]]'' (2008). For playing a Nazi camp guard in the last of these, she won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Academy Award]] for Best Actress. In the 2010s, Winslet played a single mother in 1930s America in the miniseries ''[[Mildred Pierce (miniseries)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (2011), joined the [[The Divergent Series|''Divergent'' film series]], and portrayed [[Joanna Hoffman]] in ''[[Steve Jobs (film)|Steve Jobs]]'' (2015). She won a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie|Primetime Emmy Award]] for the former and a third BAFTA Award for the latter.

For her narration of a short story in the audiobook ''Listen to the Storyteller'' (1999), Winslet won a [[Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children|Grammy Award]]. She performed the song "[[What If (Kate Winslet song)|What If]]" for the soundtrack of her film ''[[Christmas Carol: The Movie]]'' (2001). A co-founder of the charity [[Golden Hat Foundation]], which aims to create [[autism awareness]], she has written a book on the topic, ''The Golden Hat: Talking Back to Autism'' (2010). ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named her one of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] in 2009, and in 2012, she was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE). Divorced from the film directors [[Jim Threapleton]] and [[Sam Mendes]], Winslet has been married to the businessman Ned Rocknroll since 2012. She has a child from each marriage.

To avoid a scheduling conflict with ''Revolutionary Road'', Winslet turned down an offer to star in ''[[The Reader (2008 film)|The Reader]]''.

Winslet returned to acting with the five-part [[HBO]] miniseries ''[[Mildred Pierce (miniseries)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (2011), an adaptation of [[Mildred Pierce|James M.

It is about the titular heroine (Winslet), a divorce during the [[Great Depression]] struggling to establish a restaurant business while yearning for the respect of her narcissistic daughter (played by [[Evan Rachel Wood]]). Winslet, who had recently divorced Mendes, believed that certain aspects of her character's life mirrored her own.&lt;ref name="vogue11" /&gt; She was intimidated by the scope of the production, as she featured in every scene of the 280-page script.&lt;ref name="mildred1"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2011-06-24/interview-kate-winslet-on-mildred-pierce/ |title = Interview: Kate Winslet on Mildred Pierce |work = Radio Times |date = 24 June 2011 |accessdate = 28 October 2017 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171029012947/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2011-06-24/interview-kate-winslet-on-mildred-pierce/ |archivedate = 29 October 2017 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
