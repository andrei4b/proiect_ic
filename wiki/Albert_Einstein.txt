Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that [[Newtonian mechanics]] was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the [[electromagnetic field]]. This led him to develop his [[special theory of relativity]] during his time at the [[Swiss Patent Office]] in [[Bern]] (19021909), Switzerland. However, he realized that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields, and he published a paper on [[general relativity]] in 1916 with his theory of gravitation. He continued to deal with problems of [[statistical mechanics]] and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the [[Brownian motion|motion of molecules]]. He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the [[photon]] theory of light. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.&lt;ref name=Nobel&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/advanced-physicsprize2011.pdf |title=Scientific Background on the Nobel Prize in Physics 2011.

He lived in Switzerland between 1895 and 1914, except for one year in Prague, and he received his academic diploma from the Swiss [[ETH Zurich|federal polytechnic school]] (later the Eidgenssische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in Zrich in 1900. He taught theoretical physics there between 1912 and 1914 before he left for Berlin. He acquired Swiss citizenship in 1901, which he kept for the rest of his life after being stateless for more than five years. In 1905, he was awarded a PhD by the [[University of Zurich]]. The same year, he published [[Annus Mirabilis papers|four groundbreaking papers]] during his renowned ''[[annus mirabilis]]'' (miracle year) which brought him to the notice of the academic world at the age of 26.

He was visiting the United States when [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933 and he did not go back to Germany, where he had been a professor at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]]. He settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940.&lt;ref name="BoyerDubofsky2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul S. Boyer|author2=Melvyn Dubofsky|title=The Oxford Companion to United States History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgtyKzBes6QC&amp;pg=PA218|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-508209-8|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the eve of [[World War II]], he endorsed a [[EinsteinSzilrd letter|letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] alerting him to the potential development of "extremely powerful bombs of a new type" and recommending that the US begin similar research. This eventually led to the [[Manhattan Project]]. Einstein supported the Allied forces, but he generally denounced the idea of using [[nuclear fission]] as a weapon. He signed the [[RussellEinstein Manifesto]] with British philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons. He was affiliated with the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton, New Jersey, until his death in 1955.

Einstein published [[List of scientific publications by Albert Einstein|more than 300 scientific papers]] and more than 150 non-scientific works.&lt;ref name=Nobel /&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul Arthur Schilpp, editor 1951 730746"&gt;{{Citation |editor=Paul Arthur Schilpp |date=1951 |title=Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist |volume=II |publisher=Harper and Brothers Publishers (Harper Torchbook edition) |location=New York |pages=730746}}. His non-scientific works include: ''About Zionism: Speeches and Lectures by Professor Albert Einstein'' (1930), "Why War?" (1933, co-authored by [[Sigmund Freud]]), ''The World As I See It'' (1934), ''Out of My Later Years'' (1950), and a book on science for the general reader, ''[[The Evolution of Physics]]'' (1938, co-authored by [[Leopold Infeld]]).&lt;/ref&gt; His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word "Einstein" synonymous with "genius".&lt;ref name="wordnetweb.princeton.edu"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=Einstein |title=Result of WordNet Search for Einstein |version=3.1 |publisher=The Trustees of Princeton University |accessdate=2015-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugene Wigner]] wrote of Einstein in comparison to his contemporaries that "Einstein's understanding was deeper even than [[John von Neumann|Jancsi von Neumann's]]. His mind was both more penetrating and more original than von Neumann's. And that is a very remarkable statement."&lt;ref&gt;''The Recollections of Eugene P. Wigner'', By Eugene Paul Wigner, Andrew Szanton, (Springer, 11 Nov 2013), page 170&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert Einstein was born in [[Ulm]], in the [[Kingdom of Wrttemberg]] in the [[German Empire]], on 14&amp;nbsp;March 1879.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; His parents were [[Hermann Einstein]], a salesman and engineer, and [[Pauline Koch]]. In 1880, the family moved to [[Munich]], where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded ''Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein &amp; Cie'', a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on [[direct current]].&lt;ref name=Bio /&gt;

The Einsteins were non-observant [[Ashkenazi Jews]], and Albert attended a [[Catholic school|Catholic elementary school]] in Munich, from the age of 5, for three years. At the age of 8, he was transferred to the [[Luitpold Gymnasium]] (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the [[German Empire]] seven years later.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&amp;pg=PA59 5961]}}

In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard to the more efficient [[alternating current]] (AC) standard.&lt;ref&gt;Barry R. Parker, Einstein: The Passions of a Scientist, Prometheus Books  2003, page 31&lt;/ref&gt; The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory. In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to [[Milan]] and a few months later to [[Pavia]]. When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein, then 15, stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue [[electrical engineering]], but Einstein clashed with authorities and resented the school's regimen and teaching method. He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict [[rote learning]]. At the end of December 1894, he travelled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor's note.{{Sfnp|Flsing|1997|pp=3031}} During his time in Italy he wrote a short essay with the title "On the Investigation of the State of the [[Aether theories|Ether]] in a Magnetic Field".{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), doc. 5}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Mehra |first=Jagdish |contribution=Albert Einstein's first paper |title=The Golden Age of Physics |publisher=World Scientific |date=2001 |isbn=981-02-4985-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein always excelled at maths and physics from a young age, reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers. The twelve year old Einstein taught himself algebra and Euclidean geometry over a single summer. Einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] at age 12.&lt;ref&gt;''The Three-body Problem from Pythagoras to Hawking'', Mauri Valtonen, Joanna Anosova, Konstantin Kholshevnikov, Aleksandr Myllri, Victor Orlov, Kiyotaka Tanikawa, (Springer 2016), page 43, Simon and Schuster, 4 Sep 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A family tutor Max Talmud says that after he had given the 12 year old Einstein a geometry textbook, after a short time "[Einstein] had worked through the whole book. He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics... Soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not follow."&lt;ref name="Einstein page 17"&gt;Einstein: His Life and Universe, By Walter Isaacson, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; His passion for geometry and algebra led the twelve year old to become convinced that nature could be understood as a "mathematical structure".&lt;ref name="Einstein page 17"/&gt; Einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12, and as a 14 year old he says he had "mastered [[integral calculus|integral]] and [[differential calculus|differential]] [[calculus]]".&lt;ref&gt;Einstein: His Life and Universe, By Walter Isaacson, page 16&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 13, Einstein was introduced to [[Kant]]'s [[Critique of Pure Reason]], and Kant became his favourite philosopher, his tutor stating: "At the time he was still a child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant's works, incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him."&lt;ref name="Einstein page 17"/&gt;

In 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Polytechnic]] in [[Zrich]] (later the Eidgenssische Technische Hochschule, ETH). He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination,{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), p. 11}} but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics.{{Sfnp|Flsing|1997|pp=3637}} On the advice of the principal of the Polytechnic, he attended the [[Aargau|Argovian]] [[Mittelschule|cantonal school]] ([[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]) in [[Aarau]], Switzerland, in 1895 and 1896 to complete his secondary schooling. While lodging with the family of professor Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie. Albert's sister [[Maja Einstein|Maja]] later married Winteler's son Paul.{{Sfnp|Highfield|Carter|1993|pp=21, 31, 5657}} In January 1896, with his father's approval, Einstein renounced his [[German citizenship|citizenship in the German Kingdom of Wrttemberg]] to avoid [[Conscription in Germany|military service]].{{Sfnp|Flsing|1997|p=40}} In September 1896, he passed the Swiss [[Matura]] with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on a scale of 16.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), docs. 2127}} At 17, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Zrich Polytechnic. Marie Winteler, who was a year older, moved to [[Olsberg, Aargau|Olsberg]], Switzerland, for a teaching post.

Einstein's future wife, a 20-year old [[Serbs|Serbian]] woman [[Mileva Mari]], also enrolled at the Polytechnic that year. She was the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the next few years, Einstein and Mari's friendship developed into romance, and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein was taking an increasing interest. In 1900, Einstein passed the exams in Maths and Physics and was awarded the Federal Polytechnic teaching diploma.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), doc. 67}} There have been claims that Mari collaborated with Einstein on his 1905 papers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Troemel-Ploetz, D. |title=Mileva Einstein-Mari: The Woman Who Did Einstein's Mathematics |work=Women's Studies Int.

An early correspondence between Einstein and Mari was discovered and published in 1987 which revealed that the couple had a daughter named [[Lieserl Einstein|"Lieserl"]], born in early 1902 in [[Novi Sad]] where Mari was staying with her parents. Mari returned to Switzerland without the child, whose real name and fate are unknown. The contents of Einstein's letter in September 1903 suggest that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of [[scarlet fever]] in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;J. Renn &amp; R.

Einstein and Mari married in January 1903. In May 1904, their son [[Hans Albert Einstein]] was born in [[Bern]], Switzerland. Their son [[Einstein family#Eduard "Tete" Einstein (Albert's son)|Eduard]] was born in Zrich in July 1910. The couple moved to Berlin in April 1914, but Mari returned to Zrich with their sons after learning that Einstein's chief romantic attraction was his first and second cousin Elsa.{{Sfnp|Stachel|1966}} They divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years.{{sfnp|Stachel|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&amp;pg=PA50 50]}} Eduard had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name="Robinson2015a"&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Andrew|authorlink=Walter Isaacson|title=Einstein: A Hundred Years of Relativity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Px4_CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA144|year=2015|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-16989-7|pages=143145}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, finally being committed permanently after her death.{{sfnp|Neffe|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=B8K6n177ZwcC&amp;pg=PA203 203]}}

In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love Marie Winteler about his marriage and his strong feelings for her. He wrote in 1910, while his wife was pregnant with their second child: "I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be". He spoke about a "misguided love" and a "missed life" regarding his love for Marie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bernerzeitung.ch/region/bern/Die-Liebesbriefe-des-untreuen-Einstein/story/11875058 |first=Urs | last=Wthrich |title=Die Liebesbriefe des untreuen Einstein |trans-title=The love letters of the unfaithful Einstein |newspaper=BZ Berner Zeitung |location=Bern, Switzerland |date=11 April 2015 |language=German |quote=Ich denke in innigster Liebe an Dich in jeder freien Minute und bin so unglcklich, wie nur ein Mensch es sein kann. |accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friends===
Among Einstein's well-known friends were [[Michele Besso]], [[Paul Ehrenfest]], [[Marcel Grossmann]], [[Jnos Plesch]], [[Daniel Q. Posin]], [[Maurice Solovine]], and [[Stephen Wise]].&lt;ref&gt;''An Einstein Encyclopedia'', Alice Calaprice, Daniel Kennefick, Robert Schulmann, p. 65 et seq, Princeton University Press, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating in 1900, Einstein spent almost two frustrating years searching for a teaching post. He acquired [[Switzerland|Swiss]] citizenship in February 1901,{{Sfnp|Flsing|1997|p=82}} but was not [[conscription in Switzerland|conscripted]] for medical reasons. With the help of [[Marcel Grossmann]]'s father, he secured a job in [[Bern]] at the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property|Federal Office for Intellectual Property]], the patent office,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Grossmann.html |title=Grossmann biography |publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland |editor=J J O'Connor |editor2=E F Robertson |date=May 2010 |type=scientific website? |accessdate=2015-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=63}} as an [[Patent examiner|assistant examiner  level III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Einstein at the patent office|url=https://www.ipi.ch/en/about-us/einstein/einstein-at-the-patent-office.html |publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property, IGE/IPI |location=Berne, Switzerland |date=6 February 2014 |type=official website |accessdate=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IGEFAQ&gt;{{cite web |title=FAQ about Einstein and the Institute |url=https://www.ipi.ch/en/about-us/einstein/frequently-asked-questions.html |publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property, IGE/IPI |location=Berne, Switzerland |date=27 May 2014 |type=official website |accessdate=2015-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein evaluated [[patent application]]s for a variety of devices including a gravel sorter and an electromechanical typewriter.&lt;ref name=IGEFAQ /&gt; In 1903, his position at the Swiss Patent Office became permanent, although he was passed over for promotion until he "fully mastered machine technology".&lt;ref name=GalisonClock&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=1344127 |first=Peter | last=Galison |title=Einstein's Clocks: The Question of Time |work=Critical Inquiry |volume=26 |issue=2 Winter |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |date=2000 |pp=355389 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|370}}

Much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical-mechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the [[thought experiment]]s that eventually led Einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time.&lt;ref name=GalisonClock /&gt;{{rp|377}}

With a few friends he had met in Bern, Einstein started a small discussion group in 1902, self-mockingly named "[[Olympia Academy|The Olympia Academy]]", which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy. Their readings included the works of [[Henri Poincar]], [[Ernst Mach]], and [[David Hume]], which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=79-84}}

==== First scientific papers ====
[[File:Albert Einstein (Nobel).png|thumb|upright|Einstein's official 1921 portrait after receiving the Nobel Prize in Physics]]
In 1900, Einstein's paper [[List of scientific publications by Albert Einstein#Journal articles|"Folgerungen aus den Capillarittserscheinungen"]] ("Conclusions from the Capillarity Phenomena") was published in the journal ''[[Annalen der Physik]]''.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1901}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Galison |first=Peter | authorlink=Peter Galison |title=Einstein's Clocks, Poincar's Maps: Empires of Time |publisher=W.W.

As a result, Einstein was awarded a PhD by the [[University of Zrich]], with his dissertation "''A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions''".{{Sfnp|Einstein|1905b|loc="Meinem Freunde Herr Dr. Marcel Grossmann gewidmet (Dedicated to my friend, Dr. Marcel Grossmann)"}}{{Sfnp|Einstein|1926b|loc=chap. "A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions"}}

In that same year, which has been called Einstein's ''[[annus mirabilis]]'' (miracle year), he published [[Annus Mirabilis papers|four groundbreaking papers]], on the photoelectric effect, [[Brownian motion]], [[special relativity]], and the equivalence of mass and energy, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26.

=== Academic career ===
By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the [[University of Bern]]. The following year, after giving a lecture on [[electrodynamics]] and the relativity principle at the University of Zrich, [[Alfred Kleiner]] recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics. Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.ethz.ch/en/Resources/Digital-library/Einstein-Online/Associate-Professor-at-the-Universiy-of-Zurich-und-professor-in-Prague-1909-1912 |title=Associate Professor at the University of Zurich und professor in Prague (19091912) |publisher=ETH-Bibliothek Zurich, ETH Zrich, www.ethz.ch |location=Bern, Switzerland |series=Einstein Online |website=www.library.ethz.ch/en/ |date=2014 |type=digital library |language=German, English |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein became a full professor at the German [[Charles-Ferdinand University]] in [[Prague]] in April 1911, accepting [[Austria]]n citizenship in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] to do so.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=164}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/49610/1/569197996.pdf |author=von Hirschhausen, Ulrike |title=Von imperialer Inklusion zur nationalen Exklusion:Staatsbrgerschaft in sterreich- Ungarn 18671923 |publisher=WZB Social Science Research Center Berlin |date=2007 |location=Berlin, Germany |series=ZKD  Verffentlichungsreihe der Forschungsgruppe, Zivilgesellschaft, Citizenship und politische Mobilisierung in Europa" Schwerpunkt Zivilgesellschaft, Konflikte und Demokratie, Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin fr Sozialforschung |type=WZB Discussion Paper |issue=No. SP IV 2007403 |issn=1860-4315 |page=8 |quote= Eine weitere Diskontinuitt bestand viertens darin, dass die Bestimmungen der sterreichischen Staatsbrgerschaft, die in den ersten Dritteln des Jahrhunderts auch auf Ungarn angewandt worden waren, seit 1867 nur noch fr die cisleithanische Reichshlfte galten.

In July 1912, he returned to his alma mater in Zrich. From 1912 until 1914, he was professor of theoretical physics at the [[ETH Zurich]], where he taught analytical mechanics and [[thermodynamics]]. He also studied [[continuum mechanics]], the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of gravitation, on which he worked with mathematician and friend [[Marcel Grossmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.ethz.ch/en/Resources/Digital-library/Einstein-Online/Professor-at-the-ETH-Zurich-1912-1914 |title=Professor at the ETH Zurich (19121914) |publisher=ETH-Bibliothek Zurich, ETH Zrich, www.ethz.ch |location=Zurich, Switzerland |series=Einstein Online |website=www.library.ethz.ch/en/ |date=2014 |type=digital library |language=German, English |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 July 1913, he was voted for membership in the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in Berlin. [[Max Planck]] and [[Walther Nernst]] visited him the next week in Zurich to persuade him to join the academy, additionally offering him the post of director at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics]], which was soon to be established.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|p=534}} (Membership in the academy included paid salary and professorship without teaching duties at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]].) He was officially elected to the academy on 24 July, and he accepted to move to the German Empire the next year. His decision to move to Berlin was also influenced by the prospect of living near his cousin Elsa, with whom he had developed a romantic affair. He joined the academy and thus the Berlin University on 1 April 1914.{{Sfnp|Weinstein|2015|pp=1819}} As World War I broke out that year, the plan for Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics was aborted. The institute was established on 1 October 1917, with Einstein as its director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Director in the attic|url=https://www.mpg.de/dossier/einstein/in-berlin|website=www.mpg.de|publisher=Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, Mnchen|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, Einstein was elected president of the [[German Physical Society]] (19161918).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Albert Einstein: a biography| first1=Alice |last1=Calaprice |first2=Trevor |last2=Lipscombe |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |date=2005 |isbn=0-313-33080-8 |page=xix |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5eWh2O_3OAQC}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5eWh2O_3OAQC&amp;pg=PR19 Timeline, p. xix]&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on calculations Einstein made in 1911, about his new theory of general relativity, [[Gravitational lens|light from another star should be bent]] by the Sun's gravity. In 1919, that prediction was confirmed by Sir [[Arthur Eddington]] during the [[solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]]. Those observations were published in the international media, making Einstein world famous. On 7 November 1919, the leading British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' printed a banner headline that read: "Revolution in Science&amp;nbsp; New Theory of the Universe&amp;nbsp; Newtonian Ideas Overthrown".&lt;ref name="Eddington"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Andrzej |first=Stasiak |date=2003 |title=Myths in science |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=4 |issue=3 |page=236 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.embor779  |accessdate =|doi-access=free |pmc=1315907 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, he became a Foreign Member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00000116 |title=Albert Einstein (18791955) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, he was awarded the 1921 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".&lt;ref name="Nobel Prize"/&gt; While the [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]] was still considered somewhat controversial, the citation also does not treat the cited work as an ''explanation'' but merely as a ''discovery of the law'', as the idea of photons was considered outlandish and did not receive universal acceptance until the 1924 derivation of the [[Planck spectrum]] by [[S. N. Bose]]. Einstein was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1921|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1921]].&lt;ref name="frs" /&gt; He also received the [[Copley Medal]] from the [[Royal Society]] in 1925.&lt;ref name="frs" /&gt;

=== 19211922: Travels abroad ===
[[File:League of Nations Commission 067.tif|thumb|Albert Einstein at a session of the [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]] ([[League of Nations]]) of which he was a member from 1922 to 1932.]]Einstein visited New York City for the first time on 2 April 1921, where he received an official welcome by Mayor [[John Francis Hylan]], followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions. He went on to deliver several lectures at [[Columbia University]] and [[Princeton University]], and in Washington he accompanied representatives of the [[National Academy of Science]] on a visit to the [[White House]]. On his return to Europe he was the guest of the British statesman and philosopher [[Viscount Haldane]] in London, where he met several renowned scientific, intellectual and political figures, and delivered a lecture at [[King's College London]].{{Sfnp|Hoffmann|1972|pp=145148}} {{Sfnp|Flsing|1997|pp=499508}}

He also published an essay, "My First Impression of the U.S.A.," in July 1921, in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics of Americans, much as had [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], who published his own impressions in ''[[Democracy in America]]'' (1835).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.einsteinsworld.com/News-New-York-Herald-Tribune-1931-As-Einstein-Sees-America.htm "As Einstein Sees American"], ''Einstein's World'', a 1931 reprint with minor changes, of his 1921 essay.&lt;/ref&gt; For some of his observations, Einstein was clearly surprised: "What strikes a visitor is the joyous, positive attitude to life . . . The American is friendly, self-confident, optimistic, and without envy."&lt;ref name=Holton /&gt;{{rp|20}}

In 1922, his travels took him to Asia and later to Palestine, as part of a six-month excursion and speaking tour, as he visited [[Singapore]], [[Ceylon]] and [[Japan]], where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of Japanese. After his first public lecture, he met the emperor and empress at the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Imperial Palace]], where thousands came to watch. In a letter to his sons, he described his impression of the Japanese as being modest, intelligent, considerate, and having a true feel for art.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=307308}}

Because of Einstein's travels to the Far East, he was unable to personally accept the Nobel Prize for Physics at the Stockholm award ceremony in December 1922. In his place, the banquet speech was held by a German diplomat, who praised Einstein not only as a scientist but also as an international peacemaker and activist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/einstein-speech.html The Nobel Prize in Physics 1921: Albert Einstein. Banquet Speech by R. Nadolny (in German).] Retrieved 9 December 2015 via Nobelprize.org&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return voyage, he visited [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] for 12 days in what would become his only visit to that region. He was greeted as if he were a head of state, rather than a physicist, which included a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the British high commissioner, [[Sir Herbert Samuel]]. During one reception, the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him. In Einstein's talk to the audience, he expressed happiness that the Jewish people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=308}}

Einstein visited Spain for two weeks in 1923, where he briefly met [[Santiago Ramn y Cajal]] and also received a diploma from [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso XIII]] naming him a member of the Spanish Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montes-Santiago|first=J.|date=2017-07-16|title=[The meeting of Einstein with Cajal (Madrid, 1923): a lost tide of fortune]|journal=Revista De Neurologia|volume=43|issue=2|pages=113117|issn=0210-0010|pmid=16838259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1922 to 1932, Einstein was a member of the [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]] of the [[League of Nations]] in [[Geneva]], a body created to promote international exchange between scientists, researchers, teachers, artists and intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = | issue = 2| last = Grandjean| first = Martin| title = Analisi e visualizzazioni delle reti in storia.

=== 19301931: Travel to the U.S. ===
In December 1930, Einstein visited America for the second time, originally intended as a two-month working visit as a research fellow at the [[California Institute of Technology]]. After the national attention he received during his first trip to the U.S., he and his arrangers aimed to protect his privacy. Although swamped with telegrams and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly, he declined them all.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=368}}

After arriving in New York City, Einstein was taken to various places and events, including [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], a lunch with the editors of the ''New York Times'', and a performance of ''Carmen'' at the [[Metropolitan Opera]], where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival. During the days following, he was given the keys to the city by Mayor [[Jimmy Walker]] and met the president of Columbia University, who described Einstein as "the ruling monarch of the mind".{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=370}} [[Harry Emerson Fosdick]], pastor at New York's [[Riverside Church]], gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full-size statue that the church made of Einstein, standing at the entrance.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=370}} Also during his stay in New York, he joined a crowd of 15,000 people at [[Madison Square Garden]] during a [[Hanukkah]] celebration.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=370}}

[[File:Albert Einstein and Charlie Chaplin - 1931.jpg|thumb|left|Einstein (left) and [[Charlie Chaplin]] at the [[Hollywood]] premiere of ''[[City Lights]]'', January 1931]]
Einstein next traveled to California, where he met [[Caltech]] president and Nobel laureate, [[Robert A. Millikan]]. His friendship with Millikan was "awkward", as Millikan "had a penchant for patriotic militarism," where Einstein was a pronounced [[Pacifism|pacifist]].{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=373}} During an address to Caltech's students, Einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=374}}

This aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author [[Upton Sinclair]] and film star [[Charlie Chaplin]], both noted for their pacifism. [[Carl Laemmle]], head of [[Universal Studios]], gave Einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to Chaplin. They had an instant rapport, with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to his home for dinner. Chaplin said Einstein's outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a "highly emotional temperament," from which came his "extraordinary intellectual energy".&lt;ref name=Chaplin&gt;Chaplin, Charles. ''Charles Chaplin: My Autobiography'', Simon and Schuster, N.Y. (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|320}}

Chaplin's film, ''[[City Lights]]'', was to premiere a few days later in Hollywood, and Chaplin invited Einstein and Elsa to join him as his special guests. [[Walter Isaacson]], Einstein's biographer, described this as "one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity".{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=374}} Chaplin visited Einstein at his home on a later trip to Berlin, and recalled his "modest little flat" and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory.

=== 1933: Emigration to the U.S. ===

In February 1933 while on a visit to the United States, Einstein knew he could not return to Germany with the rise to power of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] under Germany's new chancellor, [[Adolf Hitler]].{{Sfnp|Flsing|1997|p=659}}{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=404}}

While at American universities in early 1933, he undertook his third two-month visiting professorship at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in Pasadena. He and his wife Elsa returned to Belgium by ship in March, and during the trip they learned that their cottage was raided by the Nazis and his personal sailboat confiscated. Upon landing in [[Antwerp]] on 28 March, he immediately went to the German consulate and surrendered his passport, formally renouncing his German citizenship.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=407410}} The Nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a [[Hitler Youth]] camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/albert-einstein-how-i-see-the-world/585/ |title=Albert Einstein: How I See the World |work=American Masters |publisher=PBS |author=Richard Kroehling |date=July 1991 |accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Refugee status ====
[[File:Einstein's landing card (5706142737).jpg|thumb|Albert Einstein's landing card (26 May 1933), when he landed in [[Dover]] ([[United Kingdom]]) from [[Ostende]] ([[Belgium]]) to visit [[Oxford]].]]
In April 1933, Einstein discovered that the new German government had passed laws barring Jews from holding any official positions, including teaching at universities.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=407410}} Historian [[Gerald Holton]] describes how, with "virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues", thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed.&lt;ref name=Holton&gt;Holton, Gerald. [https://books.google.com/books?id=prgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA18 "The migration of physicists to the United States"], ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'', Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc., April 1984 pp. 1824&lt;/ref&gt;

A month later, Einstein's works were among those targeted by the [[German Student Union]] in the [[Nazi book burnings]], with Nazi propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] proclaiming, "Jewish intellectualism is dead."{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=407410}} One German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase, "not yet hanged", offering a $5,000 bounty on his head.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=407410}}&lt;ref name=Jerome&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fred Jerome|author2=Rodger Taylor|title=Einstein on Race and Racism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4d79VQdOfFUC&amp;pg=PR10|year=2006|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3952-2|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent letter to physicist and friend [[Max Born]], who had already emigrated from Germany to England, Einstein wrote, "...&amp;nbsp;I must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise."{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=407410}} After moving to the U.S., he described the book burnings as a "spontaneous emotional outburst" by those who "shun popular enlightenment," and "more than anything else in the world, fear the influence of men of intellectual independence."{{Sfnp|Einstein|1954|p=197}}

Einstein was now without a permanent home, unsure where he would live and work, and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in Germany. He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he lived for a few months. In late July 1933, he went to England for about six weeks at the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander [[Oliver Locker-Lampson]], who had become friends with Einstein in the preceding years. To protect Einstein, Locker-Lampson had two assistants watch over him at his secluded cottage outside London, with photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein, published in the ''Daily Herald'' on 24 July 1933.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=422}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/co8223551/professor-einstein-with-commander-locker-lampson-gelatin-silver-print-photograph "Professor Einstein with Commander Locker-Lampson"], ScienceMuseum.org, U.K.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locker-Lampson took Einstein to meet [[Winston Churchill]] at his home, and later, [[Austen Chamberlain]] and former Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]].{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=419420}} Einstein asked them to help bring Jewish scientists out of Germany. British historian [[Martin Gilbert]] notes that Churchill responded immediately, and sent his friend, physicist [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Frederick Lindemann]] to Germany to seek out Jewish scientists and place them in British universities.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;Gilbert, Martin. ''Churchill and the Jews'', Henry Holt and Company, N.Y. (2007) pp. 101, 176&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill later observed that as a result of Germany having driven the Jews out, they had lowered their "technical standards" and put [[Allies of World War II|the Allies']] technology ahead of theirs.&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt;

Einstein later contacted leaders of other nations, including [[Turkey]]'s Prime Minister, [[smet nn]], to whom he wrote in September 1933 requesting placement of unemployed German-Jewish scientists. As a result of Einstein's letter, Jewish invitees to Turkey eventually totaled over "1,000 saved individuals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Reisman | first=Arnold | url=http://hnn.us/article/31946 | title=What a Freshly Discovered Einstein Letter Says About Turkey Today | publisher=History News Network, George Masons University | date=20 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locker-Lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend British citizenship to Einstein, during which period Einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in Europe.{{Sfnp|Clark|1971}} In one of his speeches he denounced Germany's treatment of Jews, while at the same time he introduced a bill promoting Jewish citizenship in Palestine, as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;"Denunciation of German Policy is a Stirring Event", ''Associated Press'', 27 July 1933&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech he described Einstein as a "citizen of the world" who should be offered a temporary shelter in the U.K.&lt;ref group=note&gt;"Their leaders in Germany have not driven out her cut-throats and her blackguards. She has chosen the cream of her culture and has suppressed it. She has even turned upon her most glorious citizen, Albert Einstein, who is the supreme example of the selfless intellectual...The man, who, beyond all others, approximates a citizen of the world, is without a home. How proud we must be to offer him temporary shelter."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;"Stateless Jews: The Exiles from Germany, Nationality Plan", ''The Guardian'' (U.K.) 27 July 1933&lt;/ref&gt; Both bills failed, however, and Einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], U.S., to become a resident scholar.{{Sfnp|Clark|1971}}

==== Resident scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study ====
[[File:Einstein-formal portrait-35.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Einstein taken in 1935 at Princeton]]
In October 1933 Einstein returned to the U.S. and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study,{{Sfnp|Clark|1971}}{{Sfnp|Flsing|1997|pp=649, 678}} noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="Arntzenius2011" /&gt; At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, as a result of their [[Jewish quota]] which lasted until the late 1940s.&lt;ref name="Arntzenius2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Linda G. | last=Arntzenius|title=Institute for Advanced Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zHHguITir80C&amp;pg=PA19|date=2011|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-7409-7|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein was still undecided on his future. He had offers from several European universities, including [[Christ Church, Oxford]] where he stayed for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933 and was offered a 5-year studentship,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Oxford Chabad Society |url=http://www.oxfordchabad.org/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/457396/jewish/Albert-Einstein.htm |title=Oxford Jewish Personalities: |accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Oxford Times |date=2012 |url=http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/leisure/history_heritage/9617968.How_Einstein_fled_from_the_Nazis_to_an_Oxford_college/ |title=How Einstein fled from the Nazis to an Oxford college |accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1935 he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship.{{Sfnp|Clark|1971}}{{Sfnp|Flsing|1997|pp=686687}}

Einstein's affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until his death in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ias.edu/people/einstein/in-brief |title=In Brief |publisher=Institute for Advanced Study |accessdate=4 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100329064405/http://www.ias.edu/people/einstein/in-brief| archivedate= 29 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the four first selected (two of the others being [[John von Neumann]] and [[Kurt Gdel]]) at the new Institute, where he soon developed a close friendship with Gdel. The two would take long walks together discussing their work. [[Bruria Kaufman]], his assistant, later became a physicist. During this period, Einstein tried to develop a [[unified field theory]] and to refute the [[Copenhagen interpretation|accepted interpretation]] of [[quantum physics]], both unsuccessfully.

==== World War II and the Manhattan Project ====
{{See also|EinsteinSzilrd letter}}
In 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included migr physicist [[Le Szilrd]] attempted to alert Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. The group's warnings were discounted. Einstein and Szilrd, along with other refugees such as [[Edward Teller]] and [[Eugene Wigner]], "regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the [[German nuclear energy project|race to build an atomic bomb]], and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon."{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=630}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gosling |first=F.

Roosevelt|Roosevelt]], recommending the U.S. pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.

The letter is believed to be "arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=J.

Some say that as a result of Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the U.S. entered the "race" to develop the bomb, drawing on its "immense material, financial, and scientific resources" to initiate the [[Manhattan Project]].

For Einstein, "war was a disease&amp;nbsp;... [and] he called for resistance to war." By signing the letter to Roosevelt, some argue he went against his pacifist principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Einstein, Albert |date=1952 |title=On My Participation in the Atom Bomb Project |url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/Hiroshima/EinsteinResponse.shtml |publisher=AJ Software &amp; Multimedia |via=atomicarchive.org |page= |accessdate=2015-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, [[Linus Pauling]], "I made one great mistake in my lifewhen I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justificationthe danger that the Germans would make them&amp;nbsp;..."{{Sfnp|Clark|1971|p=???}}

==== U.S. citizenship ====
[[File:Citizen-Einstein.jpg|thumb|Einstein accepting [[Citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizenship]] certificate from judge [[Phillip Forman]]]]
Einstein became an American citizen in 1940. Not long after settling into his career at the Institute for Advanced Study (in Princeton, New Jersey), he expressed his appreciation of the [[meritocracy]] in American culture when compared to Europe. He recognized the "right of individuals to say and think what they pleased", without social barriers, and as a result, individuals were encouraged, he said, to be more creative, a trait he valued from his own early education.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=432}}

=== Personal life ===

==== Supporter of civil rights ====
Einstein was a passionate, committed antiracist and joined [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in Princeton, where he campaigned for the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (18961954)|civil rights]] of African Americans. He considered racism America's "worst disease,"&lt;ref name="Jerome" /&gt; seeing it as "handed down from one generation to the next".&lt;ref&gt;Calaprice, Alice (2005) ''[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7921.html The new quotable Einstein] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622063213/http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7921.html |date=22 June 2009 }}''. pp.148149 Princeton University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his involvement, he corresponded with civil rights activist [[W.

''Paul Robeson Speaks'', Citadel (2002) p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|565}} When Einstein offered to be a character witness for Du Bois, the judge decided to drop the case.&lt;ref name=civil /&gt;

[[File:Albert Einstein Head.jpg|thumb|Einstein in 1947]]
In 1946 Einstein visited [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]] in Pennsylvania, a [[historically black college]], where he was awarded an honorary degree. (Lincoln was the first university in the United States to grant college degrees to [[African Americans]]; alumni include [[Langston Hughes]] and [[Thurgood Marshall]].)

==== Assisting Zionist causes ====
Einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], which opened in 1925, and was among its first Board of Governors. Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the [[World Zionist Organization]], [[Chaim Weizmann]], to help raise funds for the planned university.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=290}} He also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs.

Among those, he advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land. That should be followed, he suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as [[malaria]], which he called an "evil" that was undermining a third of the country's development.&lt;ref name=Rowe /&gt;{{rp|161}} Establishing an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic, for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments, was also important.&lt;ref name=Rowe&gt;Rowe, David E. and Schulmann, Robert, editors. ''Einstein on Politics'', Princeton University Press (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|158}}

Chaim Weizmann later became Israel's first president. Upon his death while in office in November 1952 and at the urging of [[Ezriel Carlebach]], Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] offered Einstein the position of [[President of Israel]], a mostly ceremonial post.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,817454,00.html |title=ISRAEL: Einstein Declines |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=1 December 1952 |accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenkranz|first1=Ze'ev|title=The Einstein Scrapbook|date=6 November 2002|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|location=Baltimore, Maryland, USA|isbn=978-0-8018-7203-7|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offer was presented by Israel's ambassador in Washington, [[Abba Eban]], who explained that the offer "embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons".{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=522}} Einstein declined, and wrote in his response that he was "deeply moved", and "at once saddened and ashamed" that he could not accept it.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=522}}

==== Love of music ====
{{Multiple image|direction = vertical|image1 =|image2 = Rabindranath with Einstein.jpg|caption1 = Albert Einstein playing [[violin]]|caption2 = Einstein (right) with writer, musician and Nobel laureate [[Rabindranath Tagore]], 1930|align = right}}
Einstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age, and later wrote: "If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music... I get most joy in life out of music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = The relative beauty of the violin|date = 28 January 2011|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/classical/features/the-relative-beauty-of-the-violin-2196313.html|work=[[The Independent]]|author=Duchen, Jessica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Einstein and his love of music |date=January 2005 |url=http://www.pha.jhu.edu/einstein/stuff/einstein&amp;music.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[Physics World]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828225916/http://www.pha.jhu.edu/einstein/stuff/einstein%26music.pdf |archivedate=28 August 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the [[violin]], not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into [[German culture]]. According to conductor [[Leon Botstein]], Einstein is said to have begun playing when he was 5, although he did not enjoy it at that age.&lt;ref name=Botstein /&gt;

When he turned 13, he discovered the violin sonatas of [[Mozart]], whereupon "Einstein fell in love" with Mozart's music and studied music more willingly. He taught himself to play without "ever practicing systematically", he said, deciding that "love is a better teacher than a sense of duty."&lt;ref name=Botstein&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Galison|author2=Gerald James Holton|author3=Silvan S. Schweber|title=Einstein for the 21st Century: His Legacy in Science, Art, and Modern Culture|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-13520-7|pages=161164}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 17, he was heard by a school examiner in Aarau as he played [[Beethoven]]'s [[violin sonata]]s, the examiner stating afterward that his playing was "remarkable and revealing of 'great insight'." What struck the examiner, writes Botstein, was that Einstein "displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply. Music possessed an unusual meaning for this student."&lt;ref name=Botstein /&gt;

Music took on a pivotal and permanent role in Einstein's life from that period on. Although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played [[chamber music]] were a few professionals, and he performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in Bern, Zrich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others. He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the [[Kchel catalogue]] of Mozart's work; that edition was prepared by [[Alfred Einstein]], who may have been a distant relation.&lt;ref&gt;Article "Alfred Einstein", in ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', ed.

In 1931, while engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology, he visited the Zoellner family conservatory in Los Angeles, where he played some of Beethoven and Mozart's works with members of the [[Zoellner Quartet]].&lt;ref name=Times&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1985-12-22/entertainment/ca-20526_1_life-estate Cariaga, Daniel, "Not Taking It with You: A Tale of Two Estates," ''Los Angeles Times''], 22 December 1985.

During his days at Oxford, he was accompanied by [[Russi Mody]] on the piano, while he played the violin. Mody would occasionally fill in knowledge gaps that Einstein had in Nuclear Physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.forbesindia.com/article/special/remembering-russi-mody/37816/1|title=Remembering Russi Mody {{!}} Forbes India|website=Forbes India|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rediff.com/chat/modychat.htm|title=Rediff On The NeT: Transcript of the Russi Mody Chat|last=|first=|date=|website=www.rediff.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56368553|title=Russi Mody : the man and his vision|last=Niharika.|first=Seth,|date=2004|publisher=Rupa &amp; Co|year=|isbn=8129103257|location=New Delhi|pages=96|oclc=56368553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for his affiliations, Einstein was primarily associated with non-religious [[secular humanist|humanist]] and [[Ethical Culture]] groups in both the U.K. and U.S. He served on the advisory board of the [[First Humanist Society of New York]],&lt;ref&gt;Dowbiggin, Ian (2003).

=== Death ===
On 17 April 1955, Einstein experienced [[internal bleeding]] caused by the rupture of an [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]], which had previously been reinforced surgically by [[Rudolph Nissen]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/436253 |title=The Case of the Scientist with a Pulsating Mass |date=14 June 2002 |accessdate=11 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the State of Israel's seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live long enough to complete it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Albert Einstein Archives |contribution=Draft of projected Telecast Israel Independence Day, April 1955 (last statement ever written) |title=Einstein Archives Online |date=April 1955 |contribution-url=http://alberteinstein.info/vufind1/Digital/EAR000020078#page/1/mode/1up |url=http://www.alberteinstein.info/ |accessdate=14 March 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070313231657/http://www.alberteinstein.info/| archivedate= 13 March 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was published in 1901 with the title "Folgerungen aus den Capillarittserscheinungen", which translates as "Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena". Two papers he published in 19021903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret [[atom]]ic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.&lt;ref name=PubList /&gt;

==== Theory of critical opalescence ====
{{Main|Critical opalescence}}
Einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to [[Rayleigh scattering]], which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Levenson |first=Thomas |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/einstein/genius/ |title=Einstein's Big Idea |publisher=WBGH |type=public broadcaster website |via=NOVA by [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS), Arlington, VA, USA |location=Boston, MA, USA |date=9 September 1997 |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.

=== Special relativity ===

==== General principles ====
He articulated the [[principle of relativity]]. This was understood by [[Hermann Minkowski]] to be a generalization of rotational invariance from space to space-time. Other principles postulated by Einstein and later vindicated are the [[principle of equivalence]], [[general covariance]] and the principle of [[adiabatic invariant|adiabatic invariance]] of the quantum number.

==== Theory of relativity and ''E'' = ''mc'' ====
{{Main|History of special relativity}}
Einstein's "''Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Krper''" ("On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies") was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciles [[Maxwell's equations]] for electricity and magnetism with the laws of mechanics, by introducing major changes to mechanics close to the [[speed of light]]. This later became known as Einstein's special theory of relativity.

Consequences of this include the [[Spacetime|timespace frame]] of a moving body appearing to [[Time dilation|slow down]] and [[Length contraction|contract]] (in the direction of motion) when measured in the frame of the observer. This paper also argued that the idea of a [[luminiferous aether]]one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the timewas superfluous.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1905d}}

In his paper on [[massenergy equivalence]], Einstein produced ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; from his special relativity equations.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|pp=vi, 15, 90, 131, [https://books.google.com/?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&amp;pg=PA215 215]}} Einstein's 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with [[Max Planck]].&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the reception of relativity theory around the world, and the different controversies it encountered, see the articles in Thomas F. Glick, ed., ''The Comparative Reception of Relativity'' (Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1987), {{ISBN|90-277-2498-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=382386}}

[[File:1919 eclipse positive.jpg|alt=Black circle covering the sun, rays visible around it, in a dark sky.|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Stanley Eddington|Eddington]]'s photograph of a [[solar eclipse]]]]
General relativity (GR) is a [[theory of gravitation]] that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to [[general relativity]], the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of [[spacetime|space and time]] by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern [[astrophysics]]. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of [[black holes]], regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.

As Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within [[special relativity]] was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1923}} Consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity. In that article titled "On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It", he argued that [[free fall]] is really inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the [[equivalence principle]]. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of [[gravitational time dilation]], [[gravitational red shift]] and [[Gravitational lensing|deflection of light]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=179183}}{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 2: The Swiss Years: Writings, 19001909|pp=273274}}

In 1911, Einstein published another article "On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally.{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=194195}}

====Gravitational waves====
In 1916, Einstein predicted [[gravitational wave]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Einstein, A |title=Nherungsweise Integration der Feldgleichungen der Gravitation |date= June 1916 |url=http://einstein-annalen.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/related_texts/sitzungsberichte |journal=[[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Sitzungsberichte der Kniglich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften Berlin]] |volume=part 1|pages=688696}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Einstein, A |title=ber Gravitationswellen |date=1918 |url=http://einstein-annalen.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/related_texts/sitzungsberichte |journal=Sitzungsberichte der Kniglich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften Berlin|volume=part 1|pages=154167}}&lt;/ref&gt; ripples in the [[curvature]] of spacetime which propagate as [[wave]]s, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its [[Lorentz invariance]] which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newtonian theory of gravitation]], which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.

The first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting [[neutron stars]], [[PSR B1913+16]].&lt;ref name="natgeo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/02/160211-gravitational-waves-found-spacetime-science/ |title=Found!

==== Hole argument and Entwurf theory ====
{{Main|Hole argument}}
While developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the [[gauge invariance]] in the theory. He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations, and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.

In June 1913, the Entwurf ("draft") theory was the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the [[hole argument]] was mistaken&lt;ref&gt;van Dongen, Jeroen (2010) ''Einstein's Unification'' Cambridge University Press, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; and abandoned the theory in November 1915.

==== Physical cosmology ====
{{Main|Physical cosmology}}
{{cosmology|scientists}}
In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917a}} He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the [[cosmological constant]], to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of [[Mach's principle]] in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or [[Einstein's static universe]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1994|pp=285286}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=North|first1=J.D.|title=The Measure of the Universe: A History of Modern Cosmology|date=1965|publisher=Dover|location=New York|pages=8183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, [[The Friedmann-Einstein universe]] of 1931&lt;ref name="einstein-1931"&gt;Einstein, A. 1931.

In many Einstein biographies, it is claimed that Einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his "biggest blunder". The astrophysicist [[Mario Livio]] has recently cast doubt on this claim, suggesting that it may be exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/books/review/brilliant-blunders-by-mario-livio.html|title=The Genius of Getting It Wrong|date=9 June 2013|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2013, a team led by the Irish physicist [[Cormac O'Raifeartaigh]] discovered evidence that, shortly after learning of Hubble's observations of the recession of the nebulae, Einstein considered a [[Steady State theory|steady-state model]] of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/einstein-s-lost-theory-uncovered-1.14767|title=Einsteins lost theory uncovered|work=Nature News &amp; Comment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/outthere/2014/03/14/135th-birthday-einstein-still-full-surprises/#.UybABMHiG9V|title=On His 135th Birthday, Einstein is Still Full of Surprises|work=Out There}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, Einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter, a process he associated with the cosmological constant.&lt;ref name="cor-steady-state"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Raifeartaigh | first1 = C. | last2 = McCann | first2 = B. | last3 = Nahm | first3 = W. | last4 = Mitton | first4 = S. | year = 2014 | title = Einstein's steady-state theory: an abandoned model of the cosmos | arxiv=1402.0132 | journal = Eur.

'Einsteins aborted attempt at a dynamic steady state universe.

"If one considers a physically bounded volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving it. For the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space."

It thus appears that Einstein considered a [[Steady State theory|steady-state model]] of the expanding universe many years before Hoyle, Bondi and Gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoyle | first1 =  | year = 1948 | title = A New Model for the Expanding Universe | url = | journal = MNRAS | volume = 108 | issue = 5| page = 372 |bibcode=1948MNRAS.108..372H | doi=10.1093/mnras/108.5.372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bondi | first1 =  | last2 = Gold | first2 =  | year = 1948 | title = The Steady-State Theory of the Expanding Universe | url = | journal = MNRAS | volume = 108 | issue = 3| page = 252 |bibcode=1948MNRAS.108..252B | doi=10.1093/mnras/108.3.252}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Einstein's steady-state model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea.&lt;ref name="cor-steady-state"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Einsteins aborted model"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2014/03/07/einsteins-lost-theory-describes-a-universe-without-a-big-bang/#.Uya3EcHiG9U|title=Einstein's Lost Theory Describes a Universe Without a Big Bang  The Crux|work=The Crux}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Energy momentum pseudotensor ====
{{Main|Stressenergymomentum pseudotensor}}
General relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. [[Noether's theorem]] allows these quantities to be determined from a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] with [[Translational symmetry|translation invariance]], but [[general covariance]] makes translation invariance into something of a [[gauge symmetry]]. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.

Einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by [[Lev Landau]] and [[Evgeny Lifshitz]], and others, and has become standard.

The use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by [[Erwin Schrdinger]] and others.

==== Wormholes ====
{{Main|Wormhole}}
In 1935, Einstein collaborated with [[Nathan Rosen]] to produce a model of a [[wormhole]], often called [[EinsteinRosen bridges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Einstein, Albert |author2=Rosen, Nathan |last-author-amp=yes |date=1935 |title=The Particle Problem in the General Theory of Relativity |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=48 |page=73 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.48.73 |bibcode=1935PhRv...48...73E}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015  General Relativitys Centennial|publisher=[[American Physical Society]]|date=2015|url=https://journals.aps.org/general-relativity-centennial|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper "Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?". These solutions cut and pasted [[Schwarzschild black hole]]s to make a bridge between two patches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Focus: The Birth of Wormholes|first=David | last=Lindley|url=https://physics.aps.org/story/v15/st11|publisher=American Physical Society|date=25 March 2005|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one end of a wormhole was positively charged, the other end would be negatively charged. These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way.

==== EinsteinCartan theory ====
{{Main|EinsteinCartan theory}}
[[File:Albert Einstein photo 1920.jpg|alt=Einstein, sitting at a table, looks up from the papers he is reading and into the camera.|thumb|upright|Einstein at his office, [[University of Berlin]], 1920]]In order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the [[Torsion tensor|torsion]]. This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.

==== Equations of motion ====
{{Main|EinsteinInfeldHoffmann equations}}
The theory of general relativity has a fundamental lawthe [[Einstein equations]] which describe how space curves, the [[geodesic equation]] which describes how particles move may be derived from the Einstein equations.

Since the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.

This was established by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum, and by [[Roy Kerr]] for spinning objects.

=== Old quantum theory ===
{{Main|Old quantum theory}}

==== Photons and energy quanta ====
[[File:Photoelectric effect.svg|thumb|upright|The photoelectric effect. Incoming photons on the left strike a metal plate (bottom), and eject electrons, depicted as flying off to the right.]]
{{Main|Photon|Quantum}}
In a 1905 paper,{{Sfnp|Einstein|1905a}} Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (''[[quantum|quanta]]''). Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with [[Robert Millikan]]'s detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of [[Compton scattering]].

Einstein concluded that each wave of frequency ''f'' is associated with a collection of [[photon]]s with energy ''hf'' each, where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]]. He does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave. But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.{{sfnp|Einstein|1905a}}

==== Quantized atomic vibrations ====
{{Main|Einstein solid}}
In 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independentlya series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. [[Peter Debye]] refined this model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/nuggets/einstein/solidcolda.html Celebrating Einstein "Solid Cold". U.S. DOE.], [[Office of Scientific and Technical Information]], 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Adiabatic principle and action-angle variables ====
{{main|Adiabatic invariant}}
Throughout the 1910s, quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems. After [[Ernest Rutherford]] discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the [[periodic table of the elements]].

Einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments [[Wilhelm Wien]] had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of [[adiabatic invariant|adiabatic invariance]] of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the [[blackbody radiation|blackbody curves]] at different temperature to be derived from one another by a [[Wien's displacement law|simple shifting process]]. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] identified this adiabatic invariant as the [[action-angle variables|action variable]] of classical mechanics.

==== BoseEinstein statistics ====
{{Main|BoseEinstein statistics}}
In 1924, Einstein received a description of a [[statistical mechanics|statistical]] model from Indian physicist [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the ''[[Zeitschrift fr Physik]]''. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the [[BoseEinstein condensate]] phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1924}} It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by [[Eric Allin Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]] using [[ultracold atom|ultra-cooling]] equipment built at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]][[JILA]] laboratory at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/n01-04.htm |title=Cornell and Wieman Share 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics |date=9 October 2001 |accessdate=11 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610080506/https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/n01-04.htm |archivedate=10 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; BoseEinstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of [[boson]]s. Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.&lt;ref name=Instituut-Lorentz /&gt;

==== Waveparticle duality ====
[[File:Albert Einstein photo 1921.jpg|thumb|upright|Einstein during his visit to the United States]]
{{Main|Waveparticle duality}}
Although the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. In 1908, he became a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at the University of Bern.{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|p=522}} In "''ber die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen ber das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung''" ("[[s:The Development of Our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation|The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation]]"), on the [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well-defined [[momentum|momenta]] and act in some respects as independent, [[point particle|point-like particles]]. This paper introduced the ''photon'' concept (although the name ''photon'' was introduced later by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] in 1926) and inspired the notion of [[waveparticle duality]] in [[quantum mechanics]]. Einstein saw this waveparticle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation.

==== Zero-point energy ====
{{Main|Zero-point energy}}
In a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero-point energy in his "second quantum theory". Soon, this idea attracted the attention of Einstein and his assistant [[Otto Stern]]. Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data. The numbers matched nicely. However, after publishing the findings, they promptly withdrew their support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero-point energy.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 4: The Swiss Years: Writings, 19121914|pp=270ff}}

==== Stimulated emission ====
{{main|Stimulated emission}}
In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in ''Physikalische Zeitschrift'' that proposed the possibility of [[stimulated emission]], the physical process that makes possible the [[maser]] and the [[laser]].{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917b}}
This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.

==== Matter waves ====
{{main|Matter wave}}
Einstein discovered [[Louis de Broglie]]'s work and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for [[Matter wave|de Broglie waves]], which Einstein suggested was the [[HamiltonJacobi equation]] of mechanics. This paper would inspire Schrdinger's work of 1926.

=== Quantum mechanics ===
==== Einstein's objections to quantum mechanics ====
[[File:NYT May 4, 1935.jpg|thumb|Newspaper headline on 4 May 1935]]
Einstein was displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925. Contrary to popular belief, his doubts were not due to a conviction that God "is not playing at dice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Penguin Dictionary of Modern Quotations |first1=Robert |last1=Andrews |publisher=Penguin UK |date=2003 |isbn=0-14-196531-2 |page=499 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VK0vR4fsaigC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=VK0vR4fsaigC&amp;pg=PT499 Extract of page 499]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it was Einstein himself, in his 1917 paper that proposed the possibility of [[stimulated emission]],{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917b}} who first proposed the fundamental role of chance in explaining quantum processes.{{Sfnp|Stone|2013|pp=181192}} Rather, he objected to what quantum mechanics implies about the nature of reality. Einstein believed that a physical reality exists independent of our ability to observe it. In contrast, Bohr and his followers maintained that all we can know are the results of measurements and observations, and that it makes no sense to speculate about an ultimate reality that exists beyond our perceptions.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=460461}}

==== Bohr versus Einstein ====
{{Main|BohrEinstein debates}}
[[File:Niels Bohr Albert Einstein by Ehrenfest.jpg|upright|alt=Two men sitting, looking relaxed. A dark-haired Bohr is talking while Einstein looks sceptical.|thumb|Einstein and [[Niels Bohr]], 1925]] The BohrEinstein debates were a series of public disputes about [[quantum mechanics]] between Einstein and [[Niels Bohr]], who were two of its founders. Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the [[philosophy of science]].&lt;ref name="Bohr1949"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/dk/bohr.htm | title = Discussions with Einstein on Epistemological Problems in Atomic Physics | accessdate =30 August 2010 | author = Bohr N | work=The Value of Knowledge: A Miniature Library of Philosophy | publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100913033345/http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/dk/bohr.htm| archivedate= 13 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}} From Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist (1949), publ.

==== EinsteinPodolskyRosen paradox ====
{{Main|EPR paradox}}
In 1935, Einstein returned to the question of quantum mechanics in the [[EPR paradox|"EPR paper"]].{{Sfnp|Einstein|Podolsky|Rosen|1935}} In a [[Einstein's thought experiments|thought experiment]], he considered two particles which had interacted such that their properties were strongly correlated. No matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the position of the other particle; likewise a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the momentum of the other particle, without needing to disturb the other particle in any way.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|loc=pp.448453}}

Given Einstein's concept of [[local realism]], there were two possibilities: (1) either the other particle had these properties already determined, or (2) the process of measuring the first particle instantaneously affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle. Einstein rejected this second possibility (popularly called "spooky action at a distance").{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|loc=pp.448453}}

This principle distilled the essence of Einstein's objection to quantum mechanics. As a physical principle, it was shown to be incorrect when the [[Aspect experiment]] of 1982 confirmed [[Bell's theorem]], which [[J. S. Bell]] had delineated in 1964. The results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the classical picture of physics.{{Sfnp|Penrose|2007|p=583}}

Although Einstein was wrong, his clear prediction of the unusual properties of [[Quantum entanglement|''entangled quantum states'']] has resulted in the EPR paper becoming among the top ten papers published in [[Physical Review]]. It is considered a centerpiece of the development of [[quantum information theory]].{{Sfnp|Fine|2017}}

=== Unified field theory ===
{{Main|Classical unified field theories}}
Following his research on general relativity, Einstein entered into a series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as another aspect of a single entity. In 1950, he described his "[[unified field theory]]" in a ''[[Scientific American]]'' article titled "On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation".{{Sfnp|Einstein|1950}} Although he continued to be lauded for his work, Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research, and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.
In his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the [[strong nuclear force|strong]] and [[weak nuclear force]]s, which were not well understood until many years after his death. Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein's approaches to unification. Einstein's dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a [[theory of everything]] and in particular [[string theory]], where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.

=== Other investigations ===
{{Main|Einstein's unsuccessful investigations}}
Einstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned. These pertain to [[force]], [[superconductivity]], and other research.

=== Collaboration with other scientists ===
[[File:Solvay conference 1927.jpg|thumb|The 1927 [[Solvay Conference]] in Brussels, a gathering of the world's top physicists. Einstein is in the center.]]
In addition to longtime collaborators [[Leopold Infeld]], [[Nathan Rosen]], [[Peter Bergmann]] and others, Einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists.

==== Einsteinde Haas experiment ====
{{Main|Einsteinde Haas effect}}
Einstein and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a [[torsion pendulum]]. They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive, because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.

==== Schrdinger gas model ====
Einstein suggested to Erwin Schrdinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a [[BoseEinstein condensate|BoseEinstein gas]] by considering a box. Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.

This formulation is a form of [[second quantization]], but it predates modern quantum mechanics. Erwin Schrdinger applied this to derive the [[thermodynamic]] properties of a [[Quantum chaos|semiclassical]] [[ideal gas]]. Schrdinger urged Einstein to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the invitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Moore |first=Walter |date=1989 |title=Schrdinger: Life and Thought |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-43767-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Einstein refrigerator ====
{{Main|Einstein refrigerator}}
In 1926, Einstein and his former student Le Szilrd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the [[Einstein refrigerator]]. This [[absorption refrigerator]] was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input.&lt;ref name="Goettling"&gt;Goettling, Gary.

Their invention was not immediately put into commercial production, and the most promising of their patents were acquired by the Swedish company [[Electrolux]].&lt;ref&gt;In September 2008 it was reported that Malcolm McCulloch of Oxford University was heading a three-year project to develop more robust appliances that could be used in locales lacking electricity, and that his team had completed a prototype Einstein refrigerator. He was quoted as saying that improving the design and changing the types of gases used might allow the design's efficiency to be quadrupled.{{Citation | last = Alok | first = Jha | title = Einstein fridge design can help global cooling |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date = 21 September 2008 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/sep/21/scienceofclimatechange.climatechange | accessdate =22 February 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110124172925/http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/sep/21/scienceofclimatechange.climatechange| archivedate= 24 January 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-scientific legacy ==
While traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse. The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to [[The Hebrew University]].

{{Main|Albert Einstein in popular culture}}
In the period before World War II, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' published a vignette in their "The Talk of the Town" feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain "that theory". He finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries. He told his inquirers "Pardon me, sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1939/01/14/1939_01_14_011_TNY_CARDS_000176356|title=Disguise|first=E. | last=Libman|date=14 January 1939|work=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, plays, and works of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cindymctee.com/einsteins_dream.html |title=Einstein's Dream for orchestra |first=Cindy |last=McTee |publisher=Cindymctee.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a favorite model for depictions of [[mad scientist]]s and [[absent-minded professor]]s; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's Frederic Golden wrote that Einstein was "a cartoonist's dream come true".&lt;ref name="slqbwn"&gt;{{Citation|last =Golden |first =Frederic |title =Person of the Century: Albert Einstein|magazine =Time |date =3 January 2000 |url =http://www.time.com/time/time100/poc/magazine/albert_einstein5a.html |accessdate =25 February 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060221080452/http://www.time.com/time/time100/poc/magazine/albert_einstein5a.html| archivedate= 21 February 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and honors ==
{{Main|Einstein's awards and honors}}
Einstein received numerous awards and honors and in 1922 he was awarded the 1921 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect". None of the nominations in 1921 met the criteria set by [[Alfred Nobel]], so the 1921 prize was carried forward and awarded to Einstein in 1922.&lt;ref name="Nobel Prize"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1921 |website=Nobelprize.org |publisher=Nobel Prize |access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
